  <p>A simple demo, trying to show how a pin-hole camera works. Not really how it works, but kind of. 😉</p>


  <p>The 'film' in the back of the camera is a 'flatland' view of the scene, upside down, of course....</p>

      Krüger</strong></p>

      href="https://history.futureofcoding.org/history/weekly/2024/04/W2/share-your-work.html#2024-04-01T13:15:00.083Z">🧵

  <p>I'm currently building <a href="https://resheet.dev">resheet.dev</a>, a notion-spreadsheet-hybrid. Started because
    I often ran into limitations with Notion and with spreadsheets. In Notion I wanted to be able to just do some
    calculations (or even have some embedded spreadsheet). Spreadsheets are nice, but I always ran into limitations. I
    always thought these could easily be overcome by having a more feature-complete programming language. Because I
    previously failed very hard by being too ambitious, I tried to keep this project simple. ReSheet runs JavaScript
    with React because of the vast ecosystem and wide adoption.</p>


  <p>It was important to me that it's core is simple and extensible: Everything revolves around the concept of a
    "Block", which can be thought of like a cell in a spreadsheet. Blocks can be nested and you're able to write and
    then use your custom Block completely in ReSheet itself. As ReSheet itself is just one big Block you can embed
    ReSheet in itself.</p>


  <p>Maybe sometime in the future I'll get to work on a Block for visual and interactive programming, but currently I'm
    trying to get it reliably working and useful in the current state.</p>


  <p>I'd love to hear your feedback and to answer any questions! (Documentation is still lacking. Currently working on
    adding some example documents (in ReSheet) to better show what's possible)</p>

  <p>there's not enough information to recover them from url itself but since they are still working I should resolve

  <p>Today, I'm trying to get function signatures for all the std lib stuff in JS… at runtime. Current attempt is
    converting various d.ts files from the typescript package (like, say, es5.d.ts) into a JSON file with just the bits
    I need. If that fails, I might try parsing the official WebIDL files (that are used to generate these d.ts files —
    at least, the dom ones).</p>


  <p>If there's a much more obvious way to get this info, let me know. I basically just want something that, for a given
    function (eg: Array.prototype.splice), gives me some basic signature info (eg: 1-2 args with rest, first arg is
    called "index", optional second is called "delete", rest is "items"). If all else fails I'll just do .length on
    these functions, but I'd prefer to get names too.</p>

  <p>I've been fixing some bugs in the state-machine node-type in my visual programming system "code-flow-canvas" and
    also added a small media-library node-type which can be used by the show-image node-type.</p>


  <p>The show-image node-type can be controlled by the state-machine together with some UI node-types (button and
    slider).</p>


  <p>The show-image node-type also has an ability to change it's css and use flow parameters/variables (currently only
    the incoming value of a event/value special input-type.. I want to make this more generic in the near future so that
    you can send custom property-bags "over the wire" to other nodes).</p>


  <p>The timeline slider doesn't work together nicely with the slider node-type yet, so I have to work on that further.

  <p>This example can be found on <a href="https://demo.codeflowcanvas.io">demo.codeflowcanvas.io</a> in the "examples"
    drop down: "Simple state machine with image and brightness". </p>

  <p>A month re uploaded per week will allow me to catch up faster than "realtime" but still at a pace I can probably

  <p>A couple of years ago, I noticed how Juan Benet (founder of IPFS) was keeping <a
      href="https://github.com/jbenet/random-ideas/issues">a list of random software engg ideas</a> in a github repo as
    issues. Since then I too started keeping my own list of "RFH"s ("Request for Hacks") - similar to Request for
    Comments and Request for Startups - here: <a
      href="https://codeberg.org/nilesh/request-for-hacks/issues">codeberg.org/nilesh/request-for-hacks/issues</a> and
    recently made it public.</p>


  <p>Posting ideas in a place where public discussion can take place seems like an excellent way to get open feedback or
    review. I encourage other programmers to do the same. Perhaps, <code>/&lt;username&gt;/request-for-hacks</code> can
    become a standard way to discover these. 🙂</p>

  <p>There's a puzzle game conference called ThinkyCon that's currently running. Some of the talks are about editor
    tooling (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kgXBifWQXI&amp;t=5591s">like this one</a>, about the dev tooling
    used for the game A Monster's Expedition), which feels roughly relevant to this community. But there's one talk in
    particular that I <em>must</em> draw your attention to because this is the internet and I need to earn points. The
    talk is called "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kgXBifWQXI&amp;t=12992s">Rewinding: moving time backwards
      in planning-based games</a>". The first example they use of a game that ought to have rewind but doesn't is Opus
    Magnum, a game by Zachtronics that is the spiritual successor to SpaceChem. I'd argue that both of these games are
    visual programming environments, and that this talk is basically an argument that visual programming deserves the
    ability to rewind time.</p>

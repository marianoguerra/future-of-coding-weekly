  <p>For the last month I've been working on an arrow toolkit for the web, called Quiver 🏹. It's exploring 3 problems:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>What if visual connection could be declaratively expressed in HTML?</li>
    <li>What if there was a tiny toolkit that enabled all kinds of connection/arrows to be built?</li>
    <li>How do we break arrows out from spatial canvases and enable them to used on any website?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Currently I'm prototyping some pre-built arrows/connection: curved arrows, orthogonal edges, Xanadu links and
    hyperedges. But the library is also explicitly designed to be extensible so you can use your own layout algorithms
    or designs. Part of the extensibility means the ability to easily animate objects along the arrow (for all of those
    dataflow VPLs out there 😜) or add arbitrary labels/annotations to arrows.</p>


  <p>Given that connection is probably one of the most commonly used relationships in visual programming systems, I'm
    curious if there are any other types of arrows or functionality you would find useful in your own projects? Its not
    published to NPM yet, but the repo is <a href="https://github.com/Little-Languages/quiver">here</a>.</p>

  <p>Ink &amp; Switch are having a hack week, and I'm working on a generative sound project. You can check out the
    current version (likely to change as the week progresses) here: <a
      href="https://tonedome.surge.sh">tonedome.surge.sh</a></p>


  <p>It sounds a little different every time you run it, but it's also synced to the system clock. So if you run it on,
    say, every device you own and scatter them around the room, it creates a rather neat immersive aural space.</p>


  <p>Would appreciate any bug reports, especially on Android!</p>

  <p>I'm exploring strategies to enable scientists (biologists in pharma) without computational expertise be able to
    interact with big data more intuitively. My ultimate goal is to have users ask biological questions, and the system
    to generate and execute analytical workflows utilizing existing methods from the scientific domain to answer these
    questions with data visualizations,</p>


  <p>I evaluated the non-interpretable and inaccurate "chat your data" LLM solutions. I'm currently thinking about the
    possibilities of developing/using a DSL as intermediary output prior to code generation to make the process more
    interpretable. I am also considering what would be the most efficient abstraction strategies of the analytical
    functionalities/libraries in certain biological domains to improve the accuracy of the outputs (of the higher level
    strategy and the actual code). I would love to brainstorm about these problems offline/online. Here's my <a

  <p>I am once again looking at pages of notes I wrote three years ago attempting to find a way to declaratively diagram
    concurrent legal processes so as to illuminate the steps available to the parties as the process unfolds. I feel
    like I have something worth exploring, but to illustrate it I need a diagramming language that allows me to nest
    nodes inside of one another, and draw edges that originate and terminate at arbitrary depths of nodes. DOT won't let
    you draw an arrow starting at the edge of a subgraph, and doesn't have any way of nesting actual nodes, for example.
    Is anyone aware of a text-based graphing language that will let me nest objects and draw edges between arbitrary
    depths?</p>

  <p>I've been thinking about this tweet from John Carmack (who created Doom), and just generally about a future where
    AI does most of the coding and I'm managing AI - and... I hate it? It's not to say that I don't see this happening.
    There's a ton of capital flying around to make it happen, and I think end-users will inevitably gain the capability
    to build certain categories of simple, customised software.</p>


  <p>But as someone who has deeply loved the practice of programming for more than a decade, the future that GitHub (who
    - in the midst of me writing this - launched Copilot Workspace), Devin, and the rest are painting seems to be
    leaving out so much of nuances that comes with building anything non-trivial. I absolutely love the idea of
    operating at a higher level of abstraction (just like how I enjoy writing modern programming languages compared to C
    or assembly) and getting my ideas/work out faster. But not spending my entire day just asking AI to do things or
    reviewing code all day - which makes me wonder: how do developers even get good at reviewing code if they aren't
    spending a ton of time writing code and problem solving? What's the right level of abstraction in this "promised
    future" that lets me get into the nuances of building software for anything non-trivial and continue problem solving
    in general? This is perhaps not even a question, and just a general thought I've been thinking a lot about.</p>

  <p>I am looking around for tools / frameworks / UI patterns that are roughly of the shape "spreadsheet with editable
    computation pipeline". What do people know of that's in that category?</p>


  <p>To clarify, I realise spreadsheets alone can achieve computation... but I am thinking more of projects where the
    computation is a bit more "visual" than just formulas in cells, perhaps like a nodes or blocks environment that then
    feeds into a table / spreadsheet to display data. <strong>@Paul Shen</strong>'s Natto is one such example of the
    kind of thing I am thinking of. There might be other ways to do this beyond just a series of nodes that feed into a
    table... I'm curious to see what else might be out there already. I wonder if there are projects in the data
    analysis / computational science spaces that might fit...?</p>


  <p>Apologies if my question is too vague, I'm still trying to work out what I'm even looking for. 🙂</p>

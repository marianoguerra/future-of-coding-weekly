  <p>A new object was added to Automat over the last week - it's the final one that is needed for the MVP to work. And
    it does work! I've recorded myself writing a small C++ program and the macro recorder replayed it correctly ^^</p>


  <p>I guess I'll start posting Automat updates to Mastodon :) Here is the first one - a new Macro Recorder object was
    added this week!</p>

  <p>If you're anything like me (oof, sorry), you've heard of <a
      href="https://worrydream.com/refs/Smith_DC_1975_-_Pygmalion.pdf">Pygmalion</a> but never caught more than the
    gist. Some sort of project from the early 70s, similar to Sketchpad or Smalltalk or something, yet another promising
    prototype from the early history of our field that failed to take the world by storm. Our stock-in-trade on this
    show.</p>


  <p>But you've probably heard of Programming by Demonstration. And you've certainly heard of <em>icons</em> — you know,
    those little pictures that have become indelibly part of computing as we know it. Pygmalion is the originator of
    these concepts… and more!</p>


  <p>The best introduction to Pygmalion is <a href="https://twitter.com/warianoguerra">Mariano Guerra</a>'s <a
      href="https://instadeq.com/blog/posts/no-code-history-pygmalion-1975/">No-code History: Pygmalion</a>, which
    includes a clearly articulated summary of the big ideas, motivation, and design, with a video demonstration of the
    programming interface, key terminology, and links.</p>


  <p>The <em>most</em> introduction to Pygmalion — or Pig Million, The Millionth Pig, as it'll surely come to be known —
    is the subject of today's episode: the original paper by <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Canfield_Smith">David Canfield Smith</a>.</p>

  <p>I've just learned about Alternate Reality Kit. I've searched through the archive and it was mentioned in passing a
    couple of times but I don't think this article was ever posted: <a
      href="https://worrydream.com/refs/Smith_R_1987_-_Experiences_With_The_Alternate_Reality_Kit,_An_Example_of_the_Tension_Between_Literalism_and_Magic.pdf">Experiences
      With The Alternate Reality Kit
      An Example of the Tension Between Literalism and Magic</a> . There is also a relatively recent video upload (video
    comes from 87 but it was uploaded only three years ago) which shows a more mature version in action: <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1HhPE0zV6g">The Alternate Reality Kit</a> .</p>


  <p>Its similarity to the system that I'm developing is just uncanny! I'm very interested in learning more about it. I
    tried to follow its history to figure out why it was abandoned but I've only been able to track that its development
    eventually led to the Self language (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ka4KY7TMTU">Self and Self: Whys and
      Wherefores</a>) which honestly seems like a step back from the original. I have my theories about why it might
    have been abandoned (which is that educational software is hard to sell) but would love to learn more about it from
    the people who might know more. Or maybe there are other systems that might have been derived from it?</p>

  <p>I don't know, but I have my hypothesis as well as for why this and other user-empowering approaches were abandoned:
    the rise of PCs. In the late 80s and early 90s, the first PCs appeared and were seen as the obvious road to
    computing for everyone. But they were not powerful enough to run environments like Smalltalk. It's Basic we got
    instead. In parallel, professional high-end computing grew as well and that's where the money was. Academia followed
    the money.</p>

  <p><strong>@Joel Jakubovic</strong>’s thesis should be interesting to folks here.</p>
  <blockquote style="margin-left:1em;color:#555555;font-style:italic">

    <p> <em>Achieving Self-Sustainability in Interactive Graphical Programming Systems</em>
      Programming is fraught with accidental complexity. Software, including tools used for programming, is inflexible
      and hard to adapt to one's specific problem context. Programming tools do not support Notational Freedom, so
      programmers must waste cognitive effort expressing ideas in suboptimal notations. They must also work around
      problems caused by a reliance on plain text representations instead of Explicit Structure.</p>


    <p>The idea of a Self-Sustainable programming system, open to adaptation by its users, promises a way out of these
      accidental complexities. However, the principles underlying such a property are poorly documented, as are methods
      for practically achieving it in harmony with Notational Freedom and Explicit Structure. We trace the causes of
      this difficulty and use them to inform our construction of a prototype self-sustainable system. By carefully
      reflecting on the steps involved in our specific case, we provide insight into how self-sustainability can be
      achieved in general, and thus how a motivated programmer can escape the aforementioned sources of accidental
      complexity.</p>

      In total, the Archive includes some 29,000 items. About 50% of them have been catalogued to date and are listed on

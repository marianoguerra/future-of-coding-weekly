  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/VLf9slgin5Y">In this video</a>, I start with building a simple flow which counts the sum
    of all received values on the input ports using the new node-type "merge sum". New ports can be added dynamically
    from within the UI.</p>


  <p>This is used to simplify the PID-controller example, which now much more reflects the algorithm that is <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional%E2%80%93integral%E2%80%93derivative_controller">shown on the
      wiki-page</a>.</p>


  <p>I've also started integrating the monaco-editor (which is the base for vs.code) into code-flow-canvas.. and in the
    video you can see that it is used for editing the code behind the iframe-html-node.</p>


  <p>Another small change, is that flows now start automatically when they are loaded or after a refresh.</p>

  <p>I decided to make a pass at actually putting technical information on the <a
      href="http://calculang.dev">calculang.dev</a> frontpage.</p>


  <p>My primary audience for <a href="http://calculang.dev">calculang.dev</a> is developers - due to the wide scope, I
    think this is important (and Steve Balmer, right?).</p>


  <p>Other projects based on/around calculang will have a wider audience.</p>


  <p>It's the first time I surface some information: about introspection output to help to make tools that interact with
    models, about a comparison to spreadsheets, a rough note about my visualization APIs. I'll expand on all these
    things in longer-form separately and add illustrations for some concepts (especially "flexibility"), but for now, I
    think it's important I have some things down that I can iterate on, and happy to hear any immediate feedback,
    especially about what lands especially poorly or doesn't fit! (since this is a community of developers, your
    feedback would be awesome for me to get to work)</p>


  <p>I intend to push the Examples to a Gallery or Playground page instead, with just a more subtle carousal or such
    surfaced early in the main page</p>

  <p>I officially promoted <a href="https://resheet.dev">ReSheet</a> from alpha to beta!</p>


  <p>ReSheet has undergone a lot of detailed work over the last two months that might not be noticeable unless you
    encountered specific issues that got improved.</p>


  <p>Noticable will be the improved starting document which makes it much clearer what ReSheet aims to achieve and how
    to use it. I added a demo, better documentation, and several examples. The examples aim to demonstrate what's
    possible with ReSheet and the potential I see in it. I think the "Examples &gt; Custom Blocks" and "Examples &gt;
    Interactive Game Dev" pages will be especially interesting to you.</p>


  <p>"Examples &gt; Custom Blocks" illustrates how to integrate almost any other (web/React) library/tool. I think
    there’s a lot of potential if we could integrate the various tools developed here. Since many are web-based, ReSheet
    could potentially serve as a framework to unify them. If anyone is interested in exploring this, please send me a
    message! 🙂</p>


  <p>"Examples &gt; Interactive Game Dev" showcases the possibilities for building custom Blocks in ReSheet. It uses
    built-in Blocks to create a simple interactive Game Editor, featuring live programming and displaying intermediate
    steps/results of the code.</p>

  <p>Had fun presenting my<a href="https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/lazer-cut-shell-joints"> lazer cutting box
      joint generator Observable notebook</a> at Germany FoC meetup. Feel free to DM me or leave a comment in the
    notebook if you want to chat more about it. I dunno how well I communicated the point, but my point is that you can
    solve harder problems if you can link representations. There is no representational hierarchy of best-ness, I am
    finding switching between representations is useful for getting the best of all worlds. The notebook contains some
    cool advanced observable hacks, like projecting the inbuilt "plot" data visualizer onto three.js surfaces, linking
    quantitive DataViz to a Spatial representation, both of which have different strengths.</p>

  <p>Currently only simple drawing on canvas is implemented - I plan to add basic symbol recognition next.</p>

  <p>In something like prolog, terms can be nested. So I can express the idea "Socrates believes that he is mortal" with
    <code>bel ieves(socrates, mortal(socrates)).</code> Are there any popular database types that make it easy to have
    relations of arbitrary arity as parameters of other relations, without unduly adding to the complexity of the
    schema? Preferably with ungrounded statements and open-world negation? Is there some obvious reason why not? Is
    there a computational complexity problem that arises in the real world? RDF allows triples to be referenced, I
    believe, but you are limited to arity 2, which seems needlessly limiting. Labeled graphs have arbitrary arity for
    non-entities, but entities are limited to two, and you usually can't refer to an edge. It seems... weird to me. Is
    it just that we don't really have the efficient reasoners over those kinds of expressions, so it hasn't been useful?

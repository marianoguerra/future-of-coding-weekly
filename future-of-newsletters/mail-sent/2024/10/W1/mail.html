  <p>I got excited about a client-side RAG thing working this week, but the most videoable thing I also got working was
    a sticky UI holder for Observable, which will be useful for hanging notebook extension upon.</p>

    are currently experimenting with no-code, local-first and malleable-software isms.</p>


  <p>We want to create a local environment where it is really easy for end-users and non-developers to build workflows
    and manage their own data, whilst also being able to plug into the services (apps and websites) that they currently
    use and build their own user-interfaces for those services. It's a big dream and we've started small.</p>


  <p>A few years ago during the pandemic we built a <a href="https://app.kendra.io/kendraio/coronavirus">dashboard for
      COVID-19 data</a>. Our Flow plugged into various APIs and then visualised the received data on one page – so a
    good demonstration of one aspect of our dream. The dashboard still exists but shows historical data. We wrote an <a
      href="https://medium.com/kendraio/covid-19-kendraio-creates-coronavirus-dashboard-within-kendraio-app-a0185e526b25">article</a>
    about the dashboard which also has an accompanying <a href="https://youtu.be/OD_SN99Sy8Q">video</a> explaining how
    it works and how you can edit the Flow while it's running.</p>


  <p>Enjoy! Look forward to any comments or questions. Cheers!</p>

  <p>My students and I have worked on three papers (two prototypes) that will be presented at <a

  <ul>
    <li>Christopher Esterhuyse -- <a href="https://ltvanbinsbergen.nl/files/papers/sle2024.pdf">Cooperative
        Specification via Composition Control </a>(SLE2024)</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>This paper investigates control mechanisms in declarative languages that can be used by a programmer to have
      guarantees about the written program even when it is extended by other programmers. The work is motivated by
      distributed systems governed by policies in which the actors that provide the policies may have been competing
      interests. Concretely, think about (data sharing) contracts that are embedded in a federated cloud infrastructure.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Damian Frölich -- <a href="https://ltvanbinsbergen.nl/files/papers/gpce2024.pdf">On the Soundness of
        Auto-completion Services for Dynamically Typed Languages </a>(GPCE2024)</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>This paper investigates the use of "abstract interpretation" to give sound auto-complete suggestions for dynamic
      languages and demonstrates the technique on a subset of Python. Here "sound" means: if you select a given
      candidate, the inserted code will not contain variables that turns out to be undefined when the code runs.</li>

  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>This paper demos a prototype that we built to investigate a modular graph structure for representing and running
      source code. The tool allows you to create different projections out of the code such as code structure,
      documentation view, and execution history. The tool supports incremental and exploratory programming and "nested
      graphs" (importing a graph as a node) for hierarchical views, although this is a more recent add-on.</li>

  <p>This debug UI has been surprisingly handy over the last few days. I'm able to visualize a parse tree even after
    it's been flattened, just using color transparency. All I'm doing is painting all the rects that contain the mouse
    cursor. Since the color is transparent, it doesn't matter what order they're in. (The larger rects actually come
    later; they're fall-backs if a more fine-grained rect isn't found.)</p>

  <p>Hey 👋 I was recently searching again how "usable" "AI" became. So I stumbled on this tool: <a
      href="https://pinokio.computer/">pinokio</a> . Its all just JSON. Before just evalutating the tool I might
    describe the criteria I would be interested in. Broadly speaking I would like to have tool similar to what we see in
    this clip: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGYFEI6uLy0">youtube.com/watch?v=HGYFEI6uLy0</a></p>


  <p>Consider The following more specific scenario:</p>


  <p>I have a PKM Zettelkasten and I have some friends. Now my workflow is to write and then to publish. I want to
    provide for them a Voice assistant that can summarize contents based on various parameters: By time e.g. topics of
    last 3 months, last week. But I also want to provide overviews on specific topics as well as interesting
    interconnections.</p>


  <p>Do you know of any tools that could help with creating such use cases?</p>

  <p>This is a very random thought - but something that I've been occasionally wondering for some time now. If we have
    lambda calculus as a model of functional languages and Turing machines as a model of imperative languages, what
    would be a good model for programming systems that have "document" as the basic underlying structure (Subtext is an
    example of this) - i.e., you have some tree structure and the program evaluates by modifying this document -
    appending new things or rewriting evaluated bits. (Lambda calculus itself is basically a tree, but what if this also
    allows imperative document edits?)</p>


  <p>Could this be something like a "Turing machine" that works on trees rather than tapes? There would be "current
    location" which can move in various ways around the tree and modify it. If your document has references (perhaps you
    can have <code>../../foo</code> to refer to <code>foo</code> of a parent of a parent), the machine would have to
    somehow walk up the tree, remembering that it wants to copy a value back to the original location - and then walk
    over the tree back to put the value in place of the reference).</p>


  <p>Is this something completely silly or something that lots of people have already done but under different names?

  <p>I've implemented the flip-flop object which concludes the "object library" that is necessary for basic macro
    playback. Automat can now play Super Mario Bros with only occasional desync issues 🙂</p>

  <p>🎲 I created a new programming game. It's called <em>2222.</em> (Pronounced "two twenty-two two")</p>


  <p>Well, I actually created a <em>meta</em> -game — because <em>you have to program the game yourself</em> , in any
    programming system you want. Then you get to play it.</p>


  <p>The code is incredibly simple. You can do it in 3 blocks of Scratch. It's what TodoMVC would be if it had a soul.
  </p>


  <p>It takes about 22 minutes to play. You will very likely burst out laughing while playing. When you finish the game,
    you will feel utterly bizarre. You can play the game by yourself, or in a group. Good luck, have fun.</p>


  <p>I would <em>love</em> to see your implementation, and/or (but especially <em>and</em> ) a video of you playing.</p>


  <p>How do you ~play~ program the game?</p>

  <p>Hello! I've been working on something in my spare time, very early stage... but I think it shows promise.</p>


  <p>Given that <a href="https://twitter.com/TodePond">Lu Wilson</a> encourages us to share scrappy fiddles, here it is.
  </p>


  <p>It's a visual stream processing system - based on tldraw for the UI and Pekko Streams (in Scala) for the backend.

  <p>I have been working on adding Keyboard / Gamepad only navigation for Schema Studio, the open-source integrated
    creative environment for light control, generative visuals and more based on vvvv gamma.</p>


  <p>The environment focuses on instant feedback, quick editing, using a fun (subjective :)) game like interface. It
    uses a Block based programming approach that tries to combine the best of text and visual editing interfaces.</p>


  <p>I am calling the feature "Cursor", and <a href="https://youtu.be/9Af2U28DgQk">here is a short demo.</a></p>

  <p>I've been slowly reading "The Nature of Order" by Christopher Alexander and slowly thinking about how to make my
    editor for text and line drawings more timeless. (And mostly sleeping a lot, if I'm honest.) Today the combination
    of the two led me to draw this shape for the line-wrapping algorithm.</p>


  <p>Until now I've been developing the editor the "usual" way, which for me consists of needing some computation,
    figuring out the most convenient place to perform the computation, then squirreling away the result somewhere it's
    available when needed. In an effort to get myself out of the rut of the inevitable problems of indirection and cache
    invalidation that result, I've been trying to replace all my <em>ad hoc</em> data structures with on-demand
    computation based on the base state of the program. And what I've been ending up with is umpteen variations of this
    pictured algorithm, just with different code stuck on to the protrusions.</p>


  <p>There may be an abstraction that comes out of all this, but I don't see it yet. And as CA says, a flower isn't made
    up of identical petals. Each one evolves uniquely as a part of the whole.</p>

  <p>Quick and dirty prototype of the above algo/shape/code using Vim syntax highlighting.</p>


  <p>The code in the screenshot is a function to convert a mouse click (mx, my) into the location (line_index, pos) of
    the character at that point on the screen.</p>


  <p>The problem is much of this function is boilerplate shared with several other places, such as the code to draw text
    on screen, compute the height of a wrapped line, etc. The boilerplate makes it difficult to see the business logic
    unique to this particular function, and so creates pressure to prematurely create an abstraction to "DRY things
    out". Highlighting the shape of the boilerplate in pink helps the eye to focus to the unique business logic in the
    protrusions, and so counters the pressure to hide the boilerplate before I've figured out the best way to do so.</p>

  <p>Some updates on my visual programming project codeflowcanvas this week: <a href="https://youtu.be/U8SB2hXBKs0">In
      this video</a> I show some work I did for the open-canvas working group (ocwg for short): if you go to <a
      href="http://demo.codeflowcanvas.io/ocwg">demo.codeflowcanvas.io/ocwg</a> you can see a window floating in the
    bottom right, this shows the current flow in the current ocwg draft spec.</p>


  <p>I've build the export mechanism using a strategy pattern so that I can also easily support other formats if needed
    (a basic export to tldraw is already one of them). I hope this helps in developing the new open canvas spec that the
    ocwg is working on via bi-weekly meetings and a github repo (see various links on <a
      href="https://www.canvasprotocol.org">canvasprotocol.org</a>).</p>


  <p>Lately I am focussing more on embedding and/or integrating codeflowcanvas with other tools and technologies so that
    it is not running in a silo of its own, and this feature helps with that I think.</p>


  <p>This week I also send in a submission to <a href="http://liveprog.org">liveprog.org</a>.</p>

  <p>It's now possible to delete objects. Ten months into Automat development may be late but it's better than never.
    Now I'm working on auto-connections when objects are nearby.</p>

  <p>I am trying to get my lazer cut box joint generator thing less like a notebook and more like an app. So I have
    pushed all my observable UI cells into a single cell with a custom layout overlaying a three.js visualisation.</p>


  <p>I wrote a new UI tool that allows the UI to be decomposed at runtime, so I can move the (live) ui visualisations to
    their appropriate place when needed.</p>

  <p>I wrote DendryScope, a static analysis tool for interactive fiction, quests, and dialogue in videogames. Given a
    story written in Dendry, the skein will generate all of the playtraces which match queries such as 'reached the good
    ending, did not find the thief's treasure, and offended the barkeep'. <a

  <p>do little things count? because i made a little thing. i'm not a big fan of using repls for messing around because
    i want to go back and redo things all the damn time. recently i caught myself opening a text editor and doing
    <code>~_*watch -n1 some-script*_~</code> in a separate window. </p>


  <p>so i went ahead and made a little (vim)script that does just that - it automatically reruns your code as you type.
  </p>


  <p>it's been pretty convenient for doing little bits of napkin math. </p>

  <p>For the past month I've been doing something very unnatural for myself: "throwing the first one away." Going back
    and rewriting an aspect of a working program just to improve one property of the <em>code</em> rather than the
    behavior: eliminating all derived data structures and re-deriving everything all the time in a performant way.</p>


  <p>The result is a simpler API that seems applicable to pixel-based editors that use proportional fonts. Basically the
    problem is: as you do line-wrapping on a screen, how do you deal with interactive operations like clicking at a
    pixel coordinate or pressing the down arrow (which might result in a scroll). These primitives seem to make the
    implementation fairly self-evident: <a

      #share-your-work@2024-05-22</a>- I am working on performance had had the nerdiest proud moment ever and figured of
    all people, ya'll would appreciate it.</p>


  <p>I built a propagation speed profiler in holograph to test how fast propagation was occurring for a little
    recursively incrementing loop (in the grey box). Im using a buffer to collect and average the values over time and
    another buffer to collect and display averages as a chart. You can see the propagation speed and compare it with the
    total Propagations Per Second (PPS in the top left). Before this work i was at a hard cap of 60 pps and now total
    pps often gets over 300. Still a long road ahead but it feels like a big win right now 🎉</p>


  <p>In any case, this example demonstrates major stuff added since my first post here:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Get and set shape properties</li>
    <li>Trigger click events</li>
    <li>Dashed arrows that don't fire propagators</li>
    <li>Async functions/fetch/await syntax</li>
    <li>Lots of cool examples to explore- including some made my folk here :)</li>

  <p>Hope ya'll enjoyed the update! If ya'll find anything wonky or have ideas let me know !</p>

  <p>Thought the format may better fit here</p>
  <blockquote style="margin-left:1em;color:#555555;font-style:italic">

    <p>[July 20th, 2024 10:22 PM] hi565: Thank you so much for your feedback &lt;@U0296ACR13M&gt;. It's really
      interesting to think about the strengths and weaknesses of these different paradigms.</p>


    <p>I would say that with any sufficiently complex application, it comes down to what tooling is available and
      whether the codebase has consistent standards. I spend much of my day job in more standard code, in complex
      distributed codebases.</p>


    <p>It's invaluable to be able to use an IDE, navigate through definitions, search across the full codebase, seamless
      debugging and lately even having the ability to analyze and explain larger parts of the codebase with AI in tools
      such as Cursor. This all can help understand new code. Using common or at least consistent patterns, good naming
      and all that stuff will make it easier. It can still involve learning new paradigms, libraries and so on.</p>


    <p>I would say that a lot of the same applies to working in node based environments. With the added complexity of
      usually having to lay out things yourself, which can absolutely make or break readability - whereas formatters are
      absolutely standard for text code nowadays. Also, given the lack of standardization in node based tools (yes, it's
      often nodes, but with so many flavors), each language requires its own IDE, putting a lot of strain on developers
      to match the mature tooling for text code.</p>


    <p>Still, I find that some types of flows, especially data piping, and some types of use-cases, such as realtime
      multimedia applications, generally work better for me in visual environments. vvvv gamma (<a
        href="https://visualprogramming.net/">https://visualprogramming.net/</a>), which all of Schema is created with,
      seems to be the closest to a full featured IDE I've come across in visual programming. I've also found that
      Reactive programming is incredibly intuitive in this environment, compared to C# for instance. Though it still has
      some way to go, such as improved tooling for git or multiwindow.</p>


    <p>During development I've certainly had moments where the realtime code update and amazing protocol abstractions
      made it a joy, while there were others where the tooling and constant tidying needed made me wish for more
      standard lands.</p>


    <p>Going back to the original point with complexity, In Schema, while theoretically possible, I do not encourage
      there to be a huge amount of complexity at the same time. First of all, there is a big focus on fairly high level
      nodes aimed mainly at animation and a good amount of things happening implicitly, such as referencing extents of
      objects in space. Of course, all this interconnected machinery is its own complexity, even when there may be less
      "code" to see at a time.</p>


    <p>Secondly, there are a number of ways of switching up parts of the stacks using assigning via Director, layers,
      groupings, referencing other objects and modifying slightly. With the general idea that you can get a lot of
      variety by combining and switching around small-ish stacks of blocks.</p>


    <p>Additionally, when you look at a Block based code, which may seem visual, it's actually no more than nested
      functions, not far from Lisp or any code AST in general.</p>


    <p>Blockly, for instance, is often used to build out regular text code. Though I agree drag and dropping everything
      is a pretty obnoxious way if you know your way around code.</p>


    <p>As a matter of fact, all of Schema Block stacks can actually be represented as a very succinct YAML (<a
        href="https://docs.scenic.tools/future-concepts/scenicscript">https://docs.scenic.tools/future-concepts/scenicscript</a>),
      which allows for a human readable transfer format, text editing (helpful on terminal devices also), LLM
      completions and more.</p>


    <p>What the UI in Schema helps with is interfacing with the parameters and providing immediate in-place feedback of
      the individual data processing steps (similar to TouchDesigner which does this very well). It also providing
      domain specific overlays such as MIDI mapping or DMX channel output visualization.</p>


    <p>Overall I am trying to strike a balance between the two worlds while finding new ways to interact with code.</p>


    <p>This new Cursor work aims to make the block programming feel as efficient, if not more than, writing textual
      code, while also making it more accessible and fun with the goal of enabling full game controller support.</p>


    <p>I really appreciate that you find some of these approaches novel :heart:</p>

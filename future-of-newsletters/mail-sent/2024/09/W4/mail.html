  <p>In this <a href="https://youtu.be/sSrvrYvAbss">video</a> I show a new feature that I am working on in my
    codeflowcanvas project (which is a visual programming system and language): exporting a flow to typescript so that
    it can be used in other code-bases. In this example it's a nodejs-hono project for creating an api with a
    swagger/openapi documentation page</p>

  <p>Hello! I just listened to the AgentSheets episode and wanted to share that I’m working on a PBE + block programming
    educational tool. It’s a work in progress but the vision is of something like “a macro recorder for Kid Pix” that
    lets you switch between drawing and code editing. <a
      href="https://motifdesigner.netlify.app/">motifdesigner.netlify.app</a> Target audience is elementary school age
    kids, though it’s also meant to be fun for adults to tinker with.</p>


  <p>I’m excited that there seems to be a bit more traction (or at least interest?) around PBE again. I thought it was
    an interesting point in the paper/episode that it hasn’t necessarily gone out of fashion because it wasn’t a good
    idea, but because other solutions emerged to some of the problems it was trying to solve.</p>

  <p>... Chipping away at articles regarding a bunch of experiments towards creating higher level syntax for programming
    languages. Thus far, I've managed to consolidate t2t (text-to-text transpilation) into a single .mjs file and to
    redocument it. Wrote an adjunct article about experimenting with "t2t" using a toy meta-programming language to
    generate code in existing languages. "T2T creates DSLs. T2T reduces the amount of work required to build a DSL. You
    should be able to create a new DSL in an afternoon. ..."</p>

  <p>Very initial draft of a notebook UI.</p>


  <p>There are 2 kinds of lines here:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Regular lines are prose, but you can also insert named blanks into them using the syntax
      <code>[value|name]</code> , which renders vertically across 2 lines. You can't nest blanks within blanks. These
      lines can wrap, but a single blank can't wrap across multiple lines on screen.</li>
    <li>Indented lines (though the indentation is currently subtle) are code. They can render fractions using the syntax
      <code>(a/b)</code> as I showed before. (Not sure I'll keep this in the long term.) You can nest fractions within
      fractions. These lines don't support wrapping.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Planned:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>synchronizing blanks with the same name</li>
    <li>using code in indented lines to compute derived names without values inline.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Today I've added some rudimentary styling syntax to my notebook.</p>


  <p>It looks like I care about always making the styling very transparent, so it's possible in principle to guess what
    characters one needs to type to copy the look of something one sees on screen. So the style directives will never be
    hidden.</p>

  <p>There's a bug in my parser. Here's a debug UI showing it at a glance. The parse tree in the background is for the
    line the mouse pointer is hovering on.</p>


  <p>One fun thing is the couple of lines in the middle there. I reached for a notebook to scribble some equations for
    myself, but then realized all I wanted was to be able to draw the fraction line horizontally -- and I'm sitting in a
    tool that can do that. Using the tool to debug the tool 💥 (At least until I have no tools because I broke my tools
    using my tools. <a

  <p>I like this metaphor of translucent software both as a callback to the translucent hardware aesthetic of the 2000s,
    but also to progressively display the underlying mechanisms of software ~<em><em>if</em></em>~ you want to see it.

  <p>A fascinating <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1992/0065.html">1992 mailing list post from
      Tim Berners-Lee</a> where he briefly outlines his desires for a programming language for the web — basically, what
    JavaScript could have been.</p>


  <p>The principles of hypertext are on full display:</p>
  <blockquote style="margin-left:1em;color:#555555;font-style:italic">

    <p>You need something really powerful, but at the same time ubiquitous. Remember a facet of the web is universal
      readership.</p>
  </blockquote>


  <p>Then there's the PL nerdery:</p>
  <blockquote style="margin-left:1em;color:#555555;font-style:italic">

    <p>Ideally, the language should include object-oriented inheritance, a basically functional nature, and a clean
      syntax. It should be interpretable and compilable. At least one public domain. A pre-compiled standard binary form
      would be cool too.</p>
  </blockquote>


  <p>My favourite bit, though, is the desire for the client/server to negotiate over the language of the executable
    document, just like they negotiate other details. There are some wild <em>isomorphism</em> implications here.</p>
  <blockquote style="margin-left:1em;color:#555555;font-style:italic">

    <p>In reality, what we would be able to offer you real soon now with document format negotiation is the ability to
      return a document in some language for execution, with the option of being able to provide it in several
      languages, the language being a "data format" which can be negotiated between client and server at run-time. For,
      for example, one could provide it in viola script and/or in /bin/sh which would cover most ofthe unix world.</p>

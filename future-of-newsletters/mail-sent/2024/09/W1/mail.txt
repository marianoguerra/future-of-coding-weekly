Trying to make Duplo more interesting... So far it is working (probably), seem to have encouraged my daughter to learn to stack two pieces together! 😃



Actually the next step after a fanfare is probably (not the stars but) to have pieces make different sounds and/or beats depending on sensors (ex sensing colors, stacking, proximity or sound) — a music machine. Perhaps more important: a programmer base plate; where you stack pieces & program them (from ex Arduino studio, for now). Inter-piece communication could also be interesting? Ideas?

# Our Work

🎙️ [Future of Coding 73 • Moving Beyond Syntax: Lessons from 20 Years of Blocks Programming in AgentSheets by Alexander Repenning](https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/073) via [Ivan Reese](http://ivanish.ca/)

Finally, a title with appropriate length given the duration and depth of its episode. May it swiftly be surpassed.



[Alexander Repenning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Repenning) created [AgentSheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AgentSheets), an environment to help kids develop computational thinking skills. It wrapped an unusual computational model with an even more unusual user interface. The result was divisive. It inspired so many other projects, whilst being rejected at every turn and failing to catch on the way Scratch later did. So in 2017, Repenning published this obit of a paper, [Moving Beyond Syntax: Lessons from 20 Years of Blocks Programming in AgentSheets](https://agentsheets.com/img/educators/20YearsofBlockProgramingLessonsLearned_published.pdf), which covers his findings over the years as AgentSheets evolved and transformed, and gives perspective on block-based programming, programming-by-example, agents / rule / rewrite systems, automata, and more.



This is probably the most “normal” episode we’ve done in a while — we stay close to the text and un-clam many a thought-tickling pearl. I’m saying that sincerely now to throw you off our scent the next time we get totally lost in the weeds. I hear a clock ticking.

LLMs are forcing me to think about non-deterministic yet rational "computation".



Agents are beyond what traditionally computation has been. When an agent starts performing a task, and the environment changes, they need to find the balance between too much rethinking (classical decision theory) and not enough rethinking (computation).

I just had a thought.



Is anyone aware of any work on a non-programmer-friendly UI for editing pattern matching? Semantically, I’m looking for Datalog. So I guess a Datalog query UI, although I could imagine a pattern matching UI being developed outside of a use with Datalog.

I’m trying to figure out why you ([Ivan Reese](http://ivanish.ca/)) think that using OhmJS to produce the wiki would create a dependency, while I ([Paul Tarvydas](https://guitarvydas.github.io/2021/09/23/Manifesto.html)) don’t think so.  Here’s a diagram of how I understand the situation...

I've been thinking about how neurosymbolic AI might be achieved. The first problem is that of memory/knowledge. Triple stores are often recommended. But I am failing to see how triples are THE definitive choice for knowledge representation.



The classic example would be: How to store the fact "Bob's age is 23yrs". This maps to the Entity-Attribute-Value or Subject-Predicate-Object pattern and the triple  `(Bob, age, 23yrs)`  works.



But on one hand, even a 2-store can be used:




```
(Bob, Bob's age)

(Bob's age, 23yrs)
```



This has more layers of indirections, yes. But the primitives become simpler.

On the other hand, if the fact was "Bob bought this camera in Singapore for 100$", the same layers of indirections show up in triple stores as well.



Arbitrary knowledge seems multidimensional (time, place, context etc etc). Is there a reason to believe that triple stores achieve the best tradeoff between simplicity and expressivity?

[🧵 conversation](https://history.futureofcoding.org/history/weekly/2024/09/W1/thinking-together.html#2024-09-01T03:17:16.476Z)

Does anyone have thoughts about equality vs ordering in maps/sets?



I have some pondering here - [scattered-thoughts.net/log/0048/#zest-ordering](https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/log/0048/#zest-ordering) but the decision tree at the end is the main thing:






* Order isn't observable at all.
* Iteration order is either non-deterministic or expensive.
* Determism can be manually recovered by storing both a map and a list of keys, but at the cost of storing two copies of each key.
* Order is observable.
* Order doesn't affect equality.


* Equality is not extensional ie  `a == b`  does not imply that  `f(a) == f(b)` .
* If  `[a: 0, b: 1] == [b: 1, a: 0]`  then we must have  `struct[a: i64, b: i64] == struct[b: i64, a: i64]` , but we still have to remember that the field order is different, which implies that type equality can't rely on interning and pointer comparison.


* Order affects equality.


* Sets become surprising / less useful.
* If I want to add query planning, I can't promise that  `f(db) == optimize-query(f)(db)` .

I had no idea [Jonathan Edwards](https://twitter.com/jonathoda/)'s landmark Subtext is almost 20 years old.



[Subtext 1](https://vimeo.com/451278506) (2005) is still hugely compelling. I hadn't watched this until today. If you're like me, you're in for a treat.

Here's the recording of the [Future of Coding Virtual Meetup 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0DDj3OBWdc). We saw a textual projectional editor from **@Jarno Montonen**, an Observable-based exploration of visualizations from [Tom Larkworthy](https://webcode.run), and I shared an update on the FoC Wiki.



Next month, rather than demos, we're going to host a little event where we all get together on a call and write wiki articles. Should be fun, likely chaotic. See you there!

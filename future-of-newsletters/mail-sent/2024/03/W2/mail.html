  <p><a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/070">Future of Coding 70 • Beyond Efficiency</a> by <strong>@Dave
      Ackley</strong></p>


  <p>Dave Ackley’s paper Beyond Efficiency is three pages long. With just these three pages, he mounts a compelling
    argument against the conventional way we engineer software. Instead of inflexibly insisting upon correctness, maybe
    allow a lil slop? Instead of chasing peak performance with cache and clever tricks, maybe measure many times before
    you cut. So in this episode, we’re putting every CEO in the guillotine… (oh, that stands for “correctness and
    efficiency only”, don’t put us on a list)… and considering when, where, and how to do the robust thing.</p>

  <p>sharing some recent thoughts I have had about verifying LLM-generated bugfixes automatically with cloud
    infrastructure: <a href="https://lfdepombo.com/cloudbugfix">lfdepombo.com/cloudbugfix</a>. Today we validate
    LLM-generated code by looking at it or manually running it within our codebase. However if the expected behavior of
    the code is verifiable, there is a less painful workflow where the mistakes made by the LLM are not visible to us.

  <p>Alrighty, here's the post I mentioned I'd make in <strong>#introduce-yourself</strong>:</p>


  <p>I want to create a computing ecosystem that solves most of the problems in what I call 'unregulated I/O'.</p>


  <p>It is quite possibly mad. Or it might work, and I will be surprised.</p>


  <p>It takes design cues from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_(operating_system)">Oberon</a>, <a
      href="https://github.com/google/flatbuffers">FlatBuffers</a>, <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a>, <a
      href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.</p>


  <p>It also sounds dangerously close to the kind of "great idea" a compsci undergrad would come out with. Yet, I am
    running out of reasons why this isn't possible (at the very least). This is why I want your opinions 😅</p>


  <p>That's all I'll say here - rest is in the 🧵</p>

  <p>If you’ve wondered:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>why the only copilot we have is for VSCode</li>
    <li>why not every app is end-user programmable</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I wondered the same thing, and I’ve built (<a href="https://omnipilot.ai">omnipilot.ai</a>), an AI copilot that
    works everywhere on macOS.</p>


  <p>Specifically it lets you invoke GPT to type into any app ( <em>particularly interesting to me is it works great in
      Xcode</em> ), can also autocomplete text in any app, and lets you chat with GPT-4 with context from your recent
    apps. I’d really appreciate any feedback or first impressions!</p>


  <p>Re end-user programmability I’m also working on making it more possible for people to make little “automations” on
    their computer, whether it’s adding buttons to Finder to convert files or recording little AI-enhanced macros.</p>


  <p>Some specific questions I’d love feedback:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How often do you find yourself wanting help editing code outside of a Github Copilot-enabled environment? What
      are those situations or apps?</li>
    <li>What about text, do you wish you had a copilot for text too?</li>
    <li>What do you think of the “works everywhere” approach vs. a dedicated app?</li>
    <li>Do the AI-macros sound appealing or meh?</li>
    <li>Any thoughts on the landing page copy/design?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I’m also happy to answer any other questions. Thanks in advance for sharing your thoughts, it’s super helpful in
    shaping the product!</p>

  <p>The kids and I had a blast playing Baba is You this morning, and it brought up ancient memories of playing Sokoban
    puzzles (where all you can do push crates around; in particular no pulling). Now I want to play Sokoban on my phone.

  <p>Re "beyond efficiency" podcast episode... I remember reading many years ago about this idea, maybe in Scientific
    American... Basically, evolved systems tend to be inefficient and full of redundancy, whereas designed systems are
    efficient and parsimonious... But many evolved systems can still function when many components are damaged</p>

  <p>Software products are physical products. That's why they're hard to design and engineer!</p>


  <p>The physicality of software is kept at arms-length in a vector-based design tool. Here, the strength and focus is
    on surface level aesthetics and exploration though mocks — many, many mocks. All needed. All useful. But a mock does
    not a product make. A mock is an incomplete story of software physics. Which brings us the other side of the
    spectrum...</p>


  <p>The IDEs — the code editors. The product you ship is here, so "I guess someone has to go there". First challenge:
    To most people it's walls of inexplicable symbols and weird (even hostile?) punctuation. Then, with code, you're
    essentially play-acting as a computer. You have to "speak computer" fluently to feel at home here. It's a love/hate
    relationship of running programs in your head. Mostly failing to do so. Then learning to get better at debugging.
    Eureka moments of finally solving the puzzle that unlocks a bugfix! Endlessly restarting programs to reset state.
    Today, even after multiple decades of investment in IDEs, coding is still 100 times harder and less fun than it
    should be! How can we truly move the needle?</p>


  <p>A traditional IDE deals with the how to fully describe the physics of a software system. Writing and editing
    algorithms. Managing data flows. Figuring out logic. Painting pixels. Sending data at the speed of light over the
    network. But the IDE doesn't actually let you <em>see</em> the program as it manifests to the user in the final
    medium. It's running somewhere else — the browser, on your phone. This is where vector-tools have the IDEs at least
    partially beat. Yes, they're just mocks, but the vector-tool tool <em>sees</em> the mocks alongside you. This
    changes your relationship with the tool. Thinking and touching — moving, dragging, scaling, rotating, duplicating —
    seamlessly blends on a canvas, and it just <em>feels</em> <em>good, even fun!</em> IDEs and editing code as text
    offers none of those things with today's tools, and it just feels like... friction!</p>


  <p>So the letter to Santa reads as follows:</p>


  <p> <em>Dear Santa, give me the best parts of a vector-based design tool, plus the best parts of an IDE, rolled into
      one — but with none of the downsides. Thanks!</em> </p>


  <p>Christmas can't get here fast enough.</p>

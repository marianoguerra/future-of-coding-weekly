But turns out I know enough people who have connections to it, and bumped into even more people I know when I visited yesterday. Fascinating.\n\nI only had an hour, but already had my mind blown several times, so it’ll take me a while — and another visit — to make up my mind and tell you more about it here.\n\nI’d love to share more info on what the rules are around visiting, but I couldn’t yet speak to somebody official enough about it. There were lots of “volunteers” last night. Apparently, they are trying something they call “community hours”, but it doesn’t appear to be official just yet. I will report as soon as I learn more.",

                "text": "A Petri net, also known as a place\/transition (PT) net, is one of several mathematical modeling languages for the description of distributed systems. It is a class of discrete event dynamic system. A Petri net is a directed bipartite graph, in which the nodes represent transitions (i.e. events that may occur, represented by bars) and places (i.e. conditions, represented by circles). The directed arcs describe which places are pre- and\/or postconditions for which transitions (signified by arrows). Some sources state that Petri nets were invented in August 1939 by Carl Adam Petri—at the age of 13—for the purpose of describing chemical processes.\nLike industry standards such as UML activity diagrams, Business Process Model and Notation and EPCs, Petri nets offer a graphical notation for stepwise processes that include choice, iteration, and concurrent execution. Unlike these standards, Petri nets have an exact mathematical definition of their execution semantics, with a well-developed mathematical theory for process analysis.",

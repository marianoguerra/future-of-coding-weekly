What distinguishes a productive developer from a not so productive one?\n- Before you can write code, you need to think about it. What does your thinking process look like and which techniques and tools do you use before typing code into an editor?\n- What was the most effective change you ever made to your process that increased your productivity as programmer?\n- Have you ever used a tool for something different than it was meant for? What was the tool, and what did you use it for?\n- What's the biggest productivity trap you fell into, or see others fall into frequently, and how do you prevent yourself from making that mistake?\n\nComplexity\n- What's the biggest source for complexity in your day to day work?\n- How do know that something is too complex and needs to be made simpler?\n- Which techniques do you use to make something simpler?\n- What changes, when you are getting better at managing complexity?\n- Imagine you’re building a new project from scratch and you can design the technical architecture without any constraints. Which techniques, patterns and frameworks do you rely on to keep things simple or at least manageable?\n- What's the most controversial or unorthodox tip you ever heard about dealing with complexity? Does it work?\n- What's one thing in software development you wish to be simpler?\n\nResources\n- What is the link (to an article, book, paper, or video) that you send most often to others and why do you share it? (Feel free to list several, if you have more than one.)\n- Which person do you follow passionately on the Internet and read and watch everything they create and share? (Feel free to list several, if you have more than one.)\n\nMultiply\n- Which question should I have asked, but didn’t, and would you like to read about in future interviews?\n- Who else should I ask all these questions next?\n- How can people find you on the internet? Which URLs do you want to share? (Website, GitHub, Twitter, Instagram, etc.)",

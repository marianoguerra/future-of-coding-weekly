Now I’m thinking about doing a series with all kinds of software developers about productivity and complexity in software development. I believe these are two highly important areas of focus to figure out what software development should be like in the future.\n\nI don’t think the interviews will be as long as the game developer ones, ideally more like a 5-10 min read.\n\nI’d love your input on this!\n\n1. What do you think about this? Does that sound interesting at all? Would you read interviews like that?\n2. What questions would you like me to ask? What would you like to read about that broadly fits the productivity and complexity theme?\n\nI have a set of 15 questions ready, which I’m happy to share here, but I’ll leave them out for now, just to not frame the discussion upfront and shut out potentially interesting ideas that wouldn’t come up otherwise.\n\nWould also love to interview some of you. Let me know if you’re interested in writing responses to a set of questions about productivity and complexity in programming.\n\nMy plan is to publish them as part of my (hopefully for real this time) upcoming blog about the same topics.",

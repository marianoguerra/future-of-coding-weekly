There are no tape readers for that format any more. For my DDS backup tapes, readers probably still exist somewhere, but I don”t have access to them. And my Apple Keynote files from 2006 are unreadable with today’s Keynote. It tells me to convert them using Keynote ‘09 - which is no longer available.\nI have moved all my important data to non-proprietary formats over the last years. That’s no guarantee for preservation, but chances are much better."

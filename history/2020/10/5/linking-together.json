An example from physics education is the old but ongoing debate on how to teach quantum mechanics: in terms of concrete representations (wave functions) or in terms of abstract representations in Hilbert spaces. It really depends on the prior knowledge/experience of the students, and that's something a teacher can't even know before the start of the course.\nSo I think that programming and its teaching can learn a lot from maths in this respect.",

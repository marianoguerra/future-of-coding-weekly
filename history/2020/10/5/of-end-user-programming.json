Open tech was driven by an innate urge to break free from corporate bullshit and to empower the community.\n\nSo what is available as part of some equivalent movement for non-techies, that empowers them and frees them from the Big Corps (and Big Govs)?\n\nWell, we have blockchains, IPFS, LBRY, Bittorrent, etc: these offer the promise to non-techies that they don't have to worry about censorship, taxes, copyright, surveillance, etc.. :smile:\n\nAnd we have classic EUP such as spreadsheets: no-one has to ask the Corporate Blob for approval to play with data and write some simple processing. And anything that enables user configuration, customisation, etc.\n\nSo that's where I'm at with my fundamental drivers for my work.\n\nI was wondering if this resonates with anyone else here?",

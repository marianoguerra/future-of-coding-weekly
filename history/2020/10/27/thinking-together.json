This has been in the context of working for a charitable community aiming to create ‘social spaces for social change’, with my role being to guide the creation of online spaces to complement physical spaces and activities.\n\nI’ve just now enjoyed watching the introductory video from the publicly available webinar (<https:\/\/www.buildingbeauty.org\/nature-of-order-lecture-series>) and was happy to see how much of the conversation centred on the interaction of ‘wholeness’ in what we build and ‘wholeness’ in ourselves and our social relations, given that this seems to me the deepest meaning his theory has, which can then be applied to specific fields such as architecture or software.\n\nIn my own work, trying to enable people to have as much agency in the creation of online spaces as they would with physical spaces, this led me on a long journey, culminating over the past couple of years in (rather accidentally) creating a programming language (<https:\/\/maraca-lang.org\/>). Having now spent some time with this language, I would loosely describe it as a language for defining living\/dynamic structure (the motivating example being a dynamic web page\/app), in a way that feels at some level a little like sculpting clay, or other similar ‘unfolding’ acts of creation.\n\nSimilar it seems to Alexander and architecture, I haven’t found it easy to align with the general world of IT\/tech, meaning much of this has been rather solo work, and can be challenging to articulate, so I’m looking forward to discussing these themes with others :slightly_smiling_face:",

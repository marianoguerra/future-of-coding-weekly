What I said before is, my stuff is also based on .NET, and due to my area of research (see <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Eqm2Eip884E> and <http:\/\/ecsharp.net|ecsharp.net> and <http:\/\/core.loyc.net|core.loyc.net>) I am curious what you use as a serialization format for vvvv \"source code\". Can you output the vvvv program as C# code, or as an assembly DLL that can be consumed by C#\/VB programs?",

                "text": "I recently re-read the &ldquo;Out of the Tar Pit&rdquo; paper by Ben Moseley and Peter Marks for a Papers We Love session at work. It is a pretty famous paper. You can find it at the Papers We Love repository at GitHub for the simple reason that lots of people love it. Reading the paper again triggered some thoughts, hence this blog post.\nThe title of the paper is taken from Alan Perlis (epigram #54):\n\nBeware of the Turing tar-pit in which everything is possible but nothing of interest is easy.\nA Turing tar-pit is a language or system that is Turing complete (and so can do as much as any language or system can do) yet is cumbersome and impractical to use. The Turing machine itself is a Turing tar-pit, because you probably wouldn&rsquo;t use it at work to solve real problems. It might be amusing but not practical.\nThe implication of the title is that we are currently in a Turing tar-pit, and we need to take measures to get out of it. Specifically, the measures outlined in the paper.\nThe paper consists of two parts. The first part is an essay about the causes and effects of complexity in software. The second part is a proposed programming model to minimize so-called accidental complexity in software.\nThe argument of the paper goes like this: Complexity is the primary cause of problems in software development. Complexity is problematic because it hinders the understanding of software systems. This leads to all kinds of bad second-order effects including unreliability, security issues, late delivery and poor performance, and &ndash; in a vicious circle &ndash; compound complexity, making all the problems worse in a non-linear fashion as systems grow larger.\nFollowing Fred Brooks in &ldquo;No Silver Bullet&ldquo;, the authors distinguish between essential and accidental complexity. The authors define &ldquo;essential complexity&rdquo; as the complexity inherent in the problem seen by the users. The &ldquo;accidental complexity&rdquo; is all the rest, including everything that has to do with the mundane, practical aspects of computing.\nThe authors identify state handling, control flow and code volume as drivers of complexity. Most of this complexity is labeled &ldquo;accidental&rdquo;, since it has to do with the physical reality of the machine, not with the user&rsquo;s problem.\nThe proposed fix is to turn the user&rsquo;s informal problem statement into a formal one: to derive an executable specification. Beyond that, we should only allow for the minimal addition of &ldquo;accidental&rdquo; complexity as needed for practical efficiency concerns.\nThe authors find our current programming models inadequate because they incur too much accidental complexity. Hence a new programming model is needed, one that incurs a minimum of accidental complexity. The second part of the paper presents such a model.\nWhat struck me as I was reading the paper again was that it is wrong about the causes of complexity and naive about software development in general.\nThe paper is wrong for two reasons. First, because it treats software development as an implementation problem. It would be nice if that were true. It&rsquo;s not. We will not get much better at software development if we keep thinking that it is. Second, because it ignores the dynamics of software development and makes invalid assumptions. Specifically, it is naive about the nature of the problems we address by making software.\nI agree with the authors that complexity is a tremendous problem in software. The non-linear cumulation of complexity often threatens to make non-trivial software development efforts grind to a halt. Many software systems are not just riddled with technical debt which is the term we often use for runaway complexity &ndash; they have practically gone bankrupt! However, the problem of complexity cannot be solved by means of a better programming model alone. We must trace the causes of complexity beyond the realm of the machine and into the real world. While better programming models would be nice, we can&rsquo;t expect wonders from them. The reason is that the root cause of complexity is to be found in the strenuous relationship between the software system and the world in which it operates. This is outside the realm of programming models.\nAccording to the authors, the role of a software development team is &ldquo;to produce (using some given language and infrastructure) and maintain a software system which serves the purposes of its users&rdquo;. In other words, the role is to implement the software. The role of the user, on the other hand, is to act as oracle with respect to the problem that needs to be solved. The authors note in parenthesis that they are assuming &ldquo;that the users do in fact know and understand the problem that they want solved&rdquo;. Yet it is well-known that this assumption doesn&rsquo;t hold! Ask anyone in software! Already we&rsquo;re in trouble. How can we create an executable specification without a source for this knowledge and understanding?\nThe paper&rsquo;s analysis of the causes of complexity begins like this:\nIn any non-trivial system there is some complexity inherent in the problem that needs to be solved.\nSo clearly the problem is important. But what is it? In fact, let&rsquo;s pull the sentence &ldquo;the problem that needs to be solved&rdquo; apart a bit, by asking some questions.\nWhere did the problem come from? Who defined the problem? How is the problem articulated and communicated, by whom, to whom? Is there agreement on what the problem is? How many interpretations and formulations of the problem are there? Why this problem and not some other problem? Who are affected by this problem? Who has an interest in it?  Who owns it? Why does the problem matter? Who determined that it was a problem worth solving? Why does it need to be solved? How badly does it need to be solved? Is time relevant? Has it always been a problem? How long has this problem or similar problems existed? Could it cease to be a problem? What happens if it isn&rsquo;t solved? Is a partial solution viable? How does the problem relate to other problems, or to solutions to other problems? How often does the problem change? What does it mean for the problem to change? Will it still need solving? What forces in the real world could potentially lead to changes? How radical can we expect such changes to be?\nWe quickly see that the problem isn&rsquo;t the solution, the problem is the problem itself! How can we even begin to have illusions about how to best develop a &ldquo;solution&rdquo; to our &ldquo;problem&rdquo; without answers to at least some of these questions? The curse of software development is that we can never fully answer all of these questions, yet they are crucial to our enterprise! If we are to look for root causes of complexity in software, we must start by addressing questions such as these.\nWhen we treat the problem definition as somehow outside the scope of the software development effort, we set ourselves up for nasty surprises &ndash; and rampant complexity. As Gerald Weinberg put it in &ldquo;Are Your Lights On?&ldquo;: &ldquo;The computer field is a mother lode of problem definition lessons.&rdquo; Indeed, any ambiguity, misunderstandings, conflicts, conflict avoidance etc with respect to what the problem is will naturally come back to haunt us in the form of complexity when we try to implement a solution.\nConsider an example of actual software development by an actual organization in an actual domain: the TV streaming service offered by NRK, the national public broadcaster in Norway. It&rsquo;s where I work. What is the problem? It depends on who you ask. Who should you ask? I happen to be nearby. If you ask me, one of many developers working on the service, I might say something like &ldquo;to provide a popular, high-quality, diverse TV streaming service for the Norwegian public&rdquo;. It is immediately clear that providing such a service is not a purely techni…",

With ambiguous systems based on natural language programming, there is a new source of complexity: for some task it can be tricky to find\/guess the sentence that will make the compiler produce the behavior that you want. And maybe one compiler will \"choose\" one behavior that will be different than the one chosen by an other compiler.

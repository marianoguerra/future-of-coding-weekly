        "text": "There's been a lot of activity over the past few years in defining high level GPU languages that address these issues.\n• co-dfns is a data-parallel and functional dialect of APL that runs on GPUs. What blew my mind is that the compiler itself is written in co-dfns, and so you can compile your co-dfns programs into GPU code using the GPU. Prior to seeing this, I did not think that a compiler was the kind of program suitable for parallel execution on a GPU. Turns out that the choice of data structures is very important.\n• Taichi is a DSL for defining fixed-height hierarchical data structures (which behave like sparse arrays). Thousands of lines of CUDA that only one guy in your organization understands can be replaced by tens of lines of taichi code. It's very instructive to look at the GPU-specific data types and compiler optimizations exposed by the Taichi language.\n• TensorFlow is implemented as a library that you call from C++ or Python. Using this library, you construct what is essentially a parse tree for a program using APL-like data parallel operations. The library compiles this parse tree into GPU code and executes it. Stefan asked why this is a language issue, not a library issue. Well, it's easier to write code directly in a language, than to use a library interface that consumes source code written in another language and compiles it.",

What blew my mind is that the compiler itself is written in co-dfns, and so you can compile your co-dfns programs into GPU code using the GPU. Prior to seeing this, I did not think that a compiler was the kind of program suitable for parallel execution on a GPU. Turns out that the choice of data structures is very important."

Well, it's easier to write code directly in a language, than to use a library interface that consumes source code written in another language and compiles it."

Dijkstra's paper makes a reasonable case, but on balance may have actually done more harm than good with the flood of imitators and style guides seeking to ban language features purely out of fear. Many of the imitators even copied the 'considered harmful' phrasing, as an offering to be taken more seriously by the masses.\n\nThen again, maybe I'm being unfair. Ever were humans prone to following rules without understanding why they exist. If it wasn't Dijkstra we'd find someone else to imitate.\n\nHere's a little case I made for goto a few years ago: "

We should then be able to submit those programs to a compiler or archivist labeled, of course, using colored tabs."

I've made some small video games before, and I never decided to use a CPU because a GPU _wouldn't work._ It's more that CPUs are the default choice.\nOn the other hand, I can see how an SQL database would be a problem on the GPU since you have to shuffle a ton of data around and disk\/memory speed would limit any potential gains. I'm not personally interested in \"big data\" apps thankfully, so I'm happy to presume my language only works with &lt;~2 GB workloads.\nAnd yeah, I think \"the future\" is integration of CPU and GPU cores such that there is no perceivable communication overhead. It might be reasonable to take that as an assumption, if helpful.",

                "text": "Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) is a cross-vendor set of specifications that allow for the integration of central processing units and graphics processors on the same bus, with shared memory and tasks. The HSA is being developed by the HSA Foundation, which includes (among many others) AMD and ARM. The platform's stated aim is to reduce communication latency between CPUs, GPUs and other compute devices, and make these various devices more compatible from a programmer's perspective, relieving the programmer of the task of planning the moving of data between devices' disjoint memories (as must currently be done with OpenCL or CUDA).CUDA and OpenCL as well as most other fairly advanced programming languages can use HSA to increase their execution performance.  Heterogeneous computing is widely used in system-on-chip devices such as tablets, smartphones, other mobile devices, and video game consoles. HSA allows programs to use the graphics processor for floating point calculations without separate memory or scheduling.",

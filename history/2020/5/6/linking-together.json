You don't need an encyclopedia entry to contain every possible detail in order for it to usefully convey critical info. So we need some other solution than just \"make sure everyone is fully stats-literate and give them all the data and formulas\". That doesn't scale.\nYes, care must be taken to reveal only the level of information (here formulas) that is useful at the level reading. But maybe there is way to do it progressively? At least easier than the code for the Nicky Case article, where the formulas are in the JavaScript code mixed with UI parts. Maybe first the graph, then the parameters, then high level formulas, then lower level formulas, with as much level as needed down to the approximations the \"last\" formulas are doing and explicitly stating that they are abstractions and what this means in the reading of the whole story.",

Maybe first the graph, then the parameters, then high level formulas, then lower level formulas, with as much level as needed down to the approximations the \"last\" formulas are doing and explicitly stating that they are abstractions and what this means in the reading of the whole story."

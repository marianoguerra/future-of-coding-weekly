You might defer some of that work, and you might keep the original request in mind to evaluate your effectiveness and correct course over time, but so long as the request is made using language and not a timed series of motor commands injected as electrical impulses directly into your brain stem, it seems compilation is an essential part of the process of doing someone else’s work… yet you seem to hate compilation in every form people have discussed today, be it template matching of pseudo-English all the way down to machine code, or ML-based machine translation to Python—but somehow compilation of short English phrases to Storyscript gets it right?\n\nLike… what if PEP bottomed out at Storyscript, or the OpenAI system emitted Storyscript, allowing someone to write three Storyscript statements using only one command? Neither of those systems were written to preclude this, but you act like their existence is unjustified because they don't.",

You might defer some of that work, and you might keep the original request in mind to evaluate your effectiveness and correct course over time, but so long as the request is made using language and not a timed series of motor commands injected as electrical impulses directly into your brain stem, it seems compilation is an essential part of the process of doing someone else’s work… yet you seem to hate compilation in every form people have discussed today, be it template matching of pseudo-English all the way down to machine code, or ML-based machine translation to Python—but somehow compilation of short English phrases to Storyscript gets it right?\n\nLike… what if PEP bottomed out at Storyscript, or the OpenAI system emitted Storyscript, allowing someone to write three Storyscript statements using only one command?

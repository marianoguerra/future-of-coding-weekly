That seems like an additional wrinkle introduced by Doug Moen.\n\nIn the case of unidirectionality, you'd have some function responsible for insertion into the large list. That function also runs the filter on each newly inserted item, and if an item passes the filter, add it to the filtered list too. If you're doing this in terms of some reactive library, the library should (caveat emptor) be smart enough to not re-filter the entire list on every change, and instead just apply the filter to new items.\n\nTo batch together rapid updates, you'd want a debounce or a throttle — high likelihood your reactive library of choice has those. Otherwise, you can just roll this yourself — you just need _some_ way to schedule code to run after a certain amount of time has passed, and a place to store some intermediate state.\n\nAs for recalculating the projection, mapping should be just as easy as filtering — just do it to each new item as it comes in. Again, all the Rx libraries I've seen are smart about this.\n\nFinally, for reducing, efficiency will depend on the properties of the operation: is it associative? Commutative? Approximate? Can you build a small intermediate result that's easy to incrementally modify and recompute? Etc. This talk gives a nice summary of some good strategies: <https:\/\/www.infoq.com\/presentations\/abstract-algebra-analytics\/>\n\nIt's entirely possible I'm missing details that make this problem far harder than I'm imagining. But I feel like I've done this exact thing a handful of times, both with an without reactive libraries, so hopefully this helps somewhat.\n\nOne more bonus link — all the features you've asked for are documented visually\/interactively here: <https:\/\/rxmarbles.com\/>",

Again, all the Rx libraries I've seen are smart about this.\n\nFinally, for reducing, efficiency will depend on the properties of the operation: is it associative? Commutative? Approximate? Can you build a small intermediate result that's easy to incrementally modify and recompute? Etc. This talk gives a nice summary of some good strategies: "

The program was originally supposed to be called BeeHive\/Hive\/bHive and the individual atomic behaviors Bees, as little individual workers pulling a common rope in a way. This actually still remains in parts of the code, eg the IBee interface which is used for behaviors. Given that these names were taken, my uncertainty about the idea and me having a little epiphany after drawing some device schematic I went with Schéma in the end. I know it isn't super unique in the world of computers, given XML Schema or the Scheme programming language, but I felt like it really fits the idea and that hopefully the long é (which is how you write the word in my native Czech) and later putting it under the scenic.tools umbrella would differentiate it enough.\n\nAlthough the é is usually omitted in most communications as people lack é on their keyboards :grinning:",

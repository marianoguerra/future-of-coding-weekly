Of course these where complex interactions but I think the business model thing is a nice example of a structure and function thing. Open Source is a structure to serve a function from society. I think it exemplifies the strange but important relationship between technology and people. We created institutions like computer science or computer industry but it is very difficult to interact with them. The sheer distance from paying taxes to a published research paper to working piece of software using ideas from research is simply too vast.",

Of course these where complex interactions but I think the business model thing is a nice example of a structure and function thing. Open Source is a structure to serve a function from society. I think it exemplifies the strange but important relationship between technology and people. We created institutions like computer science or computer industry but it is very difficult to interact with them. The sheer distance from paying taxes to a published research paper to working piece of software using ideas from research is simply too vast."

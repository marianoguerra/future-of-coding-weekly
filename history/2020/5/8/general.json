The problem is that often we're operating on a small collection, and the overhead of coordinating the behavior of even two threads is not worthwhile if the collection is smaller than, I don't know, 100 elements or something. Throughout my career I've spent most of my time dealing with many _small_ collections with less than 5 or 50 elements each, and when I'm dealing with medium-size collections of 100-1000 elements, it's often a hashtable, sorted list or array that I'm using as a lookup table in a bigger calculation, rather than something I'm directly using with map\/filter\/reduce. (I do _also_ process larger lists, it's just that the fraction of code doing highly parallelizable work is small.)\n\nSometimes one can rearrange lots of small collections into big arrays to allow more parallelism, but sometimes I can't think of a way to parallelize a lot of this work, e.g. algorithms on tree structures like Loyc trees (code) don't seem parallelizable, generally, although I did design my LES language intentionally to have a \"context-insensitive\" syntax, so at least you can parse all your files in parallel. For these kinds of workloads I really want hardware like I described, which can parallelize short loops efficiently.",

I'll explain the problem by example. Suppose you have:\n\n1. an \"observable\" list of a million items, and you insert or remove an item somewhere in the list\n2. a filtered list based on the million items showing perhaps a thousand of the items\n3. a projection of the filtered list (map\/select)\nSo, when you insert or remove the item, the library should efficiently (and automatically!) propagate the change through the filtered list to the projected list. If the new or removed item is filtered out anyway, propagation should stop so the projected list is not notified of a change. Ideally, change notifications should be deferred in some way so that if several changes are made to the same list item in rapid succession, the derived items (2 and 3) would only be notified once.",

Ideally, change notifications should be deferred in some way so that if several changes are made to the same list item in rapid succession, the derived items (2 and 3) would only be notified once."

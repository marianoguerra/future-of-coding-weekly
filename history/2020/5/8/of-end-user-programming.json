I would like to see technologies like TeX and HTML\/CSS decomposed so that the layout functionality would be separate from the textual language(s), separate from the primitive rendering system, separate from JavaScript. And then I'd like to see layout decomposed further into modules like, for HTML, \"normal\", \"flexbox\", \"table\" and \"grid\"... again and again everybody makes the mistake of making a monolithic system without clear boundaries. It can be good for adoption when there's no good competitors, but in the long run it limits innovation. (The web is kind of oddball in being separated into HTML\/CSS\/JS but treated like a monolith at the same time, so sure your HTML can always contain CSS and JS code... you've got the drawback of learning three languages but without much of the benefit of modularity - edit: okay, there are real benefits of having a monolith, but none that couldn't also be found in a more modular architecture that is composed in a standard way across browsers)",

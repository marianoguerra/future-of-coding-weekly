But imperative programming doesn't scale. The legacy of imperative and shared-mutable-state programming is responsible for our current software crisis. The future of coding is pure functional programming and immutable values.\n\nLarge programs with shared mutable state can't be fully understood or debugged. This problem becomes much worse with multiple cores. The imperative programming community's response to multi-core programming was mutable state shared between threads and processor cores, guarded by mutexes. This is a catastrophically bad programming model. You can't understand or debug the code. The solution is to eliminate shared mutable state.\n\nImperative programming doesn't scale to large numbers of cores--mutual exclusion mechanisms steal most of your performance. The solution is to eliminate shared mutable state. Machine learning with TensorFlow is an important example of massively multi-core programming. What makes it possible is that TensorFlow is a pure functional language. Unfortunately it has to be embedded in Python, because we don't have a mainstream pure functional language yet.\n\nAs an aside, I find it tragic that my personal computer has a 1000 cores (most in the GPU), and most of these cores must remain idle because my system software and apps are written in weak, stone age imperative languages that don't provide a simple and efficient way to distribute computation across a huge number of cores.\n\nImperative programming is a catastrophy for software security. In the imperative model, any function call can change any state in the entire system. This is the root cause of most security flaws. A sort function can encrypt all your files, display a ransom message, and phone home to an internet malware server. And we are seeing these kinds of exploits in supply chain attacks on open source software repositories. Pure functional programming puts security first: functions cannot have side effects, and functions have no access to data that isn't passed as an argument. The type system can trivially guarantee that a sort function will not intentionally spawn a bitcoin miner, or accidently corrupt shared mutable state outside of the array that you are sorting. A common response to the inherent insecurity of imperative code is sandboxing. It's a backwards approach. What if architects built buildings out of contact-sensitive explosive materials, then attempted to mitigate the resulting safety issues using a complex system of nested blast barriers. Imperative programming is inherently insecure, and pure functional programming is the answer.",

                                "text": " Imperative programming (and shared mutable state) was a reasonable idea in the 1950's, 60's and 70's, when programs were small, processors had a single core, and internet-related security holes were not a concern. But imperative programming doesn't scale. The legacy of imperative and shared-mutable-state programming is responsible for our current software crisis. The future of coding is pure functional programming and immutable values.\n\nLarge programs with shared mutable state can't be fully understood or debugged. This problem becomes much worse with multiple cores. The imperative programming community's response to multi-core programming was mutable state shared between threads and processor cores, guarded by mutexes. This is a catastrophically bad programming model. You can't understand or debug the code. The solution is to eliminate shared mutable state.\n\nImperative programming doesn't scale to large numbers of cores--mutual exclusion mechanisms steal most of your performance. The solution is to eliminate shared mutable state. Machine learning with TensorFlow is an important example of massively multi-core programming. What makes it possible is that TensorFlow is a pure functional language. Unfortunately it has to be embedded in Python, because we don't have a mainstream pure functional language yet.\n\nAs an aside, I find it tragic that my personal computer has a 1000 cores (most in the GPU), and most of these cores must remain idle because my system software and apps are written in weak, stone age imperative languages that don't provide a simple and efficient way to distribute computation across a huge number of cores.\n\nImperative programming is a catastrophy for software security. In the imperative model, any function call can change any state in the entire system. This is the root cause of most security flaws. A sort function can encrypt all your files, display a ransom message, and phone home to an internet malware server. And we are seeing these kinds of exploits in supply chain attacks on open source software repositories. Pure functional programming puts security first: functions cannot have side effects, and functions have no access to data that isn't passed as an argument. The type system can trivially guarantee that a sort function will not intentionally spawn a bitcoin miner, or accidently corrupt shared mutable state outside of the array that you are sorting. A common response to the inherent insecurity of imperative code is sandboxing. It's a backwards approach. What if architects built buildings out of contact-sensitive explosive materials, then attempted to mitigate the resulting safety issues using a complex system of nested blast barriers. Imperative programming is inherently insecure, and pure functional programming is the answer."

Since all programs must eventually map their syntax into the underlying instructions of the Intel or ARM processors, the only difference between 2 languages can be the convenience, conciseness, shareability, and maintainability of the notation. There are languages like FORTH that trade everything for brevity, but nobody programs in FORTH because it is unmaintainable. The ability to share components in the FP languages I have seen is not exemplary. The idiocy of having millions of programmers reinvent the same programs over and over is quite absurd.

Sure, pure functions are one solution to this and they are extremely useful, but there are other ways that can be useful too. Better ways to handle value and reference semantics, for instance. I’m excited for what is being explored in Swift and Rust (and C++)."

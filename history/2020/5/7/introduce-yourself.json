I've been listening to the podcast for a while (I think I cam across it after seeing some of Ivan's Hest gifs on twitter) - anyway love the idea of the 2 minute week and thought I'd stop lurking and start participating.\n\nI have a background in architecture (physical buildings), somehow found myself making project management software for architects. I now find that a bit conventional and am trying to take it to more interesting places (2 minute video soon!)\n\nI've been trying to show my developer and designer friends Bret Victor videos for years, and they never get it - it's good to find others equally interested in the future of programming! (for the longest time I though I was the only one haha) I enjoy programming but also find it kind of terrible. All these things you're all working on are very amazing and I hope to use them to improve my life one - and hopefully I can even participate a little as well!",

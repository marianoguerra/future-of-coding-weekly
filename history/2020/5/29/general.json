OK, but what are those rules? Is it by character class, as in Smalltalk? Some characters are only allowed in infix identifiers, and others only in standard identifiers? With mixing forbidden? Then... how do you handle the creation of synthetic identifiers in macros? Stuff like Lisp's gensym.\nYeah, disjoint character classes. The major restriction is that you can't use `-` in variables, which is a bitter pill to swallow. (Mu gave up Lisp to get back `-` :slightly_smiling_face:)\n\nI don't follow the gensym question. Wart expands `$x` inside macros to something like `x1234`. But it doesn't support infix operators. Is that what you're wondering? It never occurred to me to create new infix operators inside macros.",

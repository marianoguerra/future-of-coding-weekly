Being web-based greatly increased the ease of writing extensions that involve GUI elements.\n\nI'm curious to hear about what others consider important milestones for extensions in text editors? For example, I'd love to hear more about any prior art to TextMate? Before package managers for Vim and Emacs, how did people share syntax highlighting files? And were there examples in other text editors that went beyond syntax highlighting, e.g., did any text editors prior to 2004 have a plugin system that could do more than just add syntax highlighting, like adding commands?"

        "text": "Here’s my cognitive-science-hobbyist theory of what’s the problem with node-link languages:\n\nNode-link makes effective use of the link image schema (<https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Image_schema|https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Image_schema>). Such schemas are universal patterns that structure our thinking on the lowest levels. These patterns also provide the infrastructure for spoken and written language as well, so they sit both under visual and text-based languages. (If “sitting under” makes sense to you in that previous sentence, that’s because it’s an example for a spatial metaphor build on top of image schemas.)\n\nNode-link languages work well, because they hook into that particular link pattern which we all intuitively understand. That’s where their power comes from. Unfortunately, one pattern isn’t enough to model everything. However, it’s great when it’s almost all you need in the domain you are modeling for.\n\nSome node-link languages add a second image schema by allowing containment. The container schema is also why files and folders and directory structures are so pervasive. That’s a little more expressive, but two patterns are still not enough to model all the complex things general programming languages can.\n\nWhere node-link languages break down is: they usually offer no solution to the problem of anchoring things to locations. It usually doesn’t matter where you put nodes on an often infinite canvas. Location has no meaning, like it does in a map, or a scatter plot, where each dot is precisely tied to a location. \n\nWhile placing things arbitrarily on a canvas sounds positive like flexibility and freedom, it creates cognitive effort because we will quickly feel overwhelmed placing large number of objects in a space without any supporting structure. So we invent that structure on the fly, trying something like ordering nodes by data flow, which works well enough for when you’re just modeling how data flows through a number of filters and transformers. But often we end up with conflicting structures. That’s when we start talking about how it all looks like spaghettis.\n\nFor some reason media apps are good at taking advantage of image schemas and metaphorical structuring, which I believe is all happy accidents simply because these patterns are how we think and when designing UI we gravitate towards them even if we don’t know why. \n\nThink waveform visualizations in audio recording software or MIDI notes. X-axis is often bound to time giving position meaning — the same reason why charts and diagrams are often easier to grasp: image schemas giving rise to powerful spatial metaphors.\n\nThat media apps seem to discover these schemas is less of a coincidence and connected to how we understand media as events spread across time (yep, guess what’s the basis for that…). In general programming we think much more abstract and have many completely incompatible orderings at the same time, e.g. data flow with concurrency, static type hierarchies, hierarchical stack frames, sequential memory — it’s easy to visualize each one of them at a time, but it’s essentially just different views on the same system.\n\nI firmly believe that we can deliberately take advantage of this particular knowledge in cognitive science in UI design and ultimately for designing better “visual” languages. If you see any research that’s combining these fields, please send it my way. And if you want to learn more about the cognitive science parts feel free to contact me. I’m happy to provide plenty of pointers to resources I can recommend.",

                "text": "An image schema is a recurring structure within our cognitive processes which establishes patterns of understanding and reasoning. Image schemas are formed from our bodily interactions, from linguistic experience, and from historical context. The term is explained in Mark Johnson's book The Body in the Mind; in case study 2 of George Lakoff's Women, Fire and Dangerous Things; by Rudolf Arnheim in Visual Thinking; and more recently, by Tim Rohrer's 2006 book chapter \"Image Schemata in the Brain\".\nIn contemporary cognitive linguistics, an image schema is considered an embodied prelinguistic structure of experience that motivates conceptual metaphor mappings. Evidence for image schemas (also called image schemata) is drawn from a number of related disciplines, including work on cross-modal cognition in psychology, from spatial cognition in both linguistics and psychology, cognitive linguistics, and from neuroscience.",

                "text": "The Deutsch limit is an aphorism about the information density of visual programming languages originated by L. Peter Deutsch that states:\n\nThe problem with visual programming is that you can’t have more than 50 visual primitives on the screen at the same time.The term was made up by Fred Lakin, after Deutsch made the following comment at a talk on visual programming by Scott Kim and Warren Robinett: \"Well, this is all fine and well, but the problem with visual programming languages is that you can’t have more than 50 visual primitives on the screen at the same time. How are you going to write an operating system?\"The primitives in a visual language are the separate graphical elements used to build a program, and having more of them available at the same time allows the programmer to read more information. This limit is sometimes cited as an example of the advantage of textual over visual languages, pointing out the greater information density of text, and posing a difficulty in scaling the language.However, criticisms of the limit include that it is not clear whether a similar limit also exists in textual programming languages; and that the limit could be overcome by applying modularity to visual programming as is commonly done in textual programming.",

For example hitting \"a\" then \"s\" adds a script node just below the current node, then hitting \"i\" connects the node input to the output of the previous, etc.\n\nI agree this kind of manipulations is reserved to power users, but as Ivan previously said it is important to make things work fine for power users and it shows that if the mouse is seen as a complicated way to edit\/navigate one can also imagine some easier way to do things.",

        "text": "&gt; moving stuff out of the way\n3d modelling tools have solved this problem without automatic layout. They give you rich tools to manipulate objects in space, and the space itself, by leveraging the properties of the structure of objects and space.\n\nWant to insert something in the middle of a dense mesh? Grab a vertex and spread out new vertices along every inbound edge, turning the original vertex into a face — in 1 keypress + click. Or, slice a plane through the mesh, and push both halves of the mesh apart. Or, band-select all the faces pointing toward the camera, and pull them away from all the faces looking away from the camera. At all times, you have full control over exactly where every vertex is, and when editing in bulk, exactly how each vertex is moving — you would absolutely not want to tell the program \"just move my vertices out of the way _somehow_\".\n\nThere are, also, automatic tools you can use. But the manual modelling tools are so good, you rarely want to use the automatic tools. (This gets more weedsy when talking about animation, UV mapping, mesh sculpting, etc. — those areas have manual+automatic hybrids. But they're also less about putting things in places and more about setting relationships, which is relevant to us, but not relevant to this question.)\n\n&gt; Are we agreeing that the ideal is not node+wire?\nA rich symbolic algebra editor could (and should) just be another node.

They give you rich tools to manipulate objects in space, and the space itself, by leveraging the properties of the structure of objects and space.\n\nWant to insert something in the middle of a dense mesh? Grab a vertex and spread out new vertices along every inbound edge, turning the original vertex into a face — in 1 keypress + click. Or, slice a plane through the mesh, and push both halves of the mesh apart. Or, band-select all the faces pointing toward the camera, and pull them away from all the faces looking away from the camera. At all times, you have full control over exactly where every vertex is, and when editing in bulk, exactly how each vertex is moving — you would absolutely not want to tell the program \"just move my vertices out of the way "

I didn't know about makespace but that looks great too.\n\nThe main thing that struck me about Mercury isn't just the clean UI but that the software is organized around 'app-free intentions aka flows'. All operating systems (iOS, Linux, Windows) are very app oriented. Mercury provides your 'intention' or 'workflow' as a concrete organizational model. Typically you jump from app to app to app to acomplish a given intention - the thread of intention just lives in your head, but nothing connects the corresponding windows on your screen. Mercury solves this.\n\nCheck out this 'flow' of a single intention (getting coffee with a friend) that spans multiple apps - nothing like this exists in any mainstream OS: <https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1000\/1*0hAZt7GMWzgSjSDK5VBwCA.gif>\n\nI would *love* to create threads that connect snippets of information across multiple 'apps' - all are related to one intention. Unfortunately what I do is just reframe a calendar view or mail view I already have open (for one purpose) to another purpose. I end up with a cluster of app windows with different purposes all mixed together. Not at all ideal, but something we're just used to I guess.",

I didn't know about makespace but that looks great too.\n\nThe main thing that struck me about Mercury isn't just the clean UI but that the software is organized around 'app-free intentions aka flows'. All operating systems (iOS, Linux, Windows) are very app oriented. Mercury provides your 'intention' or 'workflow' as a concrete organizational model. Typically you jump from app to app to app to acomplish a given intention - the thread of intention just lives in your head, but nothing connects the corresponding windows on your screen. Mercury solves this.\n\nCheck out this 'flow' of a single intention (getting coffee with a friend) that spans multiple apps - nothing like this exists in any mainstream OS: "

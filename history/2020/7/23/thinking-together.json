        "text": "Has anyone been searching for an \"ideal\" model for information? By this I mean an _abstract_ model (not a DRAM\/disk representation) with a vocabulary that allows a *human* to read, specify, and understand information with ease. We have existing models like RDF (\"Semantic web\") and property graphs (e.g. Neo4j), and in programming languages we have object graphs (OO languages), trees (functional languages), and tables (relational DBs). None of these models seem to have arisen as \"the one true answer\", partially because they are all difficult to reason about when operated on programmatically (or so I claim). I want a model for information that allows us to easily understand both *static* information structures (snapshots) and *programmatically-maintained* information structures (an evolving, stateful system).\n\nThe ideal model for information might define concepts like \"pointing\" (edges) or \"nesting\" (groups), and each concept will have a clear meaning. The ideal model will also have a semantics for *mutation*, e.g. you will know when you define a relationship like `A points to B` whether `B` can be deleted or modified in some way, and how this affects the `points to` connection. The model will also have a notion of *stewardship* of information, i.e. it should be easy to observe the *source* of a piece of information, and to know whether it is mutable or just a snapshot. (Yes, I believe the ideal model for information should have a vocabulary to describe distribution and trust).\n\nHas anyone here thought hard about this? I've been churning on it for a month or two recently, and for many months over the last few years; I can't proceed with my own PL project until I get fundamentals like this right, since the model that I develop will fundamentally determine what a \"program\" even is. I think a key reason why discovering \"the future of programming\" is so hard is that we think too much about code and not enough about information. *Code exists purely to transform information*, and if you don't make strides on models for information then I don't think you can make strides on programming languages.\n\nI have some ideas about a model, but I have no insights from others to validate it against. My conception is a very specific hybrid of mutable *graphs* and immutable ~trees~ *nested sets* that distinguishes between *descriptions* and *references*, and it seems very amenable to compact 2D representations, unlike most graphs. I won't describe it further just yet, since I don't want to skew anyone's responses.\n\nAnyway, I'd love to hear from other people who have been thinking about this kind of stuff.",

Is the fact that I'm \"holding my tea cup\" a property of myself, or am I just in a relationship with my tea cup?\n\n&gt; At a more abstract level, you have symbols of value, order of those symbols and their aggregations, bags\/sets of symbols.\nWhat is a \"symbol of value\"? I don't quite understand that term. And you seem to recognise both *sets* and *bags*? I've always found those to be in contention with one another, and so I've (for the meantime) concluded that if a user is in a scenario where they want a bag (which should be rare), they can simulate it with a set quite easily. The converse is not possible, though.\n\n&gt; So, as you can probably deduce, I've settled on something that looks like objects that have unique identity, which are bags of properties\nI've currently settled on two notions that together can act like a conventional object. The first is something I'm tentatively calling a *picture*, which is a *set* with an exterior label (I call it the *topic*) that contains *symbols* and\/or further pictures (these are called *subtopics*). These can be used to form the \"descriptions\" I was hinting at earlier; they are immutable value types. If you want a picture to be mutable (and thus behave like an object), you can stick it in a *workspace*, which is the unit of mutability. Workspaces are identified (and thus referenced, and queried) by the aforementioned symbols. A workspace's state evolves by a *rulebook* (a set of *rules*), which updates a workspace's picture in response to *events*. I plan to base the semantics of rules on logic programming. The end result will be something like \"nested Datalog\", though there is no literature that matches the model I described above.\n\nPicture topics replace the need to have a special notion of a statically-specified \"attribute\", because the topic can itself be any value. This should hopefully make meta-programming possible, but at the very least, I hope it leads to a very minimalist (and intuitive) semantics.\n\nAll of the above is subject to change, of course! Given my current track record, I wouldn't be surprised if I find some major flaw in this kind of architecture.",

This should hopefully make meta-programming possible, but at the very least, I hope it leads to a very minimalist (and intuitive) semantics.\n\nAll of the above is subject to change, of course!

In the paper I linked, we built the system to purge whatever was no longer linked. In another system one might have a policy of \"versions older than a year to which no one holds a dangling pointer\". In either case, I would strongly encourage you _not_ to consider practical matters of performance or storage efficiency at this stage. Go a bit mad, follow untrodden paths, find weird things!\n\nAs for expressivity\/ease of triples, one would expect a system that can construct other representations on top of triples for ease of use. What that looks like in your domain is a very open question. :slightly_smiling_face:",

        "text": "&gt; I've currently settled on two notions that together can act like a conventional object. The first is something I'm tentatively calling a *picture*, which is a *set* with an exterior label (I call it the *topic*) that contains *symbols* and\/or further pictures (these are called *subtopics*). These can be used to form the \"descriptions\" I was hinting at earlier; they are immutable value types. If you want a picture to be mutable (and thus behave like an object), you can stick it in a *workspace*, which is the unit of mutability. Workspaces are identified (and thus referenced, and queried) by the aforementioned symbols. A workspace's state evolves by a *rulebook* (a set of *rules*), which updates a workspace's picture in response to *events*. I plan to base the semantics of rules on logic programming. The end result will be something like \"nested Datalog\", though there is no literature that matches the model I described above.\n&gt; Picture topics replace the need to have a special notion of a statically-specified \"attribute\", because the topic can itself be any value. This should hopefully make meta-programming possible, but at the very least, I hope it leads to a very minimalist (and intuitive) semantics.\nThis is what prompted my question above: who are your target audience? Is this going to be intuitive to everyone, if it's non-techies you're after?",

Even before web assembly, I think the parts where there.\n\nThe death of flash is one of the big reasons web browsers started to grow the necessary features to replace flash(for better or worse). Web assembly might be the final piece, because it allows a single binary blob to be easily embedded and run. We just need to get better at compression (which is actively being worked on.)\n\n<@UC6997THT> My question for you is, if you think all the pieces are not there. What pieces do you think are missing? Not which product is missing, we wouldn't be having this discussion if a finished product already existed, but which technological or social pieces are missing?",

Even before web assembly, I think the parts where there.\n\nThe death of flash is one of the big reasons web browsers started to grow the necessary features to replace flash(for better or worse). Web assembly might be the final piece, because it allows a single binary blob to be easily embedded and run. We just need to get better at compression (which is actively being worked on.)\n\n"

This can look like event listeners, AOP, pipelines, or components communicating indirectly with each other through some \"mediator\" or \"command\" pattern. Those things can have their place, but if it's to split apart a larger whole, rather than to incorporate multiple unrelated whole things that don't need to work together, than that's not modularity: you're going to have to reverse engineer everything and trace the cause and effect all over the place, to really understand what's happening in that code, and you're opening the door for race conditions and unexpected breakages when things change.

This can look like event listeners, AOP, pipelines, or components communicating indirectly with each other through some \"mediator\" or \"command\" pattern. Those things can have their place, but if it's to split apart a larger whole, rather than to incorporate multiple unrelated whole things that don't need to work together, than that's not modularity: you're going to have to reverse engineer everything and trace the cause and effect all over the place, to really understand what's happening in that code, and you're opening the door for race conditions and unexpected breakages when things change. The whole point of modularity is to make it easy to understand and change things."

It’s a book about buildings(but so much more), and one theme is his rejection of architecture as this highly professionalized, prescriptive, and paternalistic practice, instead advocating for the users of the building to be fully involved in its creation and ongoing maintenance. And to echo Doug’s quotes from Ilich, part of that is rejecting industrial methods that diminish the individual.\n\nI feel strongly it has many deep parallels to the current situation we’re in with software, and it has inspired me to create software that truly empowers people and makes them feel alive."

My Curv language has exactly 2 levels because Curv can be either interpreted on a CPU, or it can be compiled into GPU shader code and run on a GPU. The run time requirements for these two execution environments are quite different. On the GPU, I can't have a garbage collector, or first class function values, or general run-time polymorphism, whereas on the CPU, I can.

You don't want to have a garbage-collected runtime environment inside an operating system kernel, because garbage collection pauses are incompatible with real time programming. For example, you need to be able process interrupts with guaranteed latency bounds.

        "text": "<@UCUSW7WVD>  thanks for clarifying! In this case I have a few more thoughts that may be useful:\n * Designing a language to purposely help increase the understanding of the problem would be interesting. Maybe allowing for both specific -&gt; general (like TDD) and general -&gt; specific (like Haskell type declarations before impl). Idris and type-driven development is one angle that's interesting here, and rust\/elm\/purescript+typedholes also leads devs to have a \"conversation\" with the compiler as well. (FWIW, I'm fairly ignorant of Mu so unsure what opinion it takes here, if any).\n * M*N situations do arise sadly. Most of abstract algebra and category theory is about describing ways to simplify and (hopefully) efficiently compose these cases. I believe that tools can help us with these, such as statebox, but the barrier to entry feels pretty high still. I worked on this a bit at Invision too (fun exceptions when nesting state machines that non-programming designers needed to be able to \"configure\"). [Side note: M*N problems are particularly annoying to represent in a linear view like text-based languages.  There's fun stuff from the category theory people on diagrammung multi-dimensional composition \"easier\" but I haven't seen non-math nerds be able to develop intuition around them yet. ]\n * Delaying complexity until later is super important to prototyping quickly. The problem is *knowing* that you skipped over something and if you are \"polluting your signal.\" I believe the sweet spot here is gradually typed languages, though I'd say they have mixed results in terms of lowering complexity so far. I'd bet that AI would be able to \"fill in the blanks\" sooner than they could design the skeleton.",

In this case I have a few more thoughts that may be useful:\n * Designing a language to purposely help increase the understanding of the problem would be interesting. Maybe allowing for both specific -> general (like TDD) and general -> specific (like Haskell type declarations before impl). Idris and type-driven development is one angle that's interesting here, and rust\/elm\/purescript+typedholes also leads devs to have a \"conversation\" with the compiler as well. (FWIW, I'm fairly ignorant of Mu so unsure what opinion it takes here, if any).\n * M*N situations do arise sadly. Most of abstract algebra and category theory is about describing ways to simplify and (hopefully) efficiently compose these cases. I believe that tools can help us with these, such as statebox, but the barrier to entry feels pretty high still. I worked on this a bit at Invision too (fun exceptions when nesting state machines that non-programming designers needed to be able to \"configure\"). [Side note: M*N problems are particularly annoying to represent in a linear view like text-based languages.  There's fun stuff from the category theory people on diagrammung multi-dimensional composition \"easier\" but I haven't seen non-math nerds be able to develop intuition around them yet. ]\n * Delaying complexity until later is super important to prototyping quickly. The problem is *knowing* that you skipped over something and if you are \"polluting your signal.\" I believe the sweet spot here is gradually typed languages, though I'd say they have mixed results in terms of lowering complexity so far. I'd bet that AI would be able to \"fill in the blanks\" sooner than they could design the skeleton."

Political revolutions that try to do away with elites invariably seem to either fail quickly, or install new elites without meaning to. So the question for me is not how to get rid of elites, but how to try and ensure the ones we end up with are better than the last lot.",

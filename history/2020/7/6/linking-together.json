My bad for not looking deeper but it was irrelevant to the point. The point isn't that they cost 30 cents each or $2.50 each. The point is you need lots of them. I only own a single thing that eats batteries, that's my Oculus controllers. They eat ~1 AA battery a month. That means mostly not thinking about it. I buy a pack of 6-12 AA batteries and I'm set for a 6 months to a year. Otherwise the only things in my life that eat batteries are a couple of remotes which need a new battery every 2-3 years. My 6 PS4 controllers (4 dual shock, 2 moves). My 4 switch controllers, my 4 phones, my tablet, all recharge. Oh, I used to use a bluetooth mouse on my desktop, it required a AA battery but less than once a year. So no, don't own a single thing that used batteries at the same level as a set of these would use.\n\nHere we have a device that needs 6 to 36 new batteries every XX hours. From the links you posted\n\n&gt; I am getting 30+ hours on CR2032s.\n&gt; \n&gt; ... We arrive at our ~50 hours of gameplay by this measure,\n&gt; \n&gt; I also have a full set of LIR2032 (rechargeable equivalent), - maybe 8 hours on a charge.\nSomeone mentions recharger. Again, maybe I didn't look deep enough. I only see chargers that take 4 batteries so either I have be vigilant and make sure I always have a full set of 18-36 charged else I need 5 to 9 chargers.\n\nI went through this same issue with candles. I can buy wax candles (100 for $4) <https:\/\/www.ikea.com\/us\/en\/p\/glimma-unscented-tealights-50097995\/> but of course they have a certain amount of danger given they are actually on fire. I looked into battery powered ones (<https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Flameless-Vivii-Battery-powered-Unscented-Tealights\/dp\/B01MQ1Q3R1\/>) which are also relatively cheap (36 for $9) but they require 36 spare batteries which I decided I didn't want to deal with that so decided against buying the candles.",

Looks like the batteries generally cost &gt; $1 each so add another $40 every couple of weeks.\"\n\nAnd then you dug in on your point more:\n\"I just went on Amazon for prices of cr2032. They were $1-$1.50 a piece so if you have 36 of these then it will be ~$36 every 2-4 weeks if you actually use them. First hit on <http:\/\/Walmart.com|Walmart.com> has them at $3 a piece\"\n\nYour point was very obviously about the cost of the batteries, not the concept of batteries in general. *Not once did you mention recharging in your posts*.  *Not once did you talk about the design decision itself*. Your arguments solely focused on the cost of the batteries. You are also making a lot of assumptions about the usage that are just plain wrong. I literally own a set, and am on the community for these things, and I'm telling you it's not an issue. But instead of taking my word for it, you are attacking me and telling me I'm wrong? even though I actually own them, and you are just making assumptions out of thin air?\n\nYou honestly sound like a person who had their point shown to be wrong, but are too prideful to admit it, and instead you are backtracking and jumping onto a different point entirely, and attacking me. That's not constructive at all.\n\n<@UEQ6M68H0> gives a much more compelling argument about charging. In fact, I think Edward's idea about the charging setup with a capacitor is interesting. They continue to iterate on the design, so it might even be worth bringing up to the company in their forums.\n\nI agree that the battery solution is \"un-ecological and retrograde\". I also know it made their circuit design and production much easier to get done. There is some interview or post where they talk about this that I can't find atm.\n\n\"If you are going to use them, say for a class at a school, then I'd expect several hours of use a week. As such you will need to keep a large supply of batteries and it will add up to basically a constant maintenance fee\"\n\nWhile it's un-ecological, it's also extremely cheap, and completely normal in today's economy. You are acting like this is outrageous and unheard of. You buy new batteries for TV remote controls, rc toys, and small electronics all the time. You buy new light bulbs when your light bulbs die.\n\nSchools and libraries spend huge amounts on replacing entire computers every year. Buying batteries in bulk like this would be a negligible part of their budget.\nIt's really not an argument against them.",

I also know it made their circuit design and production much easier to get done. There is some interview or post where they talk about this that I can't find atm.\n\n\"If you are going to use them, say for a class at a school, then I'd expect several hours of use a week. As such you will need to keep a large supply of batteries and it will add up to basically a constant maintenance fee\"\n\nWhile it's un-ecological, it's also extremely cheap, and completely normal in today's economy. You are acting like this is outrageous and unheard of. You buy new batteries for TV remote controls, rc toys, and small electronics all the time. You buy new light bulbs when your light bulbs die.\n\nSchools and libraries spend huge amounts on replacing entire computers every year. Buying batteries in bulk like this would be a negligible part of their budget.\nIt's really not an argument against them."

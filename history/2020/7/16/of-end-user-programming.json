I would love to see some of my friends here on the stream to ask questions!\nI aim to keep it high-level and quick paced. Something along the lines of:\n1. What we're building – overarching design &amp; principles 10 min (+ 5 min for answering clarifying questions)\n2. High-level view of the tools we're using to build Storyscript's editor (Rust \/ WASM, a HTML content editor, &amp; the roles of these tools)\n3. How we leverage ECS \/ data-oriented programming for high flexibility and maintainability\nThere's a lot of overlapping problems with language development, but our approach with a rich text editor give us some new ways to approach old problems!\n<https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/storyscript>",

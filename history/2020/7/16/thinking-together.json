I had no idea how terrible Mongo is at querying even basic relationships and I find Neo4j's Cypher query language a bit of a learning curve for me. Arango's query language is a lot closer to sql but instead of joins it uses graphdb-like queries - I actually find it easier to use than sql. On top of that, I can also add micro-services directly on the database server which might be useful in the future if I decide to process formulas on the db. I think it's a nice mix of everyone's suggestions, and thanks again for your help!",

I had no idea how terrible Mongo is at querying even basic relationships and I find Neo4j's Cypher query language a bit of a learning curve for me. Arango's query language is a lot closer to sql but instead of joins it uses graphdb-like queries - I actually find it easier to use than sql. On top of that, I can also add micro-services directly on the database server which might be useful in the future if I decide to process formulas on the db. I think it's a nice mix of everyone's suggestions, and thanks again for your help!"

I understand why you made those decisions, but it does seem intuitively \"weird\" to me.\n\nIs it just because it's foreign to me and different from the status quo, or do those choices fundamentally make the language more or less clear in some way?\n\nYou already make a distinction between SubX with syntax sugar and SubX without syntax sugar. Is it worth it to add another layer of syntax sugar for translating bases (or translating mnemonics)?\n\nI've been thinking about your mnemonics debate. IIUC, You are worried about ambiguity, but if it's a \"separate pass\" it could be easily user modifiable, allowing the user to choose names that are less ambiguous to them. You could have \"syntax skins\".\n\nMore layers of syntax sugar arguably goes against your principle, \"It uses as few notations (languages, syntaxes, intermediate representations) as possible.\"\nBut it might help with the principle of \"It focuses on encoding intention\". Or at least encoding understanding. I'm not sure. I very easily fall into the trap of assuming \"more productive\" is equivalent to \"better understanding\".",

I understand why you made those decisions, but it does seem intuitively \"weird\" to me.\n\nIs it just because it's foreign to me and different from the status quo, or do those choices fundamentally make the language more or less clear in some way?\n\nYou already make a distinction between SubX with syntax sugar and SubX without syntax sugar. Is it worth it to add another layer of syntax sugar for translating bases (or translating mnemonics)?\n\nI've been thinking about your mnemonics debate. IIUC, You are worried about ambiguity, but if it's a \"separate pass\" it could be easily user modifiable, allowing the user to choose names that are less ambiguous to them. You could have \"syntax skins\".\n\nMore layers of syntax sugar arguably goes against your principle, \"It uses as few notations (languages, syntaxes, intermediate representations) as possible.\"\nBut it might help with the principle of \"It focuses on encoding intention\". Or at least encoding understanding. I'm not sure. I very easily fall into the trap of assuming \"more productive\" is equivalent to \"better understanding\"."

Typoing `8d` for `8f` seems easier than typoing `copy` for `pop`.\n• Con: per-opcode mnemonics are an additional set of things for the new reader to understand and navigate. And cross-correlate with the Intel manual, since it only gives names to sets of opcodes.\n• Con: tooling may have a hard time giving a good error message when a user typos one variant of say `add` for another.",

That probably gives away some bias I have :smile:\n\nYou have definitely made me question some assumptions I had about assembly language. I intuitively want mnemonics. I think your worry about making the user have to look up extra tables in their mind may not be as big of a problem as you think (especially if you provide good documentation). But you bring up some really good points about the implementation complexity, especially around error messages at this level.\n\nIf you do support mnemonics, also supporting a base 10 to base 16 translation seems like a natural next step. The two syntax sugars compliment each other.\n\nThere is probably still value in having a base 10 translation pass without a mnemonics pass, but maybe less so.\n\n\"That'll require a newcomer to actually spend time with Mu and tell me how easy it has been for them to learn\/retain.\"\n\nlol.

I think your worry about making the user have to look up extra tables in their mind may not be as big of a problem as you think (especially if you provide good documentation). But you bring up some really good points about the implementation complexity, especially around error messages at this level.\n\nIf you do support mnemonics, also supporting a base 10 to base 16 translation seems like a natural next step. The two syntax sugars compliment each other.\n\nThere is probably still value in having a base 10 translation pass without a mnemonics pass, but maybe less so.\n\n\"That'll require a newcomer to actually spend time with Mu and tell me how easy it has been for them to learn\/retain.\"\n\nlol. I get the hint. Curiosity might get the better of me and convince me to pull the repo and play with Mu. But I make no promises "

This is a hard topic to discuss with the same rigour as computer science or PL design but I think it is one of the most important topics for this community to tackle.\n\nTo help bring some rigour to this conversation I’d like to bring up some incredibly important academic work which you can check out should you want to. <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Surveillance_capitalism|Surveillance Capitalism> and <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Platform_capitalism|Platform Capitalism> (these models aren’t in competition) are two of the best and most current models of economics, and _could not exist without computing_. They are both worthy of your time and have lots of explanatory and predictive power. They also point to a very important point for us: The technical challenge alone will not fix computing, nor will design. It’s not as simple as changing the incentives for companies or decentralising software, and not as straightforward as improving coding by a few orders of magnitude.\n\nSo, if we as a community want to change coding forever and for good, we must also understand the societal, political and economic context we exist in. I’d love to hear thoughts and discuss this but want to guide this conversation away from some pitfalls and towards productive conversation.\n\nThings we don’t need to discuss:\n• Personal opinions on wether capitalism sucks or not\n• Opinions on social media or corporate giants and their many problems or evils\n• The kind of discussions and critiques we have again and again all over social media around capitalism, Web 2.0, platforms, giant tech companies, etcetera.\nSome things this community could benefit from discussing:\n• Concrete research and resources to learn more, inform ourselves and each other.\n• Ways in which we can facilitate true _systemic change_ through our work here.\n• Questions that we think are worth exploring\n• Ways for this community to keep growing its understanding of economic context, the complex structures behind them, and improve our collective reasoning and decision making.",

It’s not as simple as changing the incentives for companies or decentralising software, and not as straightforward as improving coding by a few orders of magnitude.\n\nSo, if we as a community want to change coding forever and for good, we must also understand the societal, political and economic context we exist in. I’d love to hear thoughts and discuss this but want to guide this conversation away from some pitfalls and towards productive conversation.\n\nThings we don’t need to discuss:\n"

Align all our metrics and system optimization on the one constraint a flat world hasn't made disappear: neighbourhoods. We all live somewhere. Design success in one neighbourhood, and scale it to neighbourhoods. Ignore other metrics.\nAlong the way, I'm sure we'll get to test drive some pretty nifty tech solutions. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:",

Here's what I'm thinking we could do, as a 5-part plan:\n\n*1.* *Rename <#C5T9GPWFL|general> to #questions-and-ideas*\n\nThis is the channel for thinking out loud, asking questions, sharing ideas, brainstorming. Not for links, but otherwise identical to how we've been using <#C5T9GPWFL|general>.\n\n*2. Rename <#C5U3SEW6A|random> to #off-topic*\n\nThis is the channel for things that aren't immediately related to the future of coding, but that would still be interesting to our community.\n\n*3. Rename <#CCL5VVBAN|feedback> to #your-work*\n\n<#CCL5VVBAN|feedback> is great to have, but I feel like it is ever so slightly too narrow in focus, and the renaming would make it broader. This channel would be the place to share whatever you're working on. Ask for specific types of feedback if you want it, or just share your latest blog post, newsletter, appearance on an (inferior, competing) podcast, etc. to reach our community as an audience and harvest fresh high-fives.\n\n*4. Create a new #stimulating-links channel*\n\nThis is the other half of how we've been using <#C5T9GPWFL|general>. We'd use this channel to post FoC-relevant links to articles, videos, tweets, books, etc. made by other people outside our community.\n\n*5. Update the set of default channels*\n\nThe default channels for new members will be:\n\n• <#CC2JRGVLK|introductions>\n• <#CEXED56UR|meta>\n• #questions-and-ideas\n• #off-topic\n• #stimulating-links\n• <#C0120A3L30R|two-minute-week>\n• #your-work\nThere are a bunch of other channels not included in the default set, to keep new members from being overwhelmed. Ignoring the location-based\/meetup channels, the remaining non-defaults are:\n\n• <#CFQUMT7M3|1-on-1s>\n• <#CLYCGTCPL|end-user-programming> \n• <#C0133ED5811|functional-programming> \n• <#CE1R695T7|graphics> \n• <#CGMJ7323Z|jobs> \n• <#CEZ6QTHL1|music>\nNote that every channel, default and non-default, now starts with a unique letter of the alphabet. This should hopefully cut down on folks posting to <#CE1R695T7|graphics> instead of <#C5T9GPWFL|general> (which totally happens).\n\nLet me know what you think of this plan.",

You can use a graph to model a set of relationships, but a graph *is not itself* a set of relationships. I think we should talk about \"entities\" and \"pointers\" between them as a *potential use case* for graphs rather than talking about graphs first and figuring out their applicability thereafter. Otherwise our thought patterns will never escape from our preconceptions of what a graph _is_ and _can be_.",

These are cognitive patterns that we all use to structure our understanding.\n\nA “bucket” is an instance of the _container_ schema. Things are either in it or not, and it has a boundary (which we might or might not be able to describe precisely). That means that the container is of a different quality than the elements it contains.\n\nA “tag” is an instance of the _link_ schema. It just means there is something that connects the things at the two ends like a rope (imagine the force you feel when two items are tied together with a rope; and it is such physicality that gives meaning to the abstract concept). The two items connected to each other don’t automatically have different “status” like in the container version, although they could have through other schemas in effect simultaneously.\n\nWe can cope with the same things being in different containers at once, usually through frames, which are larger contexts of experience. E.g. when you say “cut the flesh” and you are in a restaurant, you evoke completely different images than when you’re a surgeon in a hospital. And it even works out ok on the surgeon’s night out to the steak house. ;-)\n\nNow if you use a tag to signify membership to a group, e.g. all blog articles tagged with “technology”, then it’s used much more like a container and likely understood based on the container schema.\n\nThere are also more complex image schemas that could be relevant, for instance _whole-part_, which is a little like a container, but where the elements don’t just have to be present, but also need to be arranged in a certain configuration for the whole to emerge. E.g. if you disassemble your car and still have all the parts, it’s not really a car anymore. (That’s also behind the layers example Kartik made in the other thread.)\n\nOr take the _center-periphery_ schema. This is how we understand gradual or fuzzy relations. Some things are “core” or central, and if you change them the thing is no longer the same thing, e,g. a tree where you cut the trunk is still a tree, but it’s not the same tree anymore. Other things are peripheral and can change, but if they do the thing still stays the same. E.g. if the tree loses all leads in winter it’s still the same tree. Oh, did you have a haircut recently? No problem, still you.\n\nThe difference between “bucket” and “tag” can be as simple as _container_ vs. _link_, depending on how you use it. \nIf the identity of an object changes when it’s modified in different places, does it mean it wasn’t supposed to be the same thing in the first place? This is at the core(!) of programming issues around value vs. reference types and affects your system design. What parts of the elements tagged or put into buckets can change without making them a different thing?",

That is another great example of a modern Flash games like market! <http:\/\/poke.com|poke.com> looks interesting as well.\n\n&gt; but it's a way higher barrier to entry than flash ever was. There's no doing anything in Pico-8 without code but there was plenty of flash with no or minimal code.\nGood point. I can see that much of your argument is about barrier to entry and ease of use.  :+1:\n\nNow about your 4 things. I'm going to disagree with you on a few points:\n\n&gt; 1. being able to distribute as a single file. not entirely sure this is important but feel it's possible it is important\nI would like to point out that Flash _was not that different._ \nIn theory you could just \"play a swf\" file directly, but nobody did that. You still had to host a website with an HTML file (and probably a CSS file), and embed the swf file. And the user had to download or update their flash player on a regular basis.\nIn fact, nobody did that either! They uploaded their swf to Newgrounds, who did all the hosting work for them. The key here is the marketplace (Newgrounds).\n\nThat's not much different than the JS\/WASM, HTML, CSS combo we have today. It's not really just \"one file\"...\nAn important part of the equation was that Newgrounds did a lot of that hosting work for you as a content creator.\nThere is no reason the same kind of thing couldn't be done for WASM or modern JS. In fact, that's what <http:\/\/itch.io|itch.io> and Pico-8 are doing!\n\nI would also like to point out that _you can embedd assets_ in the WASM binary!\nModern assets like 3D models and bitmap textures are also very different from Vector based assets (I will talk more about this below).\n\nThe key is that there was a convenient way to get from the content creation tool to the hosting site easily. That's a really good point!\nI just want to point out that there is nothing technologically preventing us from building something just as convenient today, it just hasn't been built yet...\n\n&gt; being able to stream the assets from that single file vs having to wait for the entire file to download. If 1 is important than so is this.\nI am actually not sure what you mean by _stream_ assets. It's been a long time since I programmed with flash (I did back in the day, but it was a looong time ago), but I'm pretty sure it didn't \"stream\" anything, at least not in the modern sense of sending bytes over a network a little bit at a time. Youtube didn't even exist until 2005, and when Youtube started, streaming technology was still pretty bad... If I'm wrong, please give me a source and correct me.\n\nI _think_ what you mean is compression. Flash was good at compression. It also had good \"time to first interaction\" latency. I totally agree that \"time to first interaction\" is super important and extremely under appreciated with modern computers. It's a big pet peeve of mine (and anyone who follows Jon Blow, Casey Muratori, and the handmade philosophy).,\n\nI would like to point out the Flash assets were almost entirely vector based. Vectors compress extremely well! They are just control points for a Bezier curve equation.\nThe internet also had much less bandwidth during the height of Flash, so in general the assets were smaller.\nI remember Flash animations that had a lot of bitmap assets instead of vectors. You got loading screens just as bad as today (worse in some cases).\n\nThe situation is actually better today for the end user from the tech standpoint. The internet has orders of magnitude more bandwidth, and the browser apis let us do actual proper streaming of data (through js download requests or websockets).\n\n&gt; working well on mobile in the browser (this is only semi-possible because Apple has so far refused to implement the needed APIs. In particular the fullscreen API so a webpage can go fullscreen (or close to it ) like a native app can and the orientation API so a webpage can force landscape view. Android Chrome\/Firefox has had both of these for 6+ years and it hasn't ruined the browsing experience there.\nYeah. Modern Apple sucks. I agree. lol\n\n&gt; A well designed non-programmer friendly app for making things\n&gt; It wasn't just that the tech existed. It's that there was an app that let people easily use tech to make stuff.\nI think you make a really good point here. I would add that it's not just about the content creation app, but also the hosting and distribution sites like Newgrounds. Newgrounds was a \"proto-app-store\" in many ways.\n\n&gt; It could also be though the flash was just something that happened and it's time has passed.\nYou might be right here. It seems like the big game engines like Unity, and the proprietary app stores, both on mobile and desktop, have taken over the hole left by Flash.",

Vectors compress extremely well! They are just control points for a Bezier curve equation.\nThe internet also had much less bandwidth during the height of Flash, so in general the assets were smaller.\nI remember Flash animations that had a lot of bitmap assets instead of vectors. You got loading screens just as bad as today (worse in some cases).\n\nThe situation is actually better today for the end user from the tech standpoint. The internet has orders of magnitude more bandwidth, and the browser apis let us do actual proper streaming of data (through js download requests or websockets).\n\n"

Some \"app-store\" or \"marketplace\" like system that is integrated with the creation tool to provide creators with low friction content distribution and hosting.\nThe technology to build all of this exists today imo, but:\nIs there a place in the modern web (or modern computers in general if we include mobile devices) for such a platform?\nDoes it make sense to tie it to the web given the rise of mobile computing and politics like Apple's walled garden?",

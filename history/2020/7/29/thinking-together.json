It is knowable, sometimes objective and academic political thinking accumulates and spreads over time.\n\nSo for us, who already have a world of things to do and think about, it is not a world we can really participate in. But if we take it as true that we interact with political research, theory, and philosophy indirectly, I think we owe it to ourselves to try.\n\nThis can’t be done by trying to get everyone to discuss thousands of papers, research, blog posts and articles so it seems the best thing we can do as a community is focus directly on facilitating and understand the hard work others are doing.\n\n_If I were to start this thread again the above is maybe where I’d start._",

Hopefully it shows that we share many of the same political goals, and that I'm not averse to discussing capitalism here. I've expressed similar sentiments to yours in the past in this group, about the need to discuss the context software is embedded in. Another recent thread that you may like is <https:\/\/futureofcoding.slack.com\/archives\/C5T9GPWFL\/p1595017818433700>\n\n<@UJBAJNFLK> my reaction to independent bodies auditing code is twofold:\n* Ugh, that'll squeeze out all that's new and great about software.\n* That'll never never work, because software is changing too fast, and auditors will always lag auditees in knowhow.\nPerhaps my opinion is colored by only having experienced regulation in India and the US.",

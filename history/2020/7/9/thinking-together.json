Beginner tutorials have much better virality because of their wider appeal, and there's some luck involved. However, there are some ideas about jq I want to write about to finish up my \"mastering jq\" series. After this, I'll try writing some basic tutorials to various unix commands (sed, xargs, grep, etc.) and see if other people find them more valuable. It's a lot more fun to write about advanced techniques, but as JZ said, \"If skills sold, truth be told, I'd probably be lyrically Talib Kweli. Truthfully I want to rhyme like Common Sense (but I did 5 mil). I ain't been rhyming like Common since\"",

That means what you're designing will be a peer to a traditional general purpose programming languages, whereas most visual languages currently aren't even designed to be that powerful.\n\nBut what you can't do _within_ C or Java is change their semantics. You can't change the way code is executed, not without changing the compiler\/interpreter (at which point, you're no longer making a typical C or Java program that'd work with any C compiler or JVM). You can't turn C into a lazy evaluated language. At best, you can use C to create a new language that is lazy evaluated.\n\nAn example in a hypothetical visual language where code is tree-structured would be: can you, working entirely within the language, decide whether execution is \"pushed\" from the root node down, reevaluating every node as it goes, or whether execution is \"pulled\", starting from a leaf and evaluating back up to the root?\n\nAnother example — a visual programming environment in which you can define the \"grammar\" and how it's parsed. So you could build an execution strategy that makes use of color, or that makes use of proximity, or that makes use of the fineness of detail. You aren't saying \"round boxes represent files\", but rather \"roundness of corners is a semantic detail, so whenever a corner is rounded, here's how to interpret that\". For instance, you could say that shapes should be evaluated in order of roundness: circles come first, roundrects second, and boxes last.\n\nAnother example — a node-and-wire environment where you can control whether edges simply associate something on one end with something on the other end (as like a function call), or mutably remove a value from storage on one side and insert it into storage on the other side (as like an inbox\/outbox), or are themselves mutable storage (as like a queue).\n\nI think what you've described is a big improvement on what currently exists.

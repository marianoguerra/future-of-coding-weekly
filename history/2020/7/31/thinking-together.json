Communities with a good CoC have in them a recognition of such power dynamics, since that's what the CoC would have emerged from. Surveillance is a tool that reinforces and entrenches similar power imbalances in the broader public sphere — so it'd make sense for the folks who write these CoCs, who have this sensitivity to power, to want to do what they can to protest surveillance. To me, the tweet makes perfect sense and I completely see the connection.\n\nThe question becomes, what can those CoC-authoring, power-levelling folks do about the problem of their work being coopted for <https:\/\/futureofcoding.slack.com\/archives\/C5T9GPWFL\/p1595686084036400|evil>?\n\nThat might seem like an irrelevant matter. If so, you probably first need to decide how you feel about power imbalances in general.\n\nIt might seem like an intractable problem. Well, computing cultures through history are full of people making great efforts, some more successful than others, to address these exact sorts of issues. Decentralization, copyleft, FOSS, ubiquitous CoCs, the startup model, torrenting, tor, hacking, C3, the list goes on and on. I think it's totally within the realm of possibility that if a community like Rust wanted to take a stand against surveillance, or the military-industrial complex, folks within that community (or adjacent to it, or intersecting with it) might birth such a movement that produces a new counterculture.",

Communities with a good CoC have in them a recognition of such power dynamics, since that's what the CoC would have emerged from. Surveillance is a tool that reinforces and entrenches similar power imbalances in the broader public sphere — so it'd make sense for the folks who write these CoCs, who have this sensitivity to power, to want to do what they can to protest surveillance. To me, the tweet makes perfect sense and I completely see the connection.\n\nThe question becomes, what can those CoC-authoring, power-levelling folks do about the problem of their work being coopted for "

If so, you probably first need to decide how you feel about power imbalances in general.\n\nIt might seem like an intractable problem. Well, computing cultures through history are full of people making great efforts, some more successful than others, to address these exact sorts of issues. Decentralization, copyleft, FOSS, ubiquitous CoCs, the startup model, torrenting, tor, hacking, C3, the list goes on and on. I think it's totally within the realm of possibility that if a community like Rust wanted to take a stand against surveillance, or the military-industrial complex, folks within that community (or adjacent to it, or intersecting with it) might birth such a movement that produces a new counterculture."

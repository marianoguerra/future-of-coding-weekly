If they don’t want to have a power brick then they should build a little tiny motorized recharge your module that runs around and charges each of the blinks while the game is on. watching a little robot run around and charge the modules would be very entertaining. But if they think that replacing 40 batteries on a constant basis is fun they sure don’t know the toy business very well. Nintendo was the first company to select ARM chips for a portable gaming unit. They made the Nintendo GameBoy Run for 20 hours on a single AA battery, that was a really good design. that’s a lot of playtime. But when you have 40 independent battery powered pieces the chance that one of them is running low becomes very high and therefore you’re constantly interrupted by charging.\n\nNintendo got really rich because they understood electronic child immobilization was an extremely valuable thing for parents. The parents gladly excepted the inexpensive AA battery as a trade off for 20 hours of entertainment. ",

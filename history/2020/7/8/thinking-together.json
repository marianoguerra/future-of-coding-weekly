(Go with me here — resist the urge to treat this as a multidimensional space.)\n\nIn the center, we have projects that resemble typical programming languages. These tools are designed with particular semantics that the programmer will employ to structure their problem solving. They are general purpose. They don't have much regard for the particular kinds of problems being solved. This is your Java, Clojure, Vulkan, brainfuck, etc.\n\nOff to one side, you have programming tools that have both tightly defined semantics and a focus on solving particular kinds of problems. These are specialized. This is Excel, Notion, Max\/MSP, OpenGL, bash, etc.\n\nOff to the other side, we have programming tools that, while they still have semantics, don't expect you to work entirely within those semantics. They have even less regard for the problem domain. These are tools that expect you to first build some new tools from or within them, then solve your problem with those tools. This is Racket, and arguably REST, RDF, stored procedures in a DB, and other things.\n\nNow my question: are you building an FoC project that falls into the latter category? If so, talk about that a bit. What's the rationale?",

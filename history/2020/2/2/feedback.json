        "text": "by adding twice as many buttons (and using each button 3 times via 2 different SHIFT keys), TI blew HP out of the market with easier programming, and larger feature set. RPN is like FORTH; once you know it, it is actually preferable as it is elegant, not needing parentheses; but it requires more mental gymnastics to be performed. So it isn't hard to imagine the unwashed masses loving TI.  Interestingly PostScript also uses RPN.  And one can see that PostScript is not used much as an explicit programming language today, so one could say that the public has voted with their feet, and rejected RPN as requiring too much short term memory, as one cannot read RPN code unless you mentally track what is on the stack. FORTRAN\/Algol wins again, because it more closely matches traditional algebraic notation.  One can also say that the programming public has rejected excessive parenthetical notations like LISP uses. I believe it is also rejecting syntaxes that require the reader to know how many arguments are used by a function. There are some languages where you say func x y z but you don't know how many are going to be absorbed by the function. This implies memorization of each functions argument list number; that is a burden for those in the audience that cannot easily remember arbitrary things like parameter lists.  How much one has to memorize to program in a language is a major factor in usability. In some languages like Java, there is a staggering burden related to the API's that are available. Just knowing which of the 10,000 API library routines you could call is probably the largest area sub-section in its learning curve.",

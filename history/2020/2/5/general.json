        "text": "&gt; Is it not the case that property-based testing gives you that same information?\nThere's an overlap but not quite. I mean specifically abstract interpretation (property testing does actual execution with a large number of inputs).\n\nFor example, if you have a chunk of untyped Python code you can informally reason about the types of values flowing around by reading and simulating in your head. An abstract interpreter (pytype) will actually evaluate the code in terms of types (not values) and can show you the predicted types of various parameters and locals. It can get much further than mental simulation, because it can evaluate much larger chunks of the code. Technically this might belong in formal reasoning, which the paper mentions in the following paragraph:\n&gt; The bottom line is that allways of attempting to understand a system have their limitations (and this includes both informal reasoning— which is limited in scope, imprecise and hence prone to error — as well as formal reasoning— which is dependent upon the accuracy of a specification)\nI think the abstract interpretation approach could be extended so you \"feed in scenarios\", e.g. the user says \"what if the local `a` here is an integer between 0 and 1000 and `b` is an empty list\" and the system does abstract interpretation (specifically one execution and *not* 1000 different executions) to find other properties of an execution under that scenario - dead code, exceptions, and notes  \"`c` will be `a+20` \" etc.\n\nA more apt name for this kind of approach might be *computer aided reasoning* - we're not reading static code on paper and we're not writing complex types and have the system prove something, but we're simply asking targeted questions. I'd love to ask the system \"show me why this dependency is invoked when this kind of request arrives\" and then follow up by zooming into a part of the abstract execution trace. A related idea is \"program slicing\" - point to a value and have the computer tell you the subpart (slice) of the program that affects that variable. I think these are all good ideas to make state trackable, a different angle than going state-free and aiding informal reasoning.\n\nEven with the most 'readable' code, I'll note that reading doesn't scale very far - how much can you read in a day anyway? We might climb out of a small tar pit only to fall into a larger one. But targeted questions in a query language might be able to handle very large programs and even large systems with multiple programs! They'd have to be built using a model that is designed for something like this and scales up.",

I'd love to ask the system \"show me why this dependency is invoked when this kind of request arrives\" and then follow up by zooming into a part of the abstract execution trace. A related idea is \"program slicing\" - point to a value and have the computer tell you the subpart (slice) of the program that affects that variable. I think these are all good ideas to make state trackable, a different angle than going state-free and aiding informal reasoning.\n\nEven with the most 'readable' code, I'll note that reading doesn't scale very far - how much can you read in a day anyway? We might climb out of a small tar pit only to fall into a larger one. But targeted questions in a query language might be able to handle very large programs and even large systems with multiple programs! They'd have to be built using a model that is designed for something like this and scales up."

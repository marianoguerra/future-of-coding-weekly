It sold millions of copies, back in a time when there were only a few million computers - no title today has anywhere near that percentage penetration. It was built using hypercard, and 8-bit graphics, and was a puzzle game where nobody dies and there were no sprites. Anyway there is a wonderful interview with the co-developer of Myst, well worth listening to IMHO.  "

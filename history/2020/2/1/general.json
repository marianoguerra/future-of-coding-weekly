In the post I describe how the programming model emerges from geometric primitives, the inspirations behind the editor GUI, the design of the time travel capability, and end with a problem that emerged from the intersection of two of my favorite features. I welcome feedback about both the design of Hest and the problem I'm currently grappling with, plus the blog post itself. I do a lot of writing but not a lot of blogging so suggestions about how to better utilize the medium, or places where you lose the thread of thought, would be lovely. Thanks!",

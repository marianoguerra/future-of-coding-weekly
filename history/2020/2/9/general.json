I haven't seen this yet, but it seems worth exploring.\n\nAlso, you're right that BP can seem quite useful if you imagine the best possible scenario. But that doesn't seem how it's being sold. It seems to be sold as a methodogical silver bullet. Just use it and all problems become easy. If they instead said, \"if used well it will help\" I'd be much more amenable.\n\n*Exhibit A* _\"What if we could make changes or understand how complex systems work without having to read and maintain an artifact.\"_ (OP, 3:34) This seems wildly overblown. You still have to maintain the artifact. Especially if you want the desired model to be a linear\/affine combination of the input behaviors. Because there are certainly many more combinations of behaviors that lead to spaghetti than not.\n\nI had a conversation with Luca Matteis a month ago (<https:\/\/twitter.com\/lmatteis\/status\/1204862635537252352>) where we chatted a bit about my layers as compared to BP. I'm careful not to claim my layers always help. It takes taste to decompose programs into layers the right way. Even so, BP seems to lack one thing layers provide: intermediate combinations are useful, and functionality grows in a monotonic way. What happens to a BP program if you take out one behavior? Is it still legal? Easy to reason about? Useful? I haven't seen anybody answer these questions.\n\n*Exhibit B* Here's a less technical description of BP by the creator: <http:\/\/www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il\/~harel\/papers\/LiberatingProgramming.pdf>. It seems _incredibly_ overblown. We discussed it back in Dec 2018, but that's way beyond the visible window of this forum. Here's a comment I wrote there about it.\n\n---\n\n&gt; ...current methods for dealing with programming the dynamics of reactivity, however powerful and convenient, suffer from the same woes: We sit in front of a screen and write (or draw) programs that prescribe the behavior for each of the relevant parts of the system over time. Then we must check\/test\/verify that the combined behavior of all the parts satisfies a separately specified set of requirements or constraints. ... There is no need for separate specifications for the operational tasks and the requirements thereof. Anything that falls inside the total sum of what has been played-in will be a legal behavior of the system. \nI'm still wrapping my head around this vision, but I think it's ignoring the essential complexity of programming. On a fundamental level programmers deal with non-linear building blocks; interactions between constraints can be hard to imagine ahead of time. How would you gain confidence that you've \"played-in\" a project sufficiently to work out possible constraints?\n\nAdmittedly we have trouble doing this with existing systems. But surely we need to pay _more_ attention to constraints, not less. Representing actions physically makes it more difficult to survey all actions entered so far, the scenarios they apply in, etc.\n\nCheck\/test\/verify is the _fundamental_, irreducible core of programming. Trying to eliminate it is a fool's errand.\n\nLSC (the original Behavioral Programming system) introduces the notion of \"play-in\" to describe scenarios and how the system should react to them. So there'll be a natural tendency for the number of scenarios and handlers to grow. It's unclear to me how the opposite dynamic of _generalizing scenarios_ happens. How does the system encourage noticing that two scenarios are special cases of a single one and may be coalesced? How does the programmer\/user replace two played-in scenarios with a single new one? Without supporting this countervailing operation, the whole system will descend into monotonically complexifying spaghetti.\n\n---\n\nBased on this quote, I don't think BP started out envisioning model-checking. If they've since started to do so, I'd appreciate recent papers.",

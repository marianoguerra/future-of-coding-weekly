When they learned programming that was the only UI for computers, and they thought hard about how to create a better UI for programming — a UI for the power of making computers do anything you want them to, not limited to any specific domain.\n\nBut commercialization forcefully shifted incentives towards less generic and more domain specific solutions. It was much easier to sell a program for spreadsheets. And one for text processing. And one for presentations. It was easier to sell because it was easier to see what specific problem these programs solved. And it was easier to use because you’d only have to know about that particular problem domain. And it was easier to build as you cut down complexity significantly and no longer had to try to make everything possible, but just a slice of a much smaller problem space.\n\nIt’s so easy to fall into the trap of specializing too early too quickly, losing that generality early in the process. Systems like Smalltalk that some of us admire kept that generality alive in the system by representing many things with just a few powerful concepts. It wasn’t just that everything was an object, it was also that almost everything was represented by almost the same kind of object.\n\nToday, we often want to get rid of too much generality as quickly as possible and favor distinguishing things from each other so we know what we’re dealing with. Life gets so much easier if you know exactly what you’re dealing with. And that’s when we end up with specific data structures representing specific things in specific apps solving specific problems (and specific people with their specific backgrounds making specific design decisions) — isolated universes. And so we spend most of our time writing algorithms to convert between them to make them work together again.\n\nWhen we start representing a specific thing in our code, we take that power away from our user who will now have to live with that thing as we designed it. The solution can’t be to design all the possible things for them individually — what we are clearly trying very hard currently. What we need to do is to give our users as few things as possible, just enough so they can design whatever it is they need to get their job done.",

Or in other words, when all my experience was game dev I had a similar opinions (GC is shit, memory allocation should be avoided at all costs, languages far from the metal suck, ...)  and that it took getting out of game dev to accept that each thing has their place.\n\nAs one example back when JAI (his language) started he mentioned he didn't care about memory errors because he doesn't make those kinds of bugs. I nodded in agreement when I read that. But, thinking about it more I'm just guessing most games he worked on first off have to only deal with a limited number of situations compared to many other apps, and are coded by a fairly small team. Compare say to Chrome which in 2013 had at least 700 programmers working on it. You just can't expected 700 programmers to all know exactly what assumptions each other were making. You arguably need the language to help you find, prevent, enforce the very issues he doens't care about.\n\nAs another example he doesn't care about security what so ever AFAICT. About bad data allowing an app to be compromised, About sandboxing and all the things needed to make an app\/os safe from exploitation. He probably uses very few 3rd party libraries and those few he does use are *probably* trustworth. But, aruably most devs throw libs together and many of those libs do bad things (install hooks for analytics, report data they shouldn't, ...). Mobile apps on both iOS and Android seem to be full of those issues from 3rd party libs.\n\nOther examples include hating on GC and yet 10s of 1000s of games have shipped via Unity with GC (and Unreal has GC as well). That includes hit 60fps action games. Maybe you could argue hating on load times (I hate load times) but it's never affected Valve's old games all of which have horrible load pauses (Half Life, Half Life 2, Portal, etc... basically all Source Engine games)\n\nHe sees browsers as bloated (and I'm not saying they aren't to some degree) but before I worked on one I had no idea all the issues they have to deal with that I never had to deal with in games. Threats from all levels. Untrusted data everywhere, bad videos, bad jpegs, bad network requests, bad code, handling every language on the planet and many other things.\n\nHe had a rant speech someone else posted here once and in it he had these conflicting rants. He ranted that he was upset that each platform has a different GPU API. But at the same time he wants his own engine. He doesn't want to use Unreal or Unity. To put it another way, he's upset that different people have different ideas for how you should access the GPU and thinks there should be just one way but there shouldn't be just one way to make a game engine. I'd argue the 2 go hand in hand. There are muliple game engines because their are different opinions on what is best. Similarly there are mulitple GPU APIs because their are different opinions on what is best. To have one of either would require commitees to argue forever about what the one true way is and stifle innovation. By having multiple of each different teams can advance faster by not having to coordinate. Microsoft doesn't have to wait for some committee to approve a new feature. They just add what they want to DirectX and the others play catch-up. Apple doesn't have to wait for anyone else to add stuff to Metal.\n\nI could go on, like on the ridiculousness of comparing 8bit computers booting up instantly to today's machines. Yes my Atari 800, Apple II and C64 turned on immediately. They didn't connect to hard drives, sd cards, network storage. They had a 320x240 screen with max 4 bits of color. They didn't draw 100k+ international characters, didn't support infinite input devices, multiple monitors, virtual monitors over a network. They didn't multitask. Taking a step up to 80s PCs we no longer have to run QEMM to optimize how are memory is used or set dip switches on our PCI cards to allocate interrupts. That's not to say things couldn't be more optimized if you started from scratch but if you start digging through all the pieces you'll uncover why they are the way they are. Why for example it's better that there is a full computer in your hard drive and it's not just a dumb device run by your PC and why there is a negotiation for how to talk to it etc... as just one example of why todays machines are not comparible to 8bit computers and to see some kind of ideal as more like the 80s is to not really think deeply about the issue.\n\nAnyway I liked the idea of JAI optimizing for programmer joy but I don't know if JAI will actually be joyful except for people who drink his kool-aid.",

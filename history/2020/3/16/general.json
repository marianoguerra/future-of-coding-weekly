Assuming a 32-bit x86 processor and (for now) a basic third-party Unix-like kernel, Mu builds up from raw machine code to a memory-safe but less expressive language than C.\n&gt; \n&gt; Our approach to keeping software comprehensible is to reduce information hiding and abstraction, and instead encourage curiosity about internals. Our hypothesis is that abstractions help insiders who understand a project but hinder newcomers who understand only that project's domain. Where recent efforts to create ``bicycles for the mind'' have tended to focus on reducing learning time and effort, we explore organizing the curriculum to be incrementally useful, providing an hour of actionable value for an hour (or three) of study. The hope is that rewarding curiosity will stimulate curiosity in a virtuous cycle, so that more people are motivated to study and reflect on the difference between good vs bad design and good vs bad architecture, even as the study takes place over a lifetime of specialization in other domains. Spreading expertise in design is essential to the creation of a better society of more empowered citizens. Software tools have a role to play in this process, both by exemplifying good design and by providing visceral illustrations of the consequences of design choices.\nI hope to eventually do a talk for <https:\/\/2020.programming-conference.org\/home\/salon-2020>, but since it's been postponed the paper I wrote has been burning a hole in my pocket. Many thanks to <@U6KQ2S410> and the rest of the organizers for an inspiring theme this year. I didn't think anything would ever induce me to write an academic paper again.",

You can complain that open-source devs make stuff only nerdy young men can understand, or you can observe that people working for free have a limited ability to produce something polished.

As far as I'm concerned, the \"historically underrepresented people\" includes me, a white male, because I would like to shape the future of computing but can barely afford the time to do it. Of course, if I later become influential, that will be \"white privilege\", but I think this would be framed incorrectly. The problem isn't privilege, the problem is lack of privilege. We should want more people to have more privilege. But this is a political goal - a worthy goal, but is there any reason to expect the FoC group to become a political lobby?",

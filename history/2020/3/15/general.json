Also, when I said I need it to be \"C-based\", I meant the platform itself bc then it makes it easy to cannibalize\/fork to fit various end requirements of the IDE if that's not supported already. \nEx: I need to create a \"DSL Suite\" for anim graphs (think shadertoy but for animation).  Artifacts of this:\n  - A very simplified grammar for the dsl (think simplified hlsl)\n  - An IDE\n     - Needs to be standalone\n     - Needs to be embeddable insid of Unreal\n     - Needs to be embeddable inside of Maya\/Houdini\/Blender\n  - A compiler that outputs various backends: \n     - Normal C CPU code\n     - SIMD-Vectorized (think ISPC)\n     - GPU (think CUDA)\n  - A Debugger\n     - Embeddable or standalone\n     - \"Debugging\" is not just textual debugging.

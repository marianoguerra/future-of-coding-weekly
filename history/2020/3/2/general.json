In Paperts book Mindstorms he explains some interesting aspects of his vision. Later in the book he also has this example of Samba school as an example of a learning environment. I think, or at least it seems to me that she took him too \"literal\" or too constructivist - dogmatic. Which is never a good idea. I I still think Papert and his work have valuable lessons in them. But for her as for a very very very large part of society its just too much of a leap from existing culture.",

Later in the book he also has this example of Samba school as an example of a learning environment. I think, or at least it seems to me that she took him too \"literal\" or too constructivist - dogmatic. Which is never a good idea. I I still think Papert and his work have valuable lessons in them. But for her as for a very very very large part of society its just too much of a leap from existing culture."

Sugata Mitra, an education scientist, first popularized the term in 1999, referencing an approach he developed following his Hole in the Wall experiments. Mitra's experiments demonstrated that groups of kids could learn to navigate computers and the internet by themselves, and \"research since then has continued to support his startling conclusion that groups of children, with access to the Internet, can learn almost anything by themselves.\" Starting in 2014, he's worked with and through the School in the Cloud project to support the development of SOLEs around the world, adding \"Granny\" mentors and Big Questions as key components of such programs.",

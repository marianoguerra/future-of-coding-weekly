This extended many years into my professional career. And - how do I know when I “fixed” it? So terrifying.\n\n`write documentation that describes things in a different way than the names do`\nOh man; this is a hill I will die on!

        "text": "&gt; One angle I’ve homed in on is the principle that “easy-sounding things should be easy”. Programming is full of things that seem like they should be easy, but are *unnecessarily* hard in practice.\n<@U5Y7114NS> 100% agree. A few points:\n\n• In video game design, people often talk about “easy to start, hard to master”. I kinda like that approach and that’s essentially what MS Excel does. You can simulate complex stuff in Excel, but if you just want to add a bunch of numbers, create a plot, its REALLY easy to do so. Python on the other hand has like an hour of setup and a bunch of different tools and libraries to learn just to do that simple set of tasks that you can do more quickly on a piece of paper!\n• Another thing I’ll say, that Bret \/ Dynamicland people talk about a lot that I agree with … is that the fundamental REAL logic in most programs is very simple and short to express. However, bringing that to life adds the remaining 95% of code. Compatability with standards, browsers, optimizing performance, GUI, low level hardware stuff, etc. All of that is powered by brittle, complex, opaque software. I like what Bret said in an interview last year … “the real world simulates itself”, so the code for your unique logic \/ idea is very simple and minimal and can be understood and iterated on quickly. A lot of it can fit in your short-term memory (Alan Kay talks about getting things down to “a few pages of code”, which was the threshold under which even 6 year olds can program).\n&gt; Anyway, it seems like really good teaching is hard. I was really impressed with how <http:\/\/vuemastery.com|vuemastery.com> teaches Vue\nAfter 5 years in this trying to teach aliens (what I call people you can’t see :stuck_out_tongue:) technical things, I’ve come to appreciate that “learning styles”, “teaching well”, “motivating students”, and all other phrases like this are MOSTLY BS (not completely, but mostly). This is a very strong statement, but in my opinion … it fundamentally comes down to teacher-learner fit (or content-learner fit). If you’re highly motivated and have a clear goal, and the learning content or teacher is teaching towards those goals, then everything is great! The student will say things like “I like how this teacher teaches” or “this meets my learning style” … but harmony in learning + teaching goals I think explains MOST of the stories people say. This is maybe a hot take, but just my perspective :stuck_out_tongue: There’s still room for innovation though on the edges (people who are semi motivated but need to have a few aha moments delivered via fun videos or interactive simulations before they make a bigger learning commitment, etc).",

You can simulate complex stuff in Excel, but if you just want to add a bunch of numbers, create a plot, its REALLY easy to do so. Python on the other hand has like an hour of setup and a bunch of different tools and libraries to learn just to do that simple set of tasks that you can do more quickly on a piece of paper!"

However, bringing that to life adds the remaining 95% of code. Compatability with standards, browsers, optimizing performance, GUI, low level hardware stuff, etc. All of that is powered by brittle, complex, opaque software. I like what Bret said in an interview last year … “the real world simulates itself”, so the code for your unique logic \/ idea is very simple and minimal and can be understood and iterated on quickly. A lot of it can fit in your short-term memory (Alan Kay talks about getting things down to “a few pages of code”, which was the threshold under which even 6 year olds can program)."

This is a very strong statement, but in my opinion … it fundamentally comes down to teacher-learner fit (or content-learner fit). If you’re highly motivated and have a clear goal, and the learning content or teacher is teaching towards those goals, then everything is great! The student will say things like “I like how this teacher teaches” or “this meets my learning style” … but harmony in learning + teaching goals I think explains MOST of the stories people say. This is maybe a hot take, but just my perspective "

If you care about learning outcomes, the best thing is to add on a lot of things that students’ motivational investment. This is what coding bootcamps do .. they make you pay a lot of money (weeds out people who aren’t serious), they make you take a basic coding interview exam (weeds out people who aren’t serious), they’re often in person (shared struggle with other students), etc. They use the techniques universities use (old teaching methods with LOTS of carrots \/ sticks to “motivate” people). \n• If you instead care about being “innovative” in how you teach, the challenge here is that … customers don’t REALLY care about learning in some fancy new way, they just have a specific job to be done (<https:\/\/hbr.org\/2016\/09\/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done>) that’s either “I want a pay raise \/ move up in seniority in my existing job” or “I want to switch into a new career”.

You want to teach with only interactive explanations? Cool! Which learners meet their goals better b\/c of it? And btw creating interactive simulations is time consuming and expensive, which means your ‘learning rate’ from your customers is a lot slower which means your competitors that just make lots of videos … may end up solving the job in a good enough way for most students at a lower price. \n• Hopefully that didn’t come off too much like a rant :stuck_out_tongue: I guess I spent 5 years here in this space and I felt like not enough rigor was applied to thinking about the customers’ actual desires, and instead more time was spent on feel-good things like “hands on learning” (which is still cool and interesting, but insufficient!)",

[I interpret \"calculus ratiocinator\" as meaning formal language or programming language.]\n• I called what alone mattered to me the conceptual content. Hence this definition must always be kept in mind if one wishes to gain a proper understanding of what my formula language is. That, too, is what led me to the name \"Begriffsschrift\". Since I confined myself for the time being to expressing relations that are independent of the particular characteristics of objects, I was also able to use the expression \"formula language for pure thought\". That it is modeled upon the formula language of arithmetic, as I indicated in the title, has to do with fundamental ideas rather than with details of execution. Any effort to create an artificial similarity by regarding a concept as the sum of its marks was entirely alien to my thought.",

Hence this definition must always be kept in mind if one wishes to gain a proper understanding of what my formula language is. That, too, is what led me to the name \"Begriffsschrift\". Since I confined myself for the time being to expressing relations that are independent of the particular characteristics of objects, I was also able to use the expression \"formula language for pure thought\". That it is modeled upon the formula language of arithmetic, as I indicated in the title, has to do with fundamental ideas rather than with details of execution. Any effort to create an artificial similarity by regarding a concept as the sum of its marks was entirely alien to my thought."

Code and data are made of the same \"building blocks\" (structural representation) that can be inspected, edited, and executed (interpreted) directly from the live structure.\n\nAll the LIVE code for the tool itself -- including the user interface and the interpreter -- is also exposed for live editing through the same interface. You can use the tool, to completely change itself (down to the metal if you like) to work completely differently. This entire transformation can happen at runtime, without the tool ever \"stopping\".\n\nWhat I'm making is much more about this self-bootstrapping ability\/ process, than it is about a specific tool that works a specific way. Building a specific tool is only necessary in the first place, just to bootstrap this ability into existence. So the initial \"tool\" just has to be minimally capable, even if it sucks -- and from there, I'll evolve it into something better through direct manipulation.\n\nImagine a robot capable of physically modifying itself, and programmed to improve itself. Even if it's not great at that, it could improve it's ability to improve itself, or even it's criteria for reasoning about what that means. If you can somehow make that initial robot _at all_, no matter how crappy, then you've succeeded in bootstrapping arbitrarily better robots. That's what I'm trying to do, but with software &amp; programming.\n\nThere's more to it than that, which is my philosophy on \"programming language\" not needing to be a solidly defined thing, or perhaps not even a thing at all! What is a compiler or interpreter, other than just code that operates on code? Why not put THAT code and YOUR code all in the same bucket? Instead of code + compiler, you have code (in whatever form makes sense for the context) + other code that executes or translates that code?\n\nHere is where the line blurs between programming language, and having code that iterates over a hardcoded list to avoid having to repeat a bunch of code that differs only by specific values. That's as much of a \"language\" as the one your code is written in!\n\nNow take that to the extreme, but think of being able to customize your own visual representation and \/ or editor for whatever makes sense for a given context. Imagine if \"code\" could contain instructions that told your IDE how to behave? That's the same as putting your code and the code OF the IDE in the same codebase. Just like I described for removing the separation between compiler + code.\n\nOne (example) vision I have is that \"code\" for something is not a text file that you open in another tool, but a self-contained executable program that, when you run it, presents you with a custom interface \/ model for \"the code\", including the code of the whole running program &amp; interface that it presents. No more dependency on some other interface! It's the same idea (in a sense) as infrastructure as code, or HATEOS\n\nBut what's that? you need a Java program? Fine, click a button, and it spits out a compiled-to-Java equivalent of \"just the product code\". Any code in any language or for any system, has a structure, and there's no reason that cannot be stored and executed as a _live_ structural representation, prior to generating the actual \"compiled\" built product from it.\n\nWhat's that? Execution in the tool is not the same as execution in the JVM (or whatever other target)? Well, the tool is written \"in itself\", and you already made a generate-the-equivalent-Java-code functionality; use that on the tool itself, and bootstrap the tool right into the JVM (or what have you). That's one perk of having just some generic code model with self contained rules for execution or translation.\n\nThere are so so many things and approaches and models for what \"code\" could be and how to model or visualize it, how it can be edited or projected, and what to even DO with the code (e.g. translate it) ... a tool like this would make it very easy to explore that space.\n\nWhat if the representation I choose is not great? What if the tools and process I provide for molding better tools and processes, really sucks? Well, then I mold better things for molding better things.\n\nSoftware is not just made of levers; it's made of levers for making levers. And I want to put that power in everyone's hands. This makes sense not just for programmers, but also for everyone else: What the heck does it even mean to have the power of a computer in your hand, without actually having any power of a computer in your hand? What a joke!\n\nBut what if people suck at computer stuff, though? Well gosh, if only they had the power of a computer to assist with using the power of a computer...",

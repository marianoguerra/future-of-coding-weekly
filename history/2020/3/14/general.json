I feel there’s a great deal of exploration to be done even just with the theory and application of CRDTs. Logic programming gives me huge flexibility to express new ideas in terms of a single “happened before” relation. I know that building in theorem proving a la Alloy or TLA+ would help a lot too, as would interactive tools for visualizing and debugging.\nIf anyone else is exploring anything like this please let me know. I’ve only just begun."

This is really a variant of the meta idea \"make the implicit explicit\".\n\nSecond is 'data structure' oriented approaches. These are CRDTs, Datomic and such. We consider 'just data' flowing and persisted within the system and try to tag it with pseudo timestamps. We try to auto merge, query on a consistent 'view'. All data references have the psuedo timestamp. Even MVCC (and git) have this flavor - the git hash is the 'pseudo timestamp' of git data.\n\nThird is the 'system' oriented approaches - here it's not just about data but entire systems and subsystems have pseudo time. Examples are Reed's NAMOS, Jefferson's Virtual Time, the Croquet project, etc. The main difference I see here is *all messages* have the psuedo time attached. It's not just querying and modifying data, but any message between to nodes will have the pseudo time attached, which specifies which 'version' of the world the message comes from and refers to.",

This is really a variant of the meta idea \"make the implicit explicit\".\n\nSecond is 'data structure' oriented approaches. These are CRDTs, Datomic and such. We consider 'just data' flowing and persisted within the system and try to tag it with pseudo timestamps. We try to auto merge, query on a consistent 'view'. All data references have the psuedo timestamp. Even MVCC (and git) have this flavor - the git hash is the 'pseudo timestamp' of git data.\n\nThird is the 'system' oriented approaches - here it's not just about data but entire systems and subsystems have pseudo time. Examples are Reed's NAMOS, Jefferson's Virtual Time, the Croquet project, etc. The main difference I see here is "

Given Smalltalk's great age, Pharo is indeed one of the most sophisticated IDE's on the planet. However, I find smalltalk horrible, and although i tried learning it with the Adele Goldberg Smalltalk-80 book, it just seemed perverse to send the message \"plus\" to the number 2 along with a message content of 2 to add 2+2. I gave it a try, but after learning Assembler, PL\/1, FORTRAN, i must have been contaminated by the Algol family to the point where smalltalk is a no-go.",

Given Smalltalk's great age, Pharo is indeed one of the most sophisticated IDE's on the planet. However, I find smalltalk horrible, and although i tried learning it with the Adele Goldberg Smalltalk-80 book, it just seemed perverse to send the message \"plus\" to the number 2 along with a message content of 2 to add 2+2. I gave it a try, but after learning Assembler, PL\/1, FORTRAN, i must have been contaminated by the Algol family to the point where smalltalk is a no-go."

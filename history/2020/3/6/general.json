And not only that, naive users have no clue as to how to describe in proper terminology what they are trying to accomplish. So their queries will end badly. The worst systems IMHO are those that present a dark screen with no clue was to what commands or functions are available. That reminds me of a survey where programmers asked which text editor was the easiest and some nerds answered vi and emacs. Yeah, right, people love using LISP for their word processing queries. Yikes.\n\nMS won the OS game by using wizards on top of a complex dialog box tree. if you have enough wizards people don't have to learn where all the functions are buried. In this sense they were compensating for their intrinsically more complex OS than Apple offered. MS. had a lot more hardware to support; it was a practical compromise and worked rather well for them.  Apple took the tack of drastically limiting hardware options which made it possible to offer a much simpler OS interface. That split between the two companies persists, but Apple has never really been able to crack 10% market share even in their best days, due to the tradeoffs this entails.",

It is kind of nutty, to use super powerful search engine technology to fix the lack of intuitive workflow and tidy organization of functions. How does one know what is possible in such a system? it is completely undiscoverable, so I say Norman is completely incorrect.  And not only that, naive users have no clue as to how to describe in proper terminology what they are trying to accomplish. So their queries will end badly. The worst systems IMHO are those that present a dark screen with no clue was to what commands or functions are available. That reminds me of a survey where programmers asked which text editor was the easiest and some nerds answered vi and emacs. Yeah, right, people love using LISP for their word processing queries. Yikes.\n\nMS won the OS game by using wizards on top of a complex dialog box tree. if you have enough wizards people don't have to learn where all the functions are buried. In this sense they were compensating for their intrinsically more complex OS than Apple offered. MS. had a lot more hardware to support; it was a practical compromise and worked rather well for them.  Apple took the tack of drastically limiting hardware options which made it possible to offer a much simpler OS interface. That split between the two companies persists, but Apple has never really been able to crack 10% market share even in their best days, due to the tradeoffs this entails."

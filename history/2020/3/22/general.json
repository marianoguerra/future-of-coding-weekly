        "text": "Adobe sold off the air project to karman Which I believe is owned by Samsung, or some other Korean firm. And it still works, but there are some issues with web GL in regards to text entry fields. It turns out that text entry and soft keyboards are deeply intertwined to the lowest levels of the operating system, and that to do text entry in the field is more than 1 million lines of code, it’s more cold than all the rest of the Graphics Layer put together. It is in fact the single reason why operating systems are so few in quantity, you can do the whole corner of the operating system very easily as the wirth did in his Lilith machine, And there are numerous embedded machine microkernels that are very tiny. But the second you want to support Korean Japanese Chinese Thai text and put Support suddenly things get really hard. And let’s not forget about Hebrew and Arabic which are two important languages that are written right to left, and have to support switching direction and one entry field. So we have webGL will be great for presentation but Will it just fall down when it comes to having text entry That supports the tougher languages which by the way a significant fraction of the world uses. Graphic layer that doesn’t have text entry it’s going to be acceptable for video games but not for business purposes and since were talking about the virtual machine for the future of mankind it’s going to take a while for them to figure this out and I don’t think it’s gonna happen that quickly.",

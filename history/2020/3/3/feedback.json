So the canonical example they have of using writing a schema - {“type”: [“number”, “string”], “maxLength”: 4} . this validates a string of length 4 or a number (maxLength applies to just strings).\n\nAll of these kind of problems disappear with a DSL. You might ask why a new language? but i think even though json schema is written with json, you need to understand it is semantics for it to make sense just like any other language and having one designed from the ground up to support validation is better + you can always compile to native languages just like protobufs for example.",

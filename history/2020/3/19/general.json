        "text": "So there's two different things going on here:\n* Learning \"programming\" (e.g. education)\n* Learning what's in a certain codebase, or how to use a specific tool or language or framework.\n\nI'll comment on the first:\n\n\"Programming\" is usually taught in terms of learning a specific language or tool, and getting it to compile and it's nuances, etc. In other words, in terms of the second category, above. I think that's a mistake, but that's NOT what programming IS. It's just what it HAPPENS to entail right now, as currently practiced \/ implemented. How the heck can we improve on or escape from any of that is it's taught that \"programming\" is getting a Java app to build, etc.\n\nInstead, I think we need custom tools or environments or whatever, that expose the now concrete concepts of programming to be explored. This might not be an actual language, or might be very sandboxed; but the important thing is the CONCEPTS.\n\nLearning using traditional programming bloat just gets in the way. People end up focusing more on the syntax to get a Java class to compile (sometimes not even knowing yet what that even means), and the understanding of what's being programmed and what that means, is lost \/ mixed up with a ton of boilerplate and tooling that is NOT PROGRAMMING. It's very confusing for new Learners.\n\nIt's true really of any language or tool. \"Learning python\" is not learning \"programming\" -- though some of that still happens as a side effect, that's not the same thing, and it's learned in a very specific context; the student will think that they are \"learning programming\" because they've learned some python commands; they will think that's what it means to program",

I think that's a mistake, but that's NOT what programming IS. It's just what it HAPPENS to entail right now, as currently practiced \/ implemented. How the heck can we improve on or escape from any of that is it's taught that \"programming\" is getting a Java app to build, etc.\n\nInstead, I think we need custom tools or environments or whatever, that expose the now concrete concepts of programming to be explored. This might not be an actual language, or might be very sandboxed; but the important thing is the CONCEPTS.\n\nLearning using traditional programming bloat just gets in the way. People end up focusing more on the syntax to get a Java class to compile (sometimes not even knowing yet what that even means), and the understanding of what's being programmed and what that means, is lost \/ mixed up with a ton of boilerplate and tooling that is NOT PROGRAMMING. It's very confusing for new Learners.\n\nIt's true really of any language or tool. \"Learning python\" is not learning \"programming\" -- though some of that still happens as a side effect, that's not the same thing, and it's learned in a very specific context; the student will think that they are \"learning programming\" because they've learned some python commands; they will think that's what it means to program"

        "text": "I also think certain programming principles are much more important than others. Bad code typically results from violating one of the following principles that I follow:\n\n1. Separate concerns!!! A program is like a house: just as walls give a house structure, separation of concerns gives a program structure. Most programming languages do not facilitate separation of concerns because they allow almost anything to touch almost anything else. Programmer discipline is required to create imaginary walls where no connections are allowed. For example, a language typically can't stop the GUI from directly running SQL update commands, so the wall between GUI and a specific data persistence library rests only in the minds of the developers. (I think some people \"solve\" this lack of compiler enforcement with \"microservices architectures\", but any solution that involves huge amounts of otherwise unnecessary plumbing code is not a good solution.)\n2. The Generalized Don't Repeat Yourself principle: avoid not just repeating information or business logic in multiple places, but minimize repetition of any patterns whatsoever. Elegant code minimizes the number of tokens in the program.\n3. Create functions and abstractions appropriately, but avoid excessive layering\/wrapping (doing so is often motivated by prior failure to refactor, or failure to test, leading to brittle code you don't dare touch). There is an appropriate number of layers of abstraction; too many or too few is confusing (and many programs have *both* too many *and* too few, in different places).\n4. Minimize the number of code entities by merging things that turn out to be very similar. For example, I realized that \"logging\" and \"reporting warnings and errors\" are essentially the same thing, so in the <http:\/\/core.loyc.net|Loyc.Essentials >way of doing things you would use the same interface `IMessageSink` for both (sometimes I wonder if no one else has noticed this). Similarly I often see interfaces like `ISomethingRetriever` whose job is to retrieve some kind of object given some kind of key. That's basically a dictionary! Just implement `IReadOnlyDictionary`, you fool, or whatever your language's equivalent is. Do not create a new and different interface every time you need to retrieve a new kind of object. More broadly, design both your interfaces and your components to be generic, reusable, and ignorant.\n5. Pick good names and write documentation that describes things in a _different way_ than the names do. I often write documentation for a class *before* its code, which leads to clear thinking and good separation of concerns. (However I have to correct the documentation later because I usually tweak something or change plans midstream.) Documentation of large-scale entities (classes, modules) and mutable state (e.g. invariants) is often more important than documentation of small-scale entities (small functions and code blocks).\n6. Write good tests (or prove correctness)\n7. Think long and hard about your decisions. _Agonize over them._ You'll never come up with an optimal design by doing the first thing that comes to mind. Even after you implement it, be on the lookout for a better approach (either so you can use it in the future, or ideally, improve the original code).\n8. Be on the lookout for new and better general-purpose techniques, and then actually use those techniques. I am slightly irritated whenever I see professional developers using strings when they should be using <https:\/\/www.codeproject.com\/Articles\/34753\/Symbols-as-extensible-enums-2-2-2|Symbols>. Why? Do you use strings in C# because it doesn't have Symbols? But you've seen Symbols in Ruby and ES6 - take the lesson you learned in the other language and apply it to C#.\n(When I wrote this I was thinking of the question \"what events stand out as important learning points in your path to technical enlightenment?\" but now I see that, rather than answer the question, I've simply explained what I think an enlightened programmer *does*. I don't remember how I learned this stuff, but I am quite convinced of its importance.)",

The advantage of this approach would be that LES is not designed as a programming language, but rather as a foundation for building languages (especially DSLs), and so the editor could be re-used for various languages. Also, presumably while building the editor I could _figure out_ how to generalize parts of it so that those parts could be used to build WYSIWYT editors for somewhat different-looking languages... anyway, this is just a thing I'd like to do, but I might never find the time for it unless I pair up with someone, so I thought I'd mention it.

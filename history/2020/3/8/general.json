Some do! But far more people learn to cook so they can eat better, or more affordably, or in a specific way. Or because they want to carry on a tradition. Sometimes they learn just because they’re bored! Or even because—get this—they love spending time with the person who’s teaching them.\n&gt; \n<@UJKKBAMLL> This article, and this excerpt in particular, feels like a counterpoint to your messages about Roblox and (if I followed correctly) whether they can play a role in helping kids learn to code in a way that helps them make money.",

Some do! But far more people learn to cook so they can eat better, or more affordably, or in a specific way. Or because they want to carry on a tradition. Sometimes they learn just because they’re bored! Or even because—get this—they love spending time with the person who’s teaching them.\n"

And this blurp-out action has since 1984 been called “paste”.\n&gt; \n&gt; Not only did PARC take away the fundamental method of reorganization, and give us a hidey hole instead, but they gave that hidey hole the name of the previous method.

        "text": "Above i meant a fully modeled boolean has 4 states, 2 bits data store, not 4 bits.\n\nExcel has an extended arithmetic, which is carried in each cell. In Excel each cell holding a value has these 2 extra states (#UNDEF and #ERROR) so that you don't need a second cell. In a programming language, if you only allocate 1 bit for the boolean, you cannot represent these two additional states, so you then must allocate another variable to hold it. Or maybe you set it to false which is making up a possibly incorrect value (a bad thing).  A second value for tracking additional values is massively inconvenient, and would mean when you pass that value to a function you would also need to send the second parameter. Since every program is about manipulating data via code, when you start talking about type systems you are also assuming some kind of arithmetic system. Whether you like it or not, you always have these 2 extra states for every variable. You might have omitted to enter the value, or the value is derived from another value that was in error.  For example  a = sqrt(-1);  b=a*2; c = b&lt;2;  In this case, A would be ERROR, and B would evaluate to ERROR as well, and so would C. You can't claim that true or false is correct in the case of C. Yes this is a rarely encountered edge case. But if you want your program to survive erroneous or missing data, you need this extended and protected form of arithmetic. The problem i have with type discussions in this forum is the way people gloss over these exceptions. You won't bother to check every arithmetic operation for some missing data, so the correct approach is to let your arithmetic be closed, and no operation stops the program (unless you are in debugging mode). Every data type needs these base values, because strings can be missing too, and in loosely typed languages you might try to rotate a number instead of a bitmap...  since it is nonsensical, you need that error state to track this so you don't build on top of an error.\n\nHaving protected arithmetic means you won't have to do as much testing on your code, because you aren't so worried about bad inputs causing crazy behavior. Test driven design has become popular with some because they know how flabby their code is and they would prefer to more fully exercise the combinations and permutations. I say screw all that extra work on testing, just make the code impregnable and save the effort of doing exhaustive tests.\n\nNowadays with consumers running millions of copies of software, it isn't considered acceptable to crash on erroneous or missing data. Maybe it was okay back in the day where the person controlling the input data was the same person running the program, but exceptions are a terrible way to handle errors.\n\nMy assertion is that exceptions are a bad idea. You must be prepared to survive bad or missing data. You are not going to be able to figure out where all the numerical exceptions could originate, much less recover from them, and to have anything less than Excel's extended arithmetic is the wrong direction IMHO. There are too many statements in your program that do arithmetic.  Every atomic value in Beads has an error or undefined base value. JS got tantalizingly close with their undefined and NaN value sets, but not allow an Error value on booleans, nor did they consider it for strings or objects, etc.  The arithmetic in JS is asymmetrical and incomplete. This is a mathematical issue stemming from the improvement in logic that people called \"fuzzy logic\", which was popular perhaps 20 years ago, but now forgotten.",

JS got tantalizingly close with their undefined and NaN value sets, but not allow an Error value on booleans, nor did they consider it for strings or objects, etc.  The arithmetic in JS is asymmetrical and incomplete. This is a mathematical issue stemming from the improvement in logic that people called \"fuzzy logic\", which was popular perhaps 20 years ago, but now forgotten."

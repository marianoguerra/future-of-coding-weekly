        "text": "&gt; I have this feeling that I can design it in a way that doesn't need a vector clock for causal consistency\nA way to have causal consistency in an append only log, is to use a combination of a Lamport timestamp and an unique session ID, i.e. an ID unique to each site of editing. You order events based on the timestamp and when two events from two sites have the same timestamp you use the ID to choose the order in a deterministic way. It is actually what I have successfully used for my implementation of CausalTree\/CRDT. You can find more information about this here: <http:\/\/archagon.net\/blog\/2018\/03\/24\/data-laced-with-history\/>. It is a very well written article and actually it is after reading it that I work on my Rust implementation of this. Here is en excerpt, explaining the ordering of the event log:\n&gt; \"This won’t be convergent by default since the operations don’t have an inherent total order, but it’s easy to fix this by giving each one a globally-unique ID in the form of an owner UUID\n&gt;  \n&gt; plus a Lamport timestamp. (In the diagrams below, this is encoded as “SX@TY”, where “SX” represents the UUID for site X, and Y is just the timestamp.) With this scheme, no two operations can have the same ID: operations from the same owner will have different timestamps, while operations from different owners will have different UUIDs. The Lamport timestamps will be used to sort the operations into causal order, leaving the UUIDs for tiebreaking when concurrent operations happen to have the same timestamp.\" ",

With this scheme, no two operations can have the same ID: operations from the same owner will have different timestamps, while operations from different owners will have different UUIDs. The Lamport timestamps will be used to sort the operations into causal order, leaving the UUIDs for tiebreaking when concurrent operations happen to have the same timestamp.\" "

And hiding something in the clipboard has since 1984 been called “cut”. Then you choose where this one piece goes and blurp it out. And this blurp-out action has since 1984 been called “paste”.\n&gt; \n&gt; Not only did PARC take away the fundamental method of reorganization, and give us a hidey hole instead, but they gave that hidey hole the name of the previous method.

He later went to Apple to work on the Macintosh.\n\nIn TextEdit on the Macintosh, I can select some text, then drag &amp; drop the selected text to another location. It seems like this is the kind of UI that Nelson is advocating. But I generally don't use this feature, because it becomes awkward if the text has to travel a long distance, especially if I have to scroll a long distance in the document to find the destination for the text I am moving.\n\nPARC-style cut copy &amp; paste is simple, easy and works. People have implemented \"better\" systems but they always more complicated, and fail to catch on. Can you provide a link where Nelson demonstrates a better UI?",

He later went to Apple to work on the Macintosh.\n\nIn TextEdit on the Macintosh, I can select some text, then drag & drop the selected text to another location. It seems like this is the kind of UI that Nelson is advocating. But I generally don't use this feature, because it becomes awkward if the text has to travel a long distance, especially if I have to scroll a long distance in the document to find the destination for the text I am moving.\n\nPARC-style cut copy & paste is simple, easy and works. People have implemented \"better\" systems but they always more complicated, and fail to catch on. Can you provide a link where Nelson demonstrates a better UI?"

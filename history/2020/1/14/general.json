There are probably multiple aspects to provenance (e.g. version history, execution trace, ...) and I should be able to follow any path.\n\n*Permeable Layers*\nIt should be possible to see under any layer of abstraction, in a safe manner, and see how the inside corresponds to the outside.\n\n*Seamless Composition*\nWhen I compose any object A with another object B in my system, the only thing that should matter is the highest level meaning encoded in these objects. The lower level data formats should be irrelevant, adapters should materialize as necessary. This requires that objects carry within them enough information to be tied back to some higher level meaning. Have been discussing this in <https:\/\/futureofcoding.slack.com\/archives\/CCL5VVBAN\/p1577178650059300>.\n\n*Extensive Affordances*\nAll objects should expose (via API\/visual features) their abilities - labelled knobs and buttons. Not like Unix shell commands where you can't introspect them in a uniform manner to discover the flags and options. Compare with the Lisp machines (commands are functions with typed arguments, can be introspected, contextually fulfilled). Composition of objects should 'flow through' the affordances.\n\n*Universal Hypermedia*\n(Never copy paste an id again). Across the whole system, objects have resolvable ids\/links. Objects that are related hold resolvable references to each other so their visualization easily provides navigable links to the other objects. Jump from running apps to sources to authors to annotation systems with easy. Allow 'scribbling in the margins' by attaching annotations to any object. No silos.",

You are talking about taking food out of a lot of people's mouths, and unlike the tech business which thrives on disruptive changes, the legal industry is extremely conservative and will resist mightily any significant changes. Here in california, the minimum wage for a lawyer is around $350 per hour (in terms of court-ordered legal services). That's 700k\/year full time. The field does need reform, but Atrium is feeling first hand the cost of keeping all those lawyers on full salary, while their billable hours were obviously insufficient to cover it. The advantage of the existing system, is a lawyer can dream about your case and bill you, while a service like Atrium with its flat fee model was not able to take advantage of that."

I’m just trying to refine my understanding of the situation with events and share what I thought might be a useful perspective. \n\nI didn’t really think one of us is arguing for and the other against something, and that we’re just talking about different aspects. I was looking more at the “Why?” and you seem to be more about the “Now What?” — both equally interesting questions, I think.\n\nTotally agree with your assessment of what’s wrong with the lecture format and wish we find something better. I even tried several times and came up with something that seems to work for those who went through the experience, but misses all the necessary ingredients to get people to try it in the first place (those who did were practically all friends who just went with “oh, sure, I’ll come to your event because I trust you to do something interesting”). If we had offered classic lectures and perhaps one or two famous speakers, it would’ve been much easier to convince other people to come (and perhaps even spend money on it).

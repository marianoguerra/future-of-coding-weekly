                "text": "Try it yourself: Google &ldquo;how to check for empty string.&rdquo; I got about 16 million results. How can something that seems so straightforward lead to so many questions and probably even more answers?\nThe solution differs by language, but most answers will look similar to this:\nif string != null and string.length() &gt; 0 {\n    ...\n}\nWhy can we not simply say?\nif string is filled {\n    ...\n}\n(pseudocode, forget about the exact syntax)\nIf you think the first form is good enough, just pick one of the answers for your favorite language and stick with it. If you&rsquo;re interested in the future of programming languages, as I am, read on.\nHopefully, your language of choice already supports some sort of shortcut to check for an empty string. But it probably still has two distinct representations for an empty string, which can confuse all of us from time to time:\nthe value null (maybe written as nil, none, etc.)\na string of length zero\nStrings are one of the most common data structures we pass around in our programs, so you would expect programming languages to have solved this &ldquo;&rdquo; versus null issue by now. Unfortunately, even newcomer Swift, although quite articulated about optional versus mandatory values, doesn&rsquo;t provide any solutions in this regard. Swift gives us optional values. But even if you define a Swift string to be optional you still have to deal with two representations for an empty string: either &ldquo;&rdquo; or nil. So you still have to check for both situations. Even worse, if you define a string to be mandatory it can still be empty!\nIf you think the distinction between a string of length zero and a null value has any significant meaning, please tweet or email me or write your real-world example below. Things are either present or they are not. A user will either enter a value in a given field or keep it empty. A function returns a result or it doesn&rsquo;t. A value in a database is either there or not. There&rsquo;s typically nothing in between.\nTime Waster\nWe can waste a lot&nbsp;of time on this issue:\nYou&rsquo;re never 100% sure what it is wise to return from a function in the case of no result.\nYou always have to check for both situations, just to be sure.\nYou can forget one of the two checks, resulting in unnecessary bugs.\nThe extra code obscures the pure intention of an empty or not-empty check.\nNot convinced? Check out: \nHistory\nLet&rsquo;s see how we got into this mess, because there is some history behind it.\nIn older programming languages like COBOL, strings were typically fixed sized. Coming from a world of punch cards and tapes, that made a lot of sense. However, because variable sized strings are more flexible, they eventually became the standard. Strings now had to be allocated on the heap. That&rsquo;s because variable sized values are inconvenient on the stack and impossible inside fixed record structures. From then on it became possible to represent an empty string by not allocating anything on the heap (null) in addition to the possibility of assigning zero characters (&ldquo;&rdquo;) to the string.\nObject-oriented programming languages eventually turned these allocated strings into objects, giving them methods to handle and manipulate their content. Compare that to other value types like integers, floats, and booleans, which were typically kept as native as possible. That&rsquo;s because making them into heap-allocated objects would mean a more-than-significant performance penalty.\nBelieve me, it is not intentional that we are stuck now with two representations for empty strings. It was just born out of technical necessity. That may be fine in a language like C. But hey, it is 2017 now &ndash; we can do better. Remember the trouble with ending strings using a &lsquo;\\0&rsquo; character. Exactly!\nWhy Strings are Values\nIn the theory of entities, attributes and relationships (EAR-modeling) entities and relationships are there to register facts. Values (assigned to attributes) play an entirely different role. While we can refer to entities using something like a record-ID, values reference from the model back to the outside world. To take some examples, a name can be a reference to a person, a date value refers to an abstract value on a calendar, and numbers refer to a virtual number scale. Given this definition, strings are also values (1). And therefore it makes sense to expect so-called value semantics for strings too.\nOf course, a string is a sequence of characters. And, you could argue, that makes them totally different from numbers. But remember that numbers are also sequences of symbols (digits in this case). The only difference is that we can fit most numbers within 32 of 64 bits. For that reason we don&rsquo;t need to allocate them in separate memory structures like we do with strings. But that is not an adequate reason to say that strings are not values.\nIt&rsquo;s interesting to compare the theoretical definition of values with the typical implementation of strings and integers in many popular programming languages.\n\nValues\/attributes (theory)\nIntegers\nStrings\nSharable\nNo\nNo\nYes, although we try to prevent this\nSupport for optionality\nYes\nNo, in many languages\nYes, but typically in two ways (&ldquo;&rdquo; and null)\nAssignment behavior\nValue itself is copied\nValue itself is copied\nDepending on the language\nComparison behavior (equals)\nValues are compared\nValues are compared\nDepending on the language and operator (equals(), ==, ===)\n&nbsp;\nThe last column says it all. Strings being wrapped as objects may have benefits, but it gives them &ldquo;entity&rdquo; behavior. And languages have been struggling with this for decades now. Hence the introduction of band-aid features like const, final, immutability, etc.\nThe fact that we have two ways of representing empty strings is even weirder when you consider that in some languages intrinsic values such as integers, floats, etc., cannot represent an empty value. That&rsquo;s why a lot of code uses value 0 or -1 to present an empty integer field, which, again, can lead to bugs because both could actually be valid values.\nThe Solution\nWe do not have to look far for solutions. Just two examples (sorry if I forgot your language of choice):\nThe Oracle VARCHAR2 type automatically converts every instance of &ldquo;&rdquo; into NULL. This guarantees that there is only one way an empty string can be represented.\nString classes in C++ typically cannot be NULL because their instances are not pointers by themselves.\nI can imagine a more conceptual approach toward strings and values in general. We can forbid const values like &ldquo;&rdquo; because they have no meaning. Isn&rsquo;t that the same as the fact that we cannot write integer constants with zero digits?\nIf you&rsquo;re developing a programming language, consider what fits your language style. But my main takeaways would be:\nUnderstand that strings are values just like integers, dates, etc.\nGo for value semantics, even if you like them to have object-like methods.\nPlease, please, prevent the situation of having two different values for empty strings.\nSupport optionality for every type of value (I would like to credit Swift for that)\nThe bottom line is to avoid too many technical considerations when designing a language. Let the compiler do the hard work.\nReferences\n1) Very long strings like the text of a document should maybe not be regarded as &ldquo;values.&rdquo; But that&rsquo;s a different subject.\nCredits\nR.

My point is that it may not be appropriate to try to encode too much meta data (as we might be tempted to do with an empty string) into a value. Most languages and object systems lack abstractions around this, and end up scattering this meta info in difficult to work with ways throughout the code. Databases have similar problems."

That’s not surprising because whenever we have ambiguity, it usually leads to exceptions, crashes, undefined behavior, or hard to track down bugs.\n\nAs a consequence we came up with a solution: get rid of ambiguity. We introduced more specific types that make the formerly ambiguous cases explicit and\/or limit the possible values to those we know to work with only. We added type checkers that prevent us from compiling ambiguity into our programs.\n\nSo now, if your function needs two integers to work, it only works with integers. If you have a string “5” and want to stick it in there, you’ll need another function that’s been specifically designed to convert a string into an integer, which includes a “not possible” scenario and so you’re forced to deal with that scenario. That’s all great and clearly works better than what we had before.\n\nSometimes I wonder if that “let’s make everything more explicit” solution was maybe not the best one and we should’ve thought more into the opposite direction, about how we can keep the ambiguity, but figure out better ways to deal with it.\n\nAfter all, humans deal with ambiguity quite well. If you read this post and you don’t know what “ambiguity“ means, your comprehension process doesn’t crash and you can finish reading the whole post just fine. You’re even trying to make sense of what it could mean based on the context. Or you can look it up later and then it probably makes sense without you having to read the whole post again.\n\nI think this is also something that makes programming hard to learn — we’re not used to having to make everything explicit. Most of the world works just fine with lots of ambiguity. Sure, sometimes that approach causes problems too, but look how far we got with it.",

        "text": "<https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=K4DlqsxdOfY&amp;t=4212>\n\nThere's a new glitch that was discovered in Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time a few months ago, which was exhibited live as part of the Games Done Quick speedrunning charity marathon last week. This glitch is an incredible feat of both reverse engineering and virtuosic game input, and the commentators do a good job of explaining what happens. For those who aren't gamers this might not carry much significance, but for anyone who plays games in general or Ocarina of Time in particular this should be a real head trip.\n\nThis category of speedrun is \"100% no source requirement\", which means the runner needs to acquire every single item in the game, but that item doesn't need to be acquired from its original source. This glitch is the skeleton key that unlocks every item in the game.\n\nAll the below is explained better by the video, so if you're interested you should watch that instead of reading this.\n\nIn summary, the glitch works by abusing the boomerang, a chest, and water. There's a deku scrub that gives Link a heart. ZFG (the player) collects that heart with the boomerang. The boomerang \"moves\" the heart by copying the boomerang's position to the heart's position every frame. Through a series of very careful inputs, ZFG causes the game to unload the heart from memory while it's being boomeranged, and load something else (Zelda's Letter) in its place, causing the boomerang to write position values on that object instead. ZFG then causes a room with a chest to load exactly when the boomerang is in a very precise position, so that the chest ends up containing the item being carried by the boomerang. This item is normally never found inside a chest, so when Link collects this item from the chest, the game actually ends up giving Link a _different_ item — and which item Link receives is determined by the angle (in 256th increments) Link is facing. By repeatedly going out bounds, dying, and being revived by a fairy, ZFG tricks the game into thinking Link is underwater when he's not, and is able to collect multiple specific items from the chest.\n\nNo way in hell would I post this to <#C5T9GPWFL|general> :P",

This glitch is an incredible feat of both reverse engineering and virtuosic game input, and the commentators do a good job of explaining what happens. For those who aren't gamers this might not carry much significance, but for anyone who plays games in general or Ocarina of Time in particular this should be a real head trip.\n\nThis category of speedrun is \"100% no source requirement\", which means the runner needs to acquire every single item in the game, but that item doesn't need to be acquired from its original source. This glitch is the skeleton key that unlocks every item in the game.\n\nAll the below is explained better by the video, so if you're interested you should watch that instead of reading this.\n\nIn summary, the glitch works by abusing the boomerang, a chest, and water. There's a deku scrub that gives Link a heart. ZFG (the player) collects that heart with the boomerang. The boomerang \"moves\" the heart by copying the boomerang's position to the heart's position every frame. Through a series of very careful inputs, ZFG causes the game to unload the heart from memory while it's being boomeranged, and load something else (Zelda's Letter) in its place, causing the boomerang to write position values on that object instead. ZFG then causes a room with a chest to load exactly when the boomerang is in a very precise position, so that the chest ends up containing the item being carried by the boomerang. This item is normally never found inside a chest, so when Link collects this item from the chest, the game actually ends up giving Link a "

All type systems I know impose a single type structure on \"everything\", typically meaning \"a program\", which is a somewhat arbitrarily defined subsystem of a computing system.\nEvery type system I have seen is great for some use cases and horrible for others. So either we need to find the one type system that's good for everything, or admit that we need different type systems and find a way to make them collaborate."

In something like RDF, or any graph model there is only one (obvious) way to model the car-wheel relationship: there's a car, there's a wheel, there's a 1:many relationship between car and wheels.\n\nWhen using record types, you have to partition the information into two records - now you must decide where the link goes. This is what I mean by the 'relationship should be outside the entity' but it is inside in records. Sometimes I might want to lookup the car for a given wheel. Now I have a few options: Loop over all the cars and see if they contain this wheel, construct a reverse mapping using a new data structure `Dict[Wheel, Car]`. If you do that and it's somewhat long lived, you now have to keep the data consistent. The point is your code is not written to fit the domain model but it is written to fit this type model that contains various projections of the domain model. Importantly these projections are manually constructed and maintained. Other concerns (such as optimization) might lead to decisions like lets keep both `car.wheels` and `wheel.car` because we need fast lookup in both directions.",

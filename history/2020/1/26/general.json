So if the word in your program in some language was 3.14, the parser might assign it to the type *π* which extends from float which extends from numeric which extends from any. So in a type cube visualization it me be a stack of tiles with 3.14 on top, underneath would be a tile with *π,* then float, then numeric, then any. So the stack would be 5 tiles high. Now if your language didn't have the concept of numbers at all and perhaps was just strings, that stack would only be 2 high (3.14 and any).

I have several distinct clusters of interests, which I switch between when working on hobby projects. I can only focus on one top priority at a time, so eg my artistic output plummets when I am sprinting on compiler optimization or language design. Within each cluster I think I could prioritize. I accept that this makes me a lousy business person. P.S. I don't think that everybodies brains are necessarily wired in the same way, with respect to things like only having one passion."

Thus, Stiegler’s main line of argument suggests that as we can experience a melody multiple times, and our experience of that melody changes depending on the multitude of times we experience it, we must therefore have a form of technical retention, or ‘tertiary retention’ in which the repeatability of a temporal object becomes possible. Our primary retention is also therefore dependant on both the secondary and tertiary forms of retention. By Matt Bluemink.",

Well maybe not so much unseen as deliberately ignored.\nI think the key takeaway here is that technology is \/persistent\/ and has long-ranging effects. As a creator, are you willing to take responsibility for your creation? Perhaps the more important question is whether you can even do so—is it a task even capable by humans? I wonder how much of the general disregard for these questions comes out of a sense of despair?\nBut eh, I didn't really expect to be discussing philosophy here to be perfectly honest",

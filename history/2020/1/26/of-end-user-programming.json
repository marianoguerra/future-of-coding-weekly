In simpler terms, a hyponym is in a type-of relationship with its hypernym. For example, pigeon, crow, eagle and seagull are all hyponyms of bird (their hypernym); which, in turn, is a hyponym of animal.Other names for hypernym include umbrella term and blanket term. A synonym of co-hyponym based on same tier (and not hyponymic) relation is allonym (it means different name).",

I was invited to speak about Inform, past, present and future. I’d like to thank the audience, who were not all from London nor even from England, for their insightful questions. This talk assumes a little familiarity with what is sometimes called parser IF, because it was preceded by an introduction from Emily Short, who led a live play-through of part of Mike Spivey’s recent work A Beauty Cold and Austere, and showed a gallery of contemporary pieces written in this genre. — Graham Nelson",

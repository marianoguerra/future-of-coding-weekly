Modern GPUs have no problem with looping, and loops are required for general 3D fractals and noise based procedural modelling. My eventual plan is to drop support for GPU hardware that predates 2012, and migrate to a modern, cross-platform GPU API (probably WebGPU).",

Some projects may not provide containers and yet be quite parsimonious and worth using. (Like Mu :angel:)\n\nGood question about build-time dependencies. I obsess over those in Mu, but in this project I surprisingly don't immediately care about them. Assume projects distribute some post-source form (even if it includes source, like a gem or npm package)\n\nVersions are absolutely crucial. The fact that two projects both use Node or Python doesn't actually mean much in my experience. There may be wide divergence in their dependencies and therefore total cost of ownership. But maybe we can start small. For starters, cluster Python vs Node, etc. Then Python 2 vs Python 3. Then major versions of libraries on Python. Then minor versions. Then patch versions (because they're often abused).",

Assume projects distribute some post-source form (even if it includes source, like a gem or npm package)\n\nVersions are absolutely crucial. The fact that two projects both use Node or Python doesn't actually mean much in my experience. There may be wide divergence in their dependencies and therefore total cost of ownership. But maybe we can start small. For starters, cluster Python vs Node, etc. Then Python 2 vs Python 3. Then major versions of libraries on Python. Then minor versions. Then patch versions (because they're often abused)."

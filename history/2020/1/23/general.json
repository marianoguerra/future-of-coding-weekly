I see parallels here to other human psycho-technological constructs that haven't panned out well, like logical conlanguages and classical AI.\n\nIn the case of logical conlanguages, there's the social problem of people not agreeing on semantics and ontologies, and a tension between specific aesthetic notions of elegance and simplicity that the creators have, coming up against practical and realistic needs of a language speaker, and the psychology they already have. Seems like there may have been similar problems with the semantic web movement."

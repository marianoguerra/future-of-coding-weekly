And <@U8A5MS6R1> provides an important insight about the relationship between static and dynamic typing.\n\nMy Curv language is intended for live programming of graphical objects. It's intended for visual artists. But it is also its own extension language, so people with developer skills can use it to define new graphics primitives. To make Curv suitable for these two different audiences, I need a \"tiered\" structure. \"High Curv\" is a high level subset that contains everything you need for high level coding: procedural generation of graphical objects. \"Low Curv\" adds additional features that developers can use to define new library APIs with an easy to use interface and an efficient implementation. I want users to be able to develop libraries of new Curv graphics primitives and distribute them across the internet, without forking the project and hacking the C++ runtime. In particular, Low Curv supports GPU programming.\n\nHigh Curv is for end user programming. It needs to be easy to learn. From empirical studies I have read, the two big barriers to learning a programming language are learning the syntax, and learning the type system. High Curv supports live programming, which requires dynamic typing. And it has a very simple type system with a short learning curve. It is unacceptable in High Curv for a user to get a static type error that can only be fixed by adding type annotations. This also requires dynamic typing.\n\nLow Curv supports GPU programming: a Curv function can be compiled into a statically typed GPU kernel. To make this possible, there is a statically typed subset of Curv available within Low Curv.",

It's intended for visual artists. But it is also its own extension language, so people with developer skills can use it to define new graphics primitives. To make Curv suitable for these two different audiences, I need a \"tiered\" structure. \"High Curv\" is a high level subset that contains everything you need for high level coding: procedural generation of graphical objects. \"Low Curv\" adds additional features that developers can use to define new library APIs with an easy to use interface and an efficient implementation. I want users to be able to develop libraries of new Curv graphics primitives and distribute them across the internet, without forking the project and hacking the C++ runtime. In particular, Low Curv supports GPU programming.\n\nHigh Curv is for end user programming. It needs to be easy to learn. From empirical studies I have read, the two big barriers to learning a programming language are learning the syntax, and learning the type system. High Curv supports live programming, which requires dynamic typing. And it has a very simple type system with a short learning curve. It is unacceptable in High Curv for a user to get a static type error that can only be fixed by adding type annotations. This also requires dynamic typing.\n\nLow Curv supports GPU programming: a Curv function can be compiled into a statically typed GPU kernel. To make this possible, there is a statically typed subset of Curv available within Low Curv."

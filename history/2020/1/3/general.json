With that said, I don't think any of these environments provide special functionality for reloading a whole extension at once? Although that theoretically should be possible. Personally, I find dynamic load great for experimenting, but not as good for building things because it's too common to end up with something that works in your current application state, but that fails when run you restart your environment. I've found a better approach to be excellent state restoration and a really fast startup time, so you can close and re-load your environment and be right where you left off very quickly. (I'd be very interested in hearing if people have had different experiences with that though!)",

Although that theoretically should be possible. Personally, I find dynamic load great for experimenting, but not as good for building things because it's too common to end up with something that works in your current application state, but that fails when run you restart your environment. I've found a better approach to be excellent state restoration and a really fast startup time, so you can close and re-load your environment and be right where you left off very quickly. (I'd be very interested in hearing if people have had different experiences with that though!)"

        "text": "<@UEQ6M68H0> It sounds like you were thinking of something different from what those two engineers were likely talking about. They were probably talking about the CAN Bus systems in the car. CAN Bus is the protocol that computerized subsystems use to communicate, with each subsystem being a node on the bus. Each node is responsible for a particular _physically independent_ slice of functionality in the vehicle (eg: braking, climate, lights, transmission, steering, etc), and all nodes communicate via the universal CAN Bus protocol — that should smack of not only Unix and the internet, but also and especially of Erlang. In vehicles, similarly to Erlang, you want to be able to maximally continue operation in the event of catastrophic, and typically _physical,_ failure of any nodes or the network itself — things like cables being cut or a liquid being spilled on one of your chips or contacts corroding or electronics overheating or desoldering — because that might happen while you're speeding down the highway or driving up the side of a mountain. You want independent and redundant pieces that can, if needed and as much as possible, operate with a modicum of functionality in the absence of part or all of the network. Nodes or connections will fail, and graceless failure can be fatal.\n\nIf you have a \"host controller\" (that's the term from the automotive industry, IIRC) computer sitting at the center coordinating all your subsystem nodes — whether it's a single decision-maker or a quorum — then your whole system has a particularly large single point of failure. For instance, in the event of a failure that causes a network partition with the host controller on one side, the nodes on the other side are either useless or need to fall back to totally independent operation. With CAN Bus (like Erlang, like web services, etc), if you have a network partition, the components on each side can continue to communicate with the other components they can still see to do a better job of the things that they can individually and mutually do in the absence of the missing nodes.\n\nThe automotive industry (and other industries that use CAN Bus) have previously used other options, like wiring all nodes together point-to-point, or using a host controller, and to the best of my knowledge they settled on the CAN Bus approach specifically because it provided the greatest reliability during operation.",

And in my observation the smartest people tend to take a position of curiosity (and I think that's not an accident, since curiosity is how you become smart).\n\nWithout deep understanding of the problem, concluding that the experts are wrong and my intuition is right (to say nothing of telling them so) would probably be on the very bottom of the list of things to do— not the least because I've been on the other side, and I know how often non-experts have the right picture of my own field (and just how \"smart\" they look when they tell me I've got it all wrong "

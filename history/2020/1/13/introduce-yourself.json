Operon can fix this for JSON-data: I (or someone else) could e.g. build camel-operon -component, i.e. Operon could be used from Camel routes to transform data (jsonpath simply isn't enough, and other scripting languages are too verbose). However, the goal is to be able to use Operon as a standalone service for both integrations and data transformations, whenever possible. For this purpose a bunch of components has to builded, and for this task I will definitely need as much help as possible.",

This is Apple's decision, not mine. I am aware that there is some great software being developed for iOS. For example, there's a lot of great real-time music performance software for the iPad, and there's very little of that for Android. But for the FoC mobile software experience I described, based on Alan Kay's vision, the only hardware that supports it is Android devices and Windows tablets."

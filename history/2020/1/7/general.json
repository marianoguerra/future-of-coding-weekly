That cleared up the CPU to take care of other things, mostly shoving memory around to manage textures and create the raster image data for these from the UI framework. Apart from much slower chips, memory bandwidth was one of the biggest issues of the early iPhones. Core Animation worked around that very effectively.

If you ever used an early iPhone, you might remember the checkerboard pattern that showed up whenever you were scrolling into areas that hadn’t texture memory loaded yet — still it always felt responsive because you could see the inertia of the scrolling thanks to the checkerboard. That was a design decision realizing that it’s more important to have the animation be absolutely smooth than to see the actual content.\n\nIts greatest benefit is also its greatest weakness: once you commit an animation it just runs and you have little control over it. For animations that might be exactly what you want, but as Apple moved on to interruptible animation and gestures and now that chips are much more capable, Core Animation is likely on the way out to be replaced with something much more resembling FRP, although I wouldn’t count on Apple to deliver a pure functional approach. \n\nYou can get a glimpse of what it will look like with SwiftUI, which includes — apart from classic UI components still built on top the classic frameworks (but for how long?) — a simple graphics API for shapes and animations that is likely to eventually succeed Core Graphics (Quartz) and Core Animation and will be a more efficient implementation directly leveraging Metal.

                "text": "Crash-only software refers to computer programs that handle failures by simply restarting, without attempting any sophisticated recovery.  Correctly written components of crash-only software can microreboot to a known-good state without the help of a user.  Since failure-handling and normal startup use the same methods, this can increase the chance that bugs in failure-handling code will be noticed, except when there are leftover artifacts, such as data corruption from a severe failure, that don't occur during normal startup.\nCrash-only software also has benefits for end-users. All too often, applications do not save their data and settings while running, only at the end of their use. For example, word processors usually save settings when they are closed. A crash-only application is designed to save all changed user settings soon after they are changed, so that the persistent state matches that of the running machine. No matter how an application terminates (be it a clean close or the sudden failure of a laptop battery), the state will persist.",

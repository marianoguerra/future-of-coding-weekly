I suggested that having a pair of central computers that run all the systems would be safer than having 27 different computer systems in a car (Tesla has around that number of computer chips i understand). they were vehement, to the point of anger for suggesting that type of architecture. They insisted that having the braking system on its own machine was safer, because that way a failure in the combustion computer won't affect the braking. However, they were wrong, as the probability of failure increases as you add independent systems. If you have a 1 out of 1000 chance of a catastrophic failure in a single lightbulb, and you have 100 lightbulbs, the probability of a failure in at least 1 of them is almost 10%...so you are better off having only 3 computers, and running all the systems off of the vote of the majority. that is how they do it in spacecraft when they want things to work for 30 years without repair.  My guess is that they are worried about performance sagging at critical times with all these different processes. But still, the automotive business is cheap, and they typically have no redundancy on their critical sensors and systems. really not a great way to operate, and when the chips go out of production these cars will be unrepairable.

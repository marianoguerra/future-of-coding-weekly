Python became embedded into Linux a long time ago in multiple subsystems; various build systems like yum which is the essential tool used in Centos\/RedHat, and so on. In fact Centos 6.5 and earlier requires Python 2.6 else you can't run the OS, and for some reason if you install python 3 which has breaking changes to 2.6, Centos malfunctions. Most linux distributions are collections of hundreds of different utilities, and each of those has a dependency chain. The poor design of the Unix shared library (DLL's to those familiar with Windows) has been its achilles heel for a long time. This is why linux doesn't make much forward progress; most of the builds are just reshufflings of the existing tools rather than forward motion, held back by the inability to gracefully move forward. The whole Docker ecosystem can be considered to exist solely to fix the shared library conflict issue, by creating a custom environment for each program to exist in. A terrible band-aid over a festering sore IMHO.",

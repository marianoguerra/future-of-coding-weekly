A full system has many layers. If we are live editing the code at layer N, then the SUD and SIU can share layers 0..N-1, but we fork layers N and above. If we are live editing the GPU driver, we need 2 physical GPUs, one connected to the SUD and one connected to the SIU. We can crash the GPU connected to the driver we are live editing without losing our development environment. If we are live editing the window manager, we don't need two GPUs, the SUD and SIU can share the same GPU driver instance. If we are live editing a declarative description of a new window theme, then, as long as the window theme API is \"safe\", we don't need to fork the window system to apply the new theme."

I'm curious if anybody here would quibble with it.\n\n&gt; Mu's strategies borrow much from past work. For example, Forth systems emphasize parsimonious dependencies but give up on safety in the process. Smalltalk systems emphasize safety while exposing a large fraction of their internals. However, there usually remains a kernel that requires exiting Smalltalk to modify. Lisp Machines built up all the way from custom hardware while remaining safe. Lisp, Forth and Smalltalk all emphasize uniform notation, though they also have strong and divergent opinions on what that notation should be.

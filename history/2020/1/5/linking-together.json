        "text": "Just a random data point. I wrote some system that required users to open a Terminal\/command line and install node, npm my system and run it from the command line. It got chosen by a university to be part of a class mostly full of artist students using Unity for interactive art projects. I became very clear almost immediately that any interaction with the terminal\/command line was a nightmare for these students.\n\nSimple things like typos, understanding current directories, etc were all foreign concepts.\n\nI ended up re-writing my system as a unity plugin to remove any need to touch the command line.\n\nThat doesn't mean I think the command line is dead. Just passing on an anecdote. As a dev it might be normal but looking around at non devs I certainly don't see much command line use.\n\nAs a dev though I have a hard time seeing the command line disappearing. command lines are somewhat cross platform. non-commandlines are using app specific. command lines have history, scrollback, search, search through history, command completion, filename completion, ...\n\nMaybe there is some magic UI that could do all of that kind of stuff as proficiently as the command line but I'm not sure what it would be. Picking \"file open\" or \"execute file\" and selecting from some kind of list doesn't sound efficient to me. It certainly hasn't been in the past. Further, in dev I'm often automating things via scripts. Scripts are often just multiple command lines. That is what bash is really. It's a REPL for bash scripts. So, to me, it makes sense that I will need to automate various build steps, I'll do that with some scripting language, I don't see what not having a command line would help here except to make it harder to test small things that I build up my scripts with.\n\nI am bullish on VR or AR changing dev environments. Even if just lots of virtual monitors. But, assuming they figure out finger detection and more, UIs could change a lot. Working though touchpads, mice, and touchsceens is basically like 1.5 fingers in use. With full finger recongnition I can push, pull, twist, stretch, squash, and many other things for which there is no easy analog with current common input devices. Also a 3D workspace that VR\/AR opens gives a lot more room for innovation than our 2D monitors.",

I wrote some system that required users to open a Terminal\/command line and install node, npm my system and run it from the command line. It got chosen by a university to be part of a class mostly full of artist students using Unity for interactive art projects. I became very clear almost immediately that any interaction with the terminal\/command line was a nightmare for these students.\n\nSimple things like typos, understanding current directories, etc were all foreign concepts.\n\nI ended up re-writing my system as a unity plugin to remove any need to touch the command line.\n\nThat doesn't mean I think the command line is dead. Just passing on an anecdote. As a dev it might be normal but looking around at non devs I certainly don't see much command line use.\n\nAs a dev though I have a hard time seeing the command line disappearing. command lines are somewhat cross platform. non-commandlines are using app specific. command lines have history, scrollback, search, search through history, command completion, filename completion, ...\n\nMaybe there is some magic UI that could do all of that kind of stuff as proficiently as the command line but I'm not sure what it would be. Picking \"file open\" or \"execute file\" and selecting from some kind of list doesn't sound efficient to me. It certainly hasn't been in the past. Further, in dev I'm often automating things via scripts. Scripts are often just multiple command lines. That is what bash is really. It's a REPL for bash scripts. So, to me, it makes sense that I will need to automate various build steps, I'll do that with some scripting language, I don't see what not having a command line would help here except to make it harder to test small things that I build up my scripts with.\n\nI am bullish on VR or AR changing dev environments. Even if just lots of virtual monitors. But, assuming they figure out finger detection and more, UIs could change a lot. Working though touchpads, mice, and touchsceens is basically like 1.5 fingers in use. With full finger recongnition I can push, pull, twist, stretch, squash, and many other things for which there is no easy analog with current common input devices. Also a 3D workspace that VR\/AR opens gives a lot more room for innovation than our 2D monitors."

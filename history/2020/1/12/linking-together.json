        "text": "The iphone touch screen display didn't arise out of a vacuum. Here's Alan Kay talking about the DynaBook in 1972:\n&gt; Suppose the display panel covers the full extent of the notepad surface. Any keyboard arrangement one might wish can then be displayed anywhere on the surface. (Then he talks about how the touch screen tech works.)\nIf you look at the accompanying illustrations in <https:\/\/www.mprove.de\/visionreality\/media\/Kay72a.pdf>, it is clear he is describing an iPad. The Apple Macintosh was based on Kay's work, so everybody on the Mac team was familiar with this vision.\n\nIn 1985, after the 1984 Macintosh release, Bill Atkinson pitched an updated version of Alan Kay's Dynapad to Apple: \"a flat-pad communicating computer called Magic Slate\". (ref: <https:\/\/www.wired.com\/1994\/04\/general-magic\/>)\n\nIn 1988, Marc Porat joined Apple, then started an official project called \"Pocket Crystal\". The concept drawings looked like an iPhone: a pocket size phone+computer, with a display covering the entire front surface. This project was spun off as General Magic in 1990. Bill Atkinson joined the team.\n\nMulti-touch displays, and the accompanying gestural language (such as pinch to zoom) had a multi-decade history in research labs before it was adopted by Apple. The technology went viral when Jeff Han presented a modern multi-touch interface in a 2006 TED talk, and the talk was published on YouTube. The iPhone was released a year later. <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5JcSu7h-I40>",

        "text": "the face system is tuned solely for a short distance, and has a very narrow design; to do AR you will need a much higher resolution, wider angle device that can measure the room you are in, it will require an entirely separate, and much more powerful chip, and the thing about face unlock is you aren't running any other processes yet because you haven't unlocked the phone, so it is a sleep mode. However when the AR is running, you will be in an app which is already consuming CPU and GPU cycles, so you are now in the full operating mode. I wouldn't be surprised if they added some pre-processing chip just to help the AR computations. And since you want to launch with software that shows off the feature, i would expect it will take apple years to bolt this onto the phone. But it is coming because they are going to need some sizzle now that Honor and Xiaomi are nipping at Apple's heels with their products. The samsung galaxy 20 just leaked today, with a rumored 4 cameras. At four cameras i think you max out on that aspect, and in a couple of years they will be hungry for some exclusive amazing new feature. In just a few years the cellphone will replace desktops, and you will just dock the phone to a large monitor, and that will be your computer. The latest phones are already 6GB RAM; that is more than probably the majority of laptops out there.  I will never give up my giant monitor, but i could easily live with a tiny computer; i just switched from Mac Pro to Mac Mini, a very slight speed improvement, but 20 times weight reduction. We saw it with mainframes, minicomputers, workstations, personal computers, cellphones are the next evolution of the computer.",

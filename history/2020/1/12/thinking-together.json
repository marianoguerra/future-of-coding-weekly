        "text": "My main goals for Curv are:\n• Artistic expressiveness. You can make any kind of 2D or 3D art, using a wide variety of techniques.\n• Ease of use. This covers a lot of ground, including the IDE and the language itself.\nMathematical purity is not a goal, but there are lots of areas in the design where mathematical purity makes important contributions to artistic expressiveness, ease of use, and ease of engineering. So I use mathematical purity as a tool, not as an end in itself:\n• Pure functional programming. This contributes greatly to ease of use, and simplifies the engineering (generating data-parallel rendering code). The semantics of the language are much simpler. A pure functional API for constructing shapes by composing functions is *so much nicer* than a 1990's style API where graphical primitives paint directly onto a canvas and you have to manage a set of global variables containing the current colour, the current line width, the current transformation matrix, etc.\n• Abstract algebra, what Haskell calls \"equational reasoning\". Unlike most programming languages, the equality operator `a==b` is an equivalence relation: `a==a`; `a==b` implies `b==a`; `a==b` and `b==c` implies `a==c`. Unlike most dynamic languages, the boolean operations obey all the axioms of a boolean algebra. For example, unlike in Python Javascript Lisp, the boolean and operator is commutative. This all falls under ease of use: simple language semantics, no surprises.\nHowever, there are some kinds of mathematical purity in Haskell culture that are detrimental to my goals.\n• Lazy function calls are a net loss; Curv uses strict argument evaluation in function calls.\n• Static typing is a big barrier to learning a language, and is incompatible with live programming, so Curv is dynamically typed.\n• I haven't built a Turing complete reactive API yet, but DCTP looks really hard to understand. The Elm language transitioned from \"mathematically pure\" FRP to \"the Elm architecture\", which is much easier to understand, and it is still \"pure functional\" and \"reactive\". So I'll probably take my lead from Elm, begin with the Elm architecture, and iterate from there.",

        "text": "<@UCGAK10LS> Seems like we're thinking about similar things — would love to hear\/read more about your project.\n\nI went down the linguistics route (I'm two years in now), and as much as I'm happy to find people interested in it, from the previous discussion I can only sense that it would be more of a distraction for you than it would actually help. What you seem to be looking for is what linguists and cognitive scientists call \"categorization\". When I found out about it, I was shocked how much linguists ask the same questions we ask when we try to design a good data model.\n\nIf you stay on the \"classic\" generative linguistics path (Chomsky et al.), you'd better get extremely comfortable around hierarchies and taxonomies. It seems most of the work here in the last few decades is basically trying to fit into the classic models what we learn about how the brain works, which more and more diverts from what can be meaningfully expressed with those models that are primarily based on set theory, perhaps with some fuzzy logic applied to it. It looks a lot like the frustration you voiced earlier — we can make it work by stretching the current models and making them much more complex, but it's everything but satisfying.\n\nThere are linguists who realized that and who went looking for new approaches. I've been looking deeply into cognitive linguistics and think that's a great field to look at for inspiration. There's Rosch's prototype theory, which is still pretty close to classic categorization with a little bit of fuzzy logic sprinkled in, but that's just the gateway drug into metaphorical structuring and image schemas, and then all your set-theory based logic goes out the window, and you're left with embodied cognition and stuff that is way too ambiguous for what we'd like for static modeling. It seems you have extremely specific use cases in mind, and so I don't feel good about recommending you look into this.\n\nWhen you say you're looking for more powerful models, _\"something more powerful than graphs\"_, I wonder what that means to you?\n\nIf you want more flexibility in modeling, you need to take into account that this always comes in the form of trade-offs. Mathematics has this pretty much figured out though. If you look at algebraic structures you can pick one with few rules, which gives you a lot of flexibility of what you can model with them, but then you can't do much with these models — if you can't make any assumptions about structure, you can't run algorithms against it.

What you seem to be looking for is what linguists and cognitive scientists call \"categorization\". When I found out about it, I was shocked how much linguists ask the same questions we ask when we try to design a good data model.\n\nIf you stay on the \"classic\" generative linguistics path (Chomsky et al.), you'd better get extremely comfortable around hierarchies and taxonomies. It seems most of the work here in the last few decades is basically trying to fit into the classic models what we learn about how the brain works, which more and more diverts from what can be meaningfully expressed with those models that are primarily based on set theory, perhaps with some fuzzy logic applied to it. It looks a lot like the frustration you voiced earlier — we can make it work by stretching the current models and making them much more complex, but it's everything but satisfying.\n\nThere are linguists who realized that and who went looking for new approaches. I've been looking deeply into cognitive linguistics and think that's a great field to look at for inspiration. There's Rosch's prototype theory, which is still pretty close to classic categorization with a little bit of fuzzy logic sprinkled in, but that's just the gateway drug into metaphorical structuring and image schemas, and then all your set-theory based logic goes out the window, and you're left with embodied cognition and stuff that is way too ambiguous for what we'd like for static modeling. It seems you have extremely specific use cases in mind, and so I don't feel good about recommending you look into this.\n\nWhen you say you're looking for more powerful models, "

Mathematics has this pretty much figured out though. If you look at algebraic structures you can pick one with few rules, which gives you a lot of flexibility of what you can model with them, but then you can't do much with these models — if you can't make any assumptions about structure, you can't run algorithms against it.

I mean a model that makes it *easy* to express the things that a programmer might want to express, i.e. being _possible_ is not enough. It's _possible_ to model anything with a (souped-up) graph, I'm sure, but that doesn't help much.\n\nI definitely think a better model exists. As I said before, the models we know about today were just *invented* by some creative people a few decades or centuries ago, usually as a tool to explore a particular domain. Nobody _discovered_ graph theory in the Amazon rainforest or on the surface of Venus. There _are_ some fundamental patterns that result from the physical laws of our universe (e.g. as reified in geometry), but the models we build around these patterns are typically layered with additional constraints. We have a new domain now: programming, and I think it's very possible to invent new models which are appropriate for the domain.",

                "text": "When specifying, designing and implementing technology for work, it is very important to consider the whole of the potential user group, and not to forget that this might include people with disabilities. Obvious reasons for this are demography, disabled people forming a significant and growing proportion of the workforce, and legal obligations caused by equal opportunities legislation. There are more subtle reasons, however, which link so-called ‘disabled people’ with the rest of the population. The paper notes that most people have some disabilities, sometimes temporarily due to accident, or permanently due to ageing and other processes. In addition it notes that even otherwise fully functioning people can be seriously handicapped by hostile environments, and a parallel is drawn between the human interface needs of disabled people operating in ordinary situations and able-bodied people operating in high workload and stress situations. The paper concludes by suggesting a research agenda for the field on the basis of these considerations.",

        "text": "<@UCGAK10LS> Your thoughts triggered a line of thinking for me. What makes a groundbreaking thing groundbreaking? I think that discovering groundbreaking new technologies is more a function of connecting a set of normally unrelated ideas together. Most breakthroughs and new technologies have been a slow iteration of new ideas based on old ones, experimentation and connecting unrelated ones. Take flying, for example. Powered flight actually arose nearly simultaneously in several places because the necessary supporting ideas were available, we just had to put them together. This is true of almost everything. I'm not sure if I agree with this, but maybe you could argue that we don't have groundbreaking technologies anymore because *everything* is groundbreaking. In the age of the internet, we iterate so fast and can so easily connect so many different ideas together that it has become utterly common place.\n\nTruly groundbreaking technologies need to seem to come from nowhere. That is, there needs to be something mysterious in the source of it and it needs to fundamentally change the course of history. By the second measure, the internet, the iPhone, reusable space program, electric vehicles, batteries, cloud computing and so much more are in a very real sense changing nearly everything, except it's all mixed up and happening so fast that nothing looks groundbreaking anymore. Further, the mystery is gone in some sense. We have a really high quality record of where the innovations are coming from, what ideas are being combined and how. The internet is insane.\n\nTake Newton for example. Newton did a lot of utterly absurdly groundbreaking work. But in large part, that is because 1) we have limited records of the thought processes and ideas that were connected to get there and 2) he had access to much of the knowledge of his time and 3) it stood out from it's contemporary work. I also think there is a component of groundbreaking work coming from a single mind where it has to be conceivable in a single mind and not a lot of minds were doing the conceiving. That is, Newton lived in an age where a single human mind could \"discover gravity\" as it were. I would argue that we have minds today that are able to conceive of, understand and \"break ground\" on vastly more complex and strange things than Newton ever did. What has changed is the environment, frequency and number of minds conceiving.\n\nI highly recommend \"How to Fly a Horse\" by Kevin Ashton: <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/How_to_Fly_a_Horse#:~:text=0385538596-,How%20to%20Fly%20a%20Horse%3A%20The%20Secret%20History%20of%20Creation,the%20true%20source%20of%20innovation>.",

(Warning: a very personal perspective follows)\n\nPerhaps the word \"groundbreaking\" was too strong — it has too many connotations. My point is that I refuse to dismiss the possibility that I can invent something wholly new. I get the vibe from people sometimes that they believe they can invent new *products* but not new *models*. At best, they take some model that already exists and tweak it, and I'm given advice to do the same. There's a big difference between products and models, and Silicon Valley only knows how to make software _products_ (and _occasionally_ hardware products), and even then... most software products have poor utility and\/or ergonomics. Silicon Valley isn't pumping out much new computer science (relative to their size), except in very specific niches like machine learning. And don't get me started on academia: they stick to very specific niches that are \"accepted\" within their circles — it's a game of conformity, or \"micro-innovation\".\n\nNew products are great, but there's a limit of how much we can achieve by building incrementally upon the ideas and the models that are already known to \"work\". You cited stuff like the iPhone and Elon's stuff: those are the exceptions, not the norm. Those were\/are situations where people asked \"what if we try designing from scratch?\". The existing notions of what a \"phone\" or a \"car\" entailed were thrown away, even the core fundamentals like having buttons or (soon) having a driver. You can treat math the same way: there's nothing sacred about existing mathematical models. You can use them as inspiration whilst being fully prepared to move beyond what exists.",

Silicon Valley isn't pumping out much new computer science (relative to their size), except in very specific niches like machine learning. And don't get me started on academia: they stick to very specific niches that are \"accepted\" within their circles — it's a game of conformity, or \"micro-innovation\".\n\nNew products are great, but there's a limit of how much we can achieve by building incrementally upon the ideas and the models that are already known to \"work\". You cited stuff like the iPhone and Elon's stuff: those are the exceptions, not the norm. Those were\/are situations where people asked \"what if we try designing from scratch?\". The existing notions of what a \"phone\" or a \"car\" entailed were thrown away, even the core fundamentals like having buttons or (soon) having a driver. You can treat math the same way: there's nothing sacred about existing mathematical models. You can use them as inspiration whilst being fully prepared to move beyond what exists."

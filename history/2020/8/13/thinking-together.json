I'm thinking about improving CLIs while keeping what I like about them. One thing I'd like to improve is interactivity in the output. Different use cases require different levels of detail and currently, there's no way to change the level of detail once the result of a command is printed. For example, a lot of commands include `--verbose` options that perform the same action, but print additional output. So what if you could interactively decide what information to show in the output? This would allow more flexible / readable output and wouldn't require re-running commands to get additional information. In the tweet below, I mocked a simple example where a stack trace is hidden by default, but can be shown when needed. What do you think of this small idea?\n<https://twitter.com/FKohlgrueber/status/1293865745420615680>",

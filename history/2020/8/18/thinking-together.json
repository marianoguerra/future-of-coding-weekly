Here’s the obligatory “incrementer button”\n```an incrementer is a button with a count of 0\n    the text is bound to its count\n\nwhen an incrementer is clicked\n    increment the count```\nNone of that is builtin, e.g. here’s how increment is defined:\n```to increment a number\n    set the number to the number + 1```\nAnd here’s a button:\n```a button is an element that has a text string\n    its tag is \"button\"\n    always set \"textContent\" of the button to its text```",

I want readers to be able to verbalize an entire system, as if they were hearing a (detailed, accurate) description from a friend.\n\nRegarding \"following the lead of mathematics\", my language is going to be extraordinarily light on *functions* (if I can get away with it), and thus on mathematical notation. Code re-use occurs through via interrelated rules that observe and produce abstracted data through pattern-matching. These act like polymorphic functions, so for most computations there is nothing to \"call\" and no need for mathematical primitives, no \"f(x)\". We can still retain that classical syntax for mathematical (numeric) expressions, though.\n\nRegarding \"multiple words that parse like a token\", that shouldn't be a problem, because programs will be built through structured editing (AST etc) with appropriate autocomplete and syntax highlighting.\n\nI'll see if I can come up with a napkin example that I can actually defend! I'm still working on the semantics of my system, and I'm worried that an example wouldn't make sense to anyone else yet.",

These act like polymorphic functions, so for most computations there is nothing to \"call\" and no need for mathematical primitives, no \"f(x)\". We can still retain that classical syntax for mathematical (numeric) expressions, though.\n\nRegarding \"multiple words that parse like a token\", that shouldn't be a problem, because programs will be built through structured editing (AST etc) with appropriate autocomplete and syntax highlighting.\n\nI'll see if I can come up with a napkin example that I can actually defend! I'm still working on the semantics of my system, and I'm worried that an example wouldn't make sense to anyone else yet."

More generally, human language is lousy for describing anything that is abstract. Concrete examples are needed if only just to indicate what is being talked about. Motivating examples add a further emotional appeal, a reason why the topic is important. For example, if I propose the Patriot Act, there will be little interest until a motivating example like 9\/11 comes along. The presentation must make the audience *want it*.",

I think we are too quick to compare products without taking a couple minutes to think more deeply. I’ve shared this product to other communities and people who 1:1 and get tremendous feedback beyond “well this looks like Zapier” when it’s nothing like it. What’s frustrating is the shallow feedback, sorry to be blunt. At Amazon, people present one page (no demo) ideas that get scrutinized deeply. I understand FoC is not Amazon…. at times I wish it behaved more like it however. Where even the smallest ideas got more attention than _blink_ feedback that aims to compare more than ask questions.",

After putting many sleepless nights of work and thought into Eve, we had conversations in the Eve community that went in entirely unexpected directions too. That said, communities like FoC and Eve are folks who banded together _because_ of a shared belief in something better. They've got every incentive to help each other, and if they're failing to do so, that likely means there's a serious issue preventing them from understanding how. It's particularly dangerous to assume the problem is that they don't care enough or aren't putting the time in -- these folks are dedicating their free time to try to help because they _do_ want Storyscript to succeed. Suggesting otherwise is a very quick way to lose friends and advocates.\n\nIt might be a good idea to try and revisit some of the feedback and see if you can find a way to tailor the message to help us engage with the idea more like you intended. As is, it seems pretty clear that there is a market segment full of the best evangelizers money _can't_ buy who aren't connecting with it yet.",

Does the tradeoff make sense? Flexibility for power. (Just checked Wikipedia, yeah ASIC or FPGA that is just for python for example). Wonder if anyone has tried it and if it would be more widespread in future. ",

One of the more recent ones was by my research group in grad school 10 or so years ago: <https:\/\/www.cs.utexas.edu\/~trips>. But see also Dataflow architectures (<https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dataflow_architecture>), and MIT's Raw processor (<http:\/\/groups.csail.mit.edu\/cag\/raw>). While it's possible we're just one breakthrough away from making it work, it is an Open Research Problem.\n* Hardware people know what they're doing, far more than us software people. Whether that's because they're Superior Human Beings, or because their domain is easier, you seek to make hardware more like software at your peril. Imagine having to fix a security vulnerability in a chip instead of a compiler.\n* Hardware has less open source, and you seek to implement layers of software in hardware at your peril. Imagine having to convince your processor supplier of the value of open source. Imagine having to create a new programming language in nights and weekends _in hardware_. Now ask yourself why you would want to ask others to do something that hobbyists wouldn't do, to put up with a less malleable medium. The best ideas in computing have come from hobbyists. I want a more inclusive future, not less.\n* Python is Python only because all the hard stuff has native libraries that work with existing processors. If you plan to migrate those to pure Python, that gives up much of the benefit of using an existing language with a large install base. Might as well use a better language.\n* The term \"von neumann bottleneck\" is fundamentally about improving performance. Improving performance isn't in my top 10 major problems facing the future of software.",

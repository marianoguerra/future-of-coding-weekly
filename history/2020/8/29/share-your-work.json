When you define your `ui-root` you give it a `lookup` function and `content-keys` . from there it works like reduce: you pass it a `root-id` that it passes to `lookup`. lookup returns data that root wraps in your defined UI components or the default component. It also looks for `content-keys` on `lookup`s return value, passes those to `lookup` and recurses down all the paths. Upfront root is not aware of the structure of the data. Given the id, `lookup` can run arbitrary computation. It can for example issue an http request or read from indexedDB. It can return data or a promise that root will resolve and eventually render. It’s dumb by design and that gives it lots of flexibility.",

Emphasize synchronization over imperative API calls. _Imperative APIs encourage data silos._ They are the underlying technical part of the problem that Zapier and ITTT try to solve. See [0] and [1] for some ideas.\n2. Allow users to submit \"agents\" rather than \"requests.\" An agent is a small program given extremely limited resources (limited process\/memory\/runtime budget) that you can safely run on your server. It is a possible answer to many of the standards\/protocols that wouldn't exist if frontends were running on the same machines as backends. [2]\n3. Emphasize composition over integration. Functions compose (nest, recurse). Event emitters don't. As long as APIs are built to be integrated rather than composed, making them work together is a full-time or full-company job (eg. Zapier).\n4. Make things immutable. Immutability allows APIs to \"play\" with one another without fear of setting off the nukes (ie. side effects). It's possible that this approach would make it so that integrating two APIs becomes a job for ML\/AI rather than humans.\nThis is from my limited understanding of some of the ideas in FOC.

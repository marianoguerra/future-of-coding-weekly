        "text": "I was rewatching Are We There Yet the other day (<https:\/\/www.infoq.com\/presentations\/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey\/>) which is Rich Hickey (mr Clojure himself)'s treatise on how he sees the world, how objects are lies, and how modelling whole applications as streams of new states produced by pure functions with structural sharing to keep performance good. super interesting to see him talking about this in the Java community in 2009 and see it percolate through to the JS community with immer and redux and whatnot, but i was struck by a certain feeling that i'd love to know if y'all share.\n\nThe whole OOP\/functional debate, this talk, and frankly a lot of my thinking seem to principally be about modelling logic, and striving to get to some place where state is abstracted away. I\/we seem to want to get to a world where I\/we think mostly about computation and not about state change over time. I had a very strange experience switching from working on a backend team where state is the devil and ruins performance of everything (it'd be so fast if it didn't store anything!) to working in analytics where data is everything and where the code is a tiny little ever-changing bit of glue that manipulates this massive, permanent, far more important artifact. I found it nasty. It's nasty because the data captures every mistake ever made, which pile up and force every user to care about until fixed. It's nasty because it's big and hard to make development responsive. It's nasty because it feels wrong to write \"poor\" code you run once to fix something then delete, and it is really hard to get a handle on the shape, or quality, or meaning of real big datasets.\n\nI think I had (have) data-phobia, and it took getting immersed in a data-heavy product to realize that I think I\/we have it backwards, and that the data is more important than the instructions for manipulating it, and deserves to be the focus, not the nagging feeling at the back of your head. What I was struck with in Rich's talk is that the epochal time model and FP writ large seem like they are born of the same phobia, trying to escape the shackles of state management in order to get back to some pure world of computation that doesn't actually exist. A bunch of Bret Victor's work circles around this too, where the instructions to run the code are way less emphasized than the (often visual) data created by what the instructions are actually doing. All the hover-to-see-the-value or watch-this-expression debugging tools are us being forced to go back from pure computation to look at the actual data flowing through once more. Airtable\/spreadsheets are counter examples of non-data-phobic tools that seem to be easier to use, maybe because they put the data first.\n\nSo ... am I off my rocker? Is data-phobia a real thing, a force that has shaped our tools to demote a super important piece of our lives? Is there an antidote?",

I\/we seem to want to get to a world where I\/we think mostly about computation and not about state change over time. I had a very strange experience switching from working on a backend team where state is the devil and ruins performance of everything (it'd be so fast if it didn't store anything!) to working in analytics where data is everything and where the code is a tiny little ever-changing bit of glue that manipulates this massive, permanent, far more important artifact. I found it nasty. It's nasty because the data captures every mistake ever made, which pile up and force every user to care about until fixed. It's nasty because it's big and hard to make development responsive. It's nasty because it feels wrong to write \"poor\" code you run once to fix something then delete, and it is really hard to get a handle on the shape, or quality, or meaning of real big datasets.\n\nI think I had (have) data-phobia, and it took getting immersed in a data-heavy product to realize that I think I\/we have it backwards, and that the data is more important than the instructions for manipulating it, and deserves to be the focus, not the nagging feeling at the back of your head. What I was struck with in Rich's talk is that the epochal time model and FP writ large seem like they are born of the same phobia, trying to escape the shackles of state management in order to get back to some pure world of computation that doesn't actually exist. A bunch of Bret Victor's work circles around this too, where the instructions to run the code are way less emphasized than the (often visual) data created by what the instructions are actually doing. All the hover-to-see-the-value or watch-this-expression debugging tools are us being forced to go back from pure computation to look at the actual data flowing through once more. Airtable\/spreadsheets are counter examples of non-data-phobic tools that seem to be easier to use, maybe because they put the data first.\n\nSo ... am I off my rocker? Is data-phobia a real thing, a force that has shaped our tools to demote a super important piece of our lives? Is there an antidote?"

This definition has more specific context associated with it. In this sense, \"reproducibility\" is the ability to make a copy or simulacrum that exhibits the same behavior or results of *a research paper* specifically for the purpose of peer review and validation.\n\nThis definition often implies that the reproduction should be created *completely independently from original result* using only the information found in the paper (and associated references and domain knowledge), but no contact with the original authors.\n\nThis second definition is what I believe <@UN9SCH5RD> was referring to, based on the context of his post and associated links. My response to that post was an attempt to separate the two concepts. I think I did a bad job initially, and hopefully this is more clear.",

It just needs to justify itself against the cognitive overhead it causes."

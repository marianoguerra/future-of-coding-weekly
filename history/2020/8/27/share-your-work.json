I'll throw it on a new layer, so I can catch it when I come back for rewrites.\n• I hate this sentence. I don't think it needs to be here. Let me hide it and live with that for a while.\n• I think I might be using too many adverbs. Let me make an adverbs layer, and I'll pull things onto that as I re-read, and then see how bad it actually is.\n• And.. new layer for \"tweetables\", and a separate one for \"pull quotes\"...",

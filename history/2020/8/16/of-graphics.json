Dali is a generalized 2D\/3D graphics API that supports signed distance field operations, which gives it enormous flexibility and expressiveness. In the same way that 2D vector graphics supports curved shapes that are scalable and resolution independent, Dali also supports 3D shapes that are curved, scalable and resolution independent. Dali also supports a full range of SDF operations that can be applied to any 2D or 3D shape, including many that are not supported by traditional graphics systems based on boundary representation. I already implemented this once already in my Curv project, but there's no text support, and there are performance limitations, so Dali will use a new high performance architecture. I am looking at Pathfinder and Piet to see how much I can reuse.\n\nAs part of Dali, I need a text renderer that supports signed distance queries on font data, because that allows the full range of SDF operations to be applied to text. So you can apply non-affine transformations, morph, extrude text into 3D, engrave text into the surface of a 3D object, etc. I am investigating the idea that a single SDF based text renderer can be used to render text in both the 2D and 3D cases. There was already a project that worked this way: \"<http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/summary?doi=10.1.1.154.9948|Real Time Texture-Mapped Vector Glyphs>\". The paper was published in 2006, before compute shaders, before Vulkan, before Piet and Pathfinder. The GPU tech landscape has changed a lot, so I'd like to see if this architecture can be resurrected and made more efficient using current technology and ideas.

You build a \"graphics tree\", where the nodes are graphics primitives and operators, then you load this tree into the GPU, which interprets and renders it.

These tree modifications are synchronized with the GPU's copy of the tree."

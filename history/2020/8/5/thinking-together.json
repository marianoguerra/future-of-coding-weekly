Also, empty strings are bad. Yes. Think about this: we've had the concept of 'zero' for 1000s of years but only very recently added the concept of 'empty string' - why? Could it be mainly for modeling in computers? There is no zero-like symbol you can write in a paper form where text is expected. Yes you could write `N\/A` but that conflates null and \"\". Sometimes you might be asked to write _why_ it is `N\/A`.\n\nConsider that there are valid questions for which the _meaningful_ _answer_ is zero: \"How many toilet paper rolls are there in the store?\", \"What is the temperature of the snow?\" etc. There are no questions where the 'empty string' answer has a clear-cut meaning: \"What is your spouse's name?\", \"What city do you live in?\" etc. What does an answer of `\"\"` mean? It could mean _\"I don't know\"_ or _\"I dont want to tell you\"_ or _\"There isn't one\"_. Can these always be mapped to null or \"\"? I don't think so.\n\nIn type systems that have both, the empty string and null, you end up with the question of 'what does null mean' vs 'what does empty string mean'. Sometimes when you have two missing values in the world that you want to model - you end up mapping these to '' and null. But really this has nothing to do with a generic solution - it's often just a reality twisted to fit the types. If you want to model _three_ missing values e.g. 'unknown', 'non-existent', 'secret\/intentionally-blank' - how do you map these to \"\" and null? Maybe the best solution here is to model the value as an enum? `unknown, non_existent, intentionally_blank, value(real_string_here)` . AFAIK no systems, languages have a great solution. However I feel better solutions lie in exploring the 'information modeling' space - RDF etc (perhaps with some kind of versioned schemas to describe what is possible and necessary.) Basically we don't want multiple data representations to correspond to a single reality (which is what happens in null vs \"\", or sometimes with nested `option&lt;option&lt;option&lt;t&gt;&gt;&gt;`).",

I'm not sure \"modal\" dialogs count, since it's pretty hard to be confused about whether your actions will be interpreted by the dialog or not (which is not to say I fully endorse their use; IMO they tend to be clumsy).",

I'm not sure \"modal\" dialogs count, since it's pretty hard to be confused about whether your actions will be interpreted by the dialog or not (which is not to say I fully endorse their use; IMO they tend to be clumsy)."

No one can edit an object apart from you unless you permit it. That's the plan. Not written that bit yet in the current (C) implementation!",

Bear in mind the general public don't give a shit about privacy :joy: .\n&gt; .\nOK, not sure about \"kook vibes\", but I get that some folks won't be motivated by the P2P-ness and freedom aspects. Many do though, especially recently.\n\n&gt; Then she read the bit about \"no apps\" etc. She just found this confusing. I don't think she can really conceptualise what this means. To her it just sounded like \"you can't use Instagram or WhatsApp on this\".\n&gt; .\nNope, no apps. That's the point. Give up apps, give up their prison and their control and surveillance. Get freedom. I guess that either is or isn't a motivation for a given person!\n\n&gt; I think maybe you need to come at it from the direction of what problems you are promising to solve. Rather than bashing on Instagram, say how you will make it better, stuff like that\n&gt; .\nThe problem is that we have given up control. The Object Network solves that problem. So bashing on Insta is part of the story!\n\nThanks again for the experiment, it's useful from a \"framing the audience\" point of view to know that there are people out there who are happy with how things are.

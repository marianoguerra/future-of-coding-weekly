        "text": "*Conditionals and multi-line functions*\n\nI've been noodling on how to do conditionals in my postfix shell. Some ideas for keywords\/functions:\n\n* `return` seems quite essential. Stops executing the current function and returns top of stack.\n* `if{` and `}` and `}else{`. Here's how factorial would look with them:\n```n fact\n  = n 1 &lt;= if{ 0 return } n 1- fact n *```\n* `-&gt;` executes rest of line only if top of stack is true. Factorial again, this time in two lines:\n```n fact\n  = n 1 &lt;= -&gt; 0 return\n    n 1- fact n *```\n* `-&lt;` executes one of the next two words depending on whether top of stack is true or false.\n* `-&gt;` and `-&lt;` may also work well with `{` and `}` which group words together:\n```n fact\n  = n 1 &lt;= -&gt; {0 return} n 1- fact n *```\nA more challenging example is binary search. The gold standard here is Bret Victor's demo in _\"Inventing on Principle\"_ (linked above; screenshot below). Some attempts in postfix:\n```array key bsearch\n  = array key 0 array len bsearch-range          # delegate to helper with explicit low and high\n\n# option A\narray key low high bsearch-range\n  = low high &gt;= if{ null return }                # not found\n    low high + 2 div =mid                        # mid = (low+high)\/2\n    array mid [] key = if{ mid return }          # if array[mid] == key, return mid\n    array mid [] key &lt; if{ array key mid high bsearch-range return }  # if array[mid] &lt; key, recurse over [mid, high)\n    array key low mid bsearch-range              # otherwise recurse over [low, mid)\n\n# option B\narray key low high bsearch-range\n  = low high &gt;= -&gt; null return                   # not found\n    low high + 2 div =mid                        # mid = (low+high)\/2\n    array mid [] key = -&gt; mid return             # if array[mid] == key, return mid\n    array mid [] key &lt; -&gt; array key mid high bsearch-range return   # if array[mid] &lt; key, recurse over [mid, high)\n    array key low mid bsearch-range              # otherwise recurse over [low, mid)\n\n# option C\narray key low high bsearch-range\n  = low high &gt;= -&gt; null return                   # not found\n    low high + 2 div =mid                        # mid = (low+high)\/2\n    array mid [] =midval                         # midval = array[mid]\n    midval key = -&gt; mid return                   # if midval == key, return mid\n    midval key &lt; =upper?                         # upper? = (midval &lt; key)\n    # return bsearch-range(array, key, upper ? mid : low, upper ? high : mid)\n    array key upper? -&lt; mid low upper? -&lt; high mid bsearch-range```\nBut how to visualize a function spanning multiple lines that operates on an array?

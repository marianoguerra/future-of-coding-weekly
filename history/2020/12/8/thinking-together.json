Binding async state to UI is a open challenge still being addressed by UI framework like React. While render-as-you-fetch (<https:\/\/reactjs.org\/docs\/concurrent-mode-suspense.html>) looks promising, but React did not ship with concurrent mode yet for many good reasons. Another challenge is efficient data caching &amp; batching. With manual I\/O, developer is manually tweaking the I\/O operations. Binding async expression to UI, force the developer to rely on the framework to do the right thing. It is possible to auto-optimize in many cases, but it will require the developers to \"let go\" some control. It requires significant trust between you and the developers using your stuff to write software.",

It provides the \"column view\" of exploring a code\/system down a specific path.\n\n<@U019PRL1BNU> some more feedback: I'm not sure drawing to code line is ideal. Just scrolling will cause the line to move and most lines will still be pinned to the top or bottom (out of view). However snapping the connection to the 'scroll bar location' which is more stable and visually provides the location of the sub-window in the parent window.\n\nOne issue I had browsing around was scrolling in the canvas vs scrolling within a window. Since it's the same shortcut, often I scroll in the window when I want to pan the canvas. Would be nice if I had to click to make it active first.",

Just scrolling will cause the line to move and most lines will still be pinned to the top or bottom (out of view). However snapping the connection to the 'scroll bar location' which is more stable and visually provides the location of the sub-window in the parent window.\n\nOne issue I had browsing around was scrolling in the canvas vs scrolling within a window. Since it's the same shortcut, often I scroll in the window when I want to pan the canvas. Would be nice if I had to click to make it active first."

The goal: for a given framework (SQL, Datalog, vanilla Python, Python with Pandas, etc), what tasks are possible to express, and how hard is each task? Thinking about this as both a learning resource (quickly see lots of examples for a task or language) and an actual benchmark (eg compare lines of code or other metrics). Curious if anyone knows of a resource like this (eg Rosetta Code, TodoMVC)."

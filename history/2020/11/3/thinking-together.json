There is a place to release your work, repeatedly face rejection and criticism, and occasionally win. The key seems to be a communal value system. People strive to produce valued work, but often with an edge that tries to nudge the values in some direction. People care enough about the values that they invest in evaluating and criticizing other people’s work.\n\nIf you want to fund the future of computing I suggest funding a competition with a prize."

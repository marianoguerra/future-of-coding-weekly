Few thoughts from somebody who is relatively new to this community and is more on the practical side (working on my project):\n- I love seeing some of the abstract conversations, they can be inspiring and thought provoking. They take me out of the specific problem I am working and give some new insights.\n- I don't think abstract conversations and practice exclude each other, they actually go well very together. Practice is boring without some dreaming, and dreaming starts to get disappointing when there are no results (practice).\n- from what I see, this community and Handmade don't share the mission. They are about rethinking solutions that are using a lot of layers and are inefficient, and making them from scratch to be more efficient and possibly elegant. This community on other hand is trying to make programming more accessible. In my view, that very often means opposite of Handmade - we don't care about performance, but about usability, and that often means putting one more layer at the top.\n- It seems to me there are quite a few projects on here that are being actively worked on, so I don't feel like it is all talk and no work!",

Few thoughts from somebody who is relatively new to this community and is more on the practical side (working on my project):\n- I love seeing some of the abstract conversations, they can be inspiring and thought provoking. They take me out of the specific problem I am working and give some new insights.\n- I don't think abstract conversations and practice exclude each other, they actually go well very together. Practice is boring without some dreaming, and dreaming starts to get disappointing when there are no results (practice).\n- from what I see, this community and Handmade don't share the mission. They are about rethinking solutions that are using a lot of layers and are inefficient, and making them from scratch to be more efficient and possibly elegant. This community on other hand is trying to make programming more accessible. In my view, that very often means opposite of Handmade - we don't care about performance, but about usability, and that often means putting one more layer at the top.\n- It seems to me there are quite a few projects on here that are being actively worked on, so I don't feel like it is all talk and no work!"

We should use <#CCL5VVBAN|share-your-work> more! I enjoy following it, and wish there was more, and that I could get a sense for how fast different projects are progressing.\n\nReturning to this subject, I've been on the Handmade Discord for a while, but I've had trouble getting into it. <@UBN9AFS0N> I had trouble following this comment of yours as well:\n\n&gt; Kind of the opposite happens here, the projects that are active on two minute week are either low level (mu, uCISC), done in C++ (maudio) or javascript based (instadeq, flow editor)\nYou said later, \"not the opposite actually,\" so I'm curious what you meant here. I'm curious where it overlaps and is in tension with how I think about it: Handmade is about the present of software. High- vs low-level feels like a red herring here. Handmade is about existing programmers trying to tailor existing tools to their needs in often quite short-term, tactical ways. It's not clear that there's a lot of reflection or discussion of how to grow the tent.\n\nThen again, it may well be that this is the way that wins out in the end. Maybe existing tools are good enough, they just need more community to coalesce around them. I'm glad somebody is exploring that branch of the evolutionary tree.\n\nThis is a weak opinion. I haven't followed many channels on the Discord, and the project pages outside Discord feel like a maze. As a result, it's often difficult for me to know what a channel is talking about; I feel like I'm entering in the middle of a conversation. I've tried asking for links a couple of times but not had much of a response. People here seem to put more effort into being understood by new audience members.\n\nThanks for the links to Dion on <#C5U3SEW6A|linking-together>! I've often seen it mentioned but hadn't found the project page yet. Looking forward to checking it out.",

I'm curious where it overlaps and is in tension with how I think about it: Handmade is about the present of software. High- vs low-level feels like a red herring here. Handmade is about existing programmers trying to tailor existing tools to their needs in often quite short-term, tactical ways. It's not clear that there's a lot of reflection or discussion of how to grow the tent.\n\nThen again, it may well be that this is the way that wins out in the end. Maybe existing tools are good enough, they just need more community to coalesce around them. I'm glad somebody is exploring that branch of the evolutionary tree.\n\nThis is a weak opinion. I haven't followed many channels on the Discord, and the project pages outside Discord feel like a maze. As a result, it's often difficult for me to know what a channel is talking about; I feel like I'm entering in the middle of a conversation. I've tried asking for links a couple of times but not had much of a response. People here seem to put more effort into being understood by new audience members.\n\nThanks for the links to Dion on "

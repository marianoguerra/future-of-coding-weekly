The most powerful scientific models we have are expressed as specifications, not algorithms, and programming languages are not a good medium to express them.\n\n<@U8A5MS6R1> just shared a paper by Terry Winograd on Twitter (<https:\/\/twitter.com\/chatur_shalabh\/status\/1331410504204488706>) that addresses this point very well (and is 40 years old!). It describes \"Three domains of descriptions\" of software systems. Scientific concepts, models, and ideas belong to the \"subject domain\", whereas code is designed for the \"domain of implementation\".\n\nHowever, if you define \"code\" in a wider sense that includes formal languages designed for other purposes than \"programming\", then I agree with everything you say :wink:",

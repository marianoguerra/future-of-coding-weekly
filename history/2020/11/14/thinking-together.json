Nim has lisp style macros, and liberally uses high level rewrite passes to generate optimized code. For example, Nim has the concept of an <https:\/\/nim-lang.org\/docs\/manual.html#iterators-and-the-for-statement-first-class-iterators|inline iterator>, which gives you convenient python style iterator syntax, but rewrites the code into a more optimal for loop. <https:\/\/nim-lang.org\/docs\/asyncdispatch.html|Async \/ Await> in Nim is entirely built as a macro library. But, as interesting as those examples are, any language with a macro system can accomplish something similar in theory.\n\nWhat is interesting about Nim is that it is purely a \"compiler front end\" to use compiler terminology. Nim does not produce assembly language. It produces C code that can then be fed into any C compiler. This means the output is fairly high level, and while it's not \"pretty\" or  \"elegant\", it's inspectable! You can read it and understand what is going on.",

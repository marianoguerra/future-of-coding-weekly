Though there are no fancy demos this time around, can see this as taking some neat moves that will pay off in the (immediate) future. Also carving out the problem space to just map projections for now is a smart move. Will help you focus on solving bug problems one step at a time. All in all, pretty promising and would love to see what comes out.\n\nOne question I had was: How would you declare constants and static snapshot of a dynamic thing in this environment? Like a constant is a variable that doesnt change, so thats easy to pull off but with re: static, I mean something that was dynamic and bound previously, but now you need to reify the result as a sort of new input to another function but not with the bindings. Is there a way to bind and unbind variables like this? I could supply an example if that description was not clear.",

You want to extract out this value and make it a static thing instead of it acting in the continuum. How would you accomplish that? Like say you have x = 10 points with x, y coordinates. Then you perform, reflectHorizontally(rotate(x)) generating a set of points. My impression with the two demos is that the value x is bound continuously throughout the transformation in the env. Now, you want to extract out, elements 1,2, and 7 out of the result and then store it as y which you will pipe through another set of transformations to produce z. So rewinding the story so far, we have x morphing into y morphing into z. Now, in a typical bound set up, the changes in x will be continuously mirrored to y and z. What I meant by static is, y when reified\/extracted out of this abstract chain, will become a sort of end product of the transformation of x and  then become a non-live value changing\/parametrizing which will change z independent of transformations that can happen to x. Hope the use case I had in mind is conveyed with this.",

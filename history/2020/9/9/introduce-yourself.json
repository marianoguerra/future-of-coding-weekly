That won't be 100% strict, I am afraid, but that's where we want to start and see how we can evolve from there.\n\nThe second question is something that will be up to the community and the rules they will create for the system. Since most arbitrary code snippets from a random framework would pull in most of the rest of the framework, they probably won't do well in the system. More self-contained functions are the goal. Also, no state means that most frameworks are excluded.\n\nHope that makes sense.",

That won't be 100% strict, I am afraid, but that's where we want to start and see how we can evolve from there.\n\nThe second question is something that will be up to the community and the rules they will create for the system. Since most arbitrary code snippets from a random framework would pull in most of the rest of the framework, they probably won't do well in the system. More self-contained functions are the goal. Also, no state means that most frameworks are excluded.\n\nHope that makes sense."

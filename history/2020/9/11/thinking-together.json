As <@UGLSY9X3J> pointed out above, and as I tried to say in the overflow thread :arrow_right_hook::\n\n* The line between 'manual' and 'automated' is fuzzy on the computer. If I switch windows and type a command on the shell, I'm still making use of automation. Just less of it.\n* Adding levels of automation _always_ has costs. If it seems always a good idea to you, just wait a few years. We can improve lots of things here, but it's just not a reasonable goal to aim for \"adding levels of automation should always improve life\". There will always be situations where doing something manual is simpler, faster, less alienating. Start developing some warm and fuzzy feeling for doing things manually.\n* Desire for automation is subjective to some extent, as you pointed out in your first comment.\n\nI'd say join me over here where the goal isn't automation but comprehension. Practice throwing kicks not because kicks are always a good idea, but just so you build up judgment on _when_ to use a kick, and so you can do a lot more with a single kick when the moment arrives.\n\n(Movie recommendation: <https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0061770>)",

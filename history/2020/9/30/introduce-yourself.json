I'm one of the founders of 3Box, where we've been building a 'decentralized firebase' that lets apps and services store data with users rather than on siloed servers. We're now focused on <http:\/\/ceramic.network|Ceramic Network> - a verifiable information network and 'dataweb' (as opposed to siloed database) - and <http:\/\/IDX.XYZ|identity index> library for managing identities, users, and other information across any app and platform.\n\nWe're really aimed at helping infrastructure and developers that are ushering in a more open, composable, connected web -- which is so many of you here. Happy to talk about anything related to identity, dweb and composable apps and looking forward to continuing to see and learn from your projects and thinking :slightly_smiling_face:",

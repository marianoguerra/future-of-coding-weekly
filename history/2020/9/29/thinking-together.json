Take dplyr, for example: that you can type `data.frame(apples=1:5, pears=6:10) %&gt;% mutate(fruit = apples + pears)`  to compute `z`  is a big win for ergonomics. Alternatives like `df.fruit = df.apples + df.pears`  get real old real fast, in my unfortunately-extensive experience with Pandas. And `mutate(\"fruit = apples + pears\")`  limits you to whatever operators are allowed in that stringly mini-dsl.\n\nBut allowing unquoted names has a tradeoff: it disfavours _programming_ in the tidyverse. What if I'd like to write a function that does the same 'analysis', but is generic over column names?\n\n```add_fruit &lt;- function(df, col1, col2, colresult) {\n    # usage: addfruit(mydf, \"apples\", \"pears\", \"fruit\")\n    df %&gt;% mutate(colresult = col1 + col2\n}```\nwould get me an error saying 'no `col1` in `df`', and I'd need to do some contortions to make clear that I want to use the contents of `col1` as a name, rather than the name `col1`  itself.\n\nOther languages that make the same tradeoff:\n• the various shell languages (sh, fish, PowerShell), where bare words are literal, variables are $something, and the meaning of a literal is determined by the invoked command's argument parser. Like R, a language focused on interactive use.\n• Tcl, too: first word is a command, later words are command arguments, bare words are taken literally, $something denotes the contents of the 'something' variable. And Tcl, too, is focused on providing an interactive shell over lower libraries -- and even on making such shells easy to create.",

Logic programming offers nothing new in terms of end results. What it offers is a mental model and decades of research in algorithms on how to fit problems into it.\n\nGiven all that, I would still use a none logic based front end framework\/library today. Why? because the ecosystem built around them isn't as rich. I'm worried that's  because little to no discussion is generated around merging these two fields.\n\n\nThe browser application ecosystem is ripe with places where applications of decades old algorithms and models could have huge impacts on peoples lives today. The future of programming is going to read more like math from a decade ago, we don't need to discover it, its already there, we need to apply it.",

Often we do the planning in our heads and write out the plan by hand, but can situational calculus help us use the computer to do this planning if we specify the high level goals? It could even provide multiple altenrnative plans and maybe we could choose? Have you seen examples of such use?"

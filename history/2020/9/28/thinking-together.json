Imagine that for every function, you have on wiki page, where the wiki page describes what the functions does, it's formal parameters (input types, output types), etc. Each function can have several implementations associated with it (which can be built either from other functions in the wiki or be natively written in a programming language, and we plan to support many of those) and also tests. Maybe the best way to understand the project is to take a look at some of the early mockups. [3]\n\nThe functions are meant to be functional, i.e. not to rely on state (well, not too much - they are able to call out to the Web, e.g. to look up information in Wikidata, etc., so in some way, the Web does provide state. We will need to figure that part out. There's a lot of open questions around that).\n\nThe type system is also in the wiki, so that it is extensible by the community.\n\nWe are in very early development (and, in fact, hiring!)

That was what led me to write the first purpose-built Semantic Web-style Triplestore. The sort of \"global personal assistant\" was scraping data from email, contacts, appointments, browsing, &c, and storing everything it learnt in a per user TripleStore to allow inferences, lookup, and so on. There was a temporal aspect to the data which allowed one to make \"what was that website I visited about topic X within the last week?\" sort of queries."

You actually use the term \"abstract programming language\", which sounds fitting.\n\nBasically your abstract programming language is a data model and a function composition model. The data model seems to be a slight extension of JSON though I wonder about some details, in particular number semantics. JSON only specifies number syntax, to which JavaScript adds floating-point semantics, which I think is a bad choice. The function composition model seems to be basically eager evaluation, but I wonder if there is a mechanism for error handling, which I'd expect to be practically necessary, though not in principle. Type checking would also have to be a part of the function composition model, and I guess that implies choosing a uniform type system (nominal vs. structural, parametricity, ...).\n\nAs for scientific models, I'd say their place is data structures in Wikidata, not functions in Wikilambda. That doesn't preclude having associated executable code for illustration, running demos, etc. BTW, that's how Leibniz is implemented in Racket. It's not code that compiles to functions, but an embedded data language that compiles to a few data structures representing symbols, terms, rules, and equations. I could easily map the data structures to Wikidata and write Wikilambda functions for rendering. Which might actually make sense one day, though my immediate use case is doing research, rather than documenting scientific concensus in Wikipedia.\n\nBTW, I wonder if you know about Unison (<https:\/\/www.unisonweb.org\/>), which has some overlap with your idea for Wikilambda as well, in particular the separation of the actual code from the identifiers that name pieces of code and data. That leads to a rather different development workflow, which may be adapted to Wikilambda as well.",

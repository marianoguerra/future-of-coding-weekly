Much respect to him for his work. I need to look up Greg Bryant, thanks for the pointer!\n\nI am working on and off on my mathematical skills to see how I can represent these ideas well. This is why I started the research on notation to see how historically they have helped us in expressing that other realm that we have inside us: <https:\/\/github.com\/prathyvsh\/notation> I am pursuing it under a feel that there is a good ROI from having a good fitness between the content\/context relationship for the constructs you device to ground these forms.\n\nWill definitely share when I have some clarity on this.

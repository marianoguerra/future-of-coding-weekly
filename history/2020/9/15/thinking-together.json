        "text": "<@UDKTZSD6H> regarding your 3 suggested resources:\n\n*1 Universal Algebra* — this seems to be what I was hoping for when I started getting into category theory (we even had a study group here). For category theory I concluded that the basics are great to know, and they btw align with Christopher Alexander's intent with pattern languages, which also state that patterns are independent from the actual entities and are completely defined by the relations between them. But as I'm still more interested in applying that knowledge to actual problems, category theory then quickly seems to drift off into abstract math land where it seems more like an entertaining thinking sport for a higher math priesthood.\n\nAnyway, Universal Algebra: I'm familiar with orders, groups, sets, monoids, etc. If I'm specifically interested in the mathematical definition and transformations between lists and trees and lattices, do you have any great introductory pointers to read\/watch?\n\n*2 Topology* — I guess I need to brush up on topology. Will read that blog post.\n\n*3 Recursion + Chomsky* — If I understand you correctly, I think you're interpreting what I said already on a more abstract level than I meant it, which is interesting. That's the main problem discussing these things: we talk about abstraction all the time and we do it all the time, but we don't really have a sense for which level of abstraction we're at right now. We can only determine where we are in the hierarchy of abstractions in a relative way, by pointing out what's above or below. There is no stable absolute coordinate system that's granular enough. Feels a lot like category theory.\n\nThe way I just recently started to understand Alexander's pattern language, seems even more down-to-earth, pragmatic application of a grammar with certain terminals and non-terminals, which form a hierarchy. The point is that such a language can be described with a finite amount of elements (or patterns, in Alexander's case), but can be combined to construct an infinite amount of resulting artifacts (built structures, in Alexander's case). Through the language we get hierarchy, so there are patterns that apply to different levels of scale (up from patterns for towns, through patterns for houses, to patterns for ornaments). These correspond to where in the syntax tree they are; higher-level (town) non-terminals often rely on several more layers of lower-level (house) non-terminals until you finally resolve to a terminal (~ ornaments?).\nSo that's all pretty basic generative grammars stuff.\n\nAlexander doesn't like recursion, because there isn't really an infinite sequence anywhere in nature. It all begins and ends somewhere. So it doesn't map perfectly. But I'm willing to consider that an \"implementation detail\". :slightly_smiling_face:\nBut I expect more clarity on this from his Nature of Order series, which I will finally attempt to read soon.",

Yeah, folds and unfolds (Origami programming I think it’s called? <https:\/\/archive.alvb.in\/msc\/11_infomtpt\/papers\/origami-programming_Gibbons.pdf>) points at that deep correspondence between Initial\/Final (co)algebras that I have been talking about. I think the idea here is that you can modularize everything down to a sequence of unary\/binary function and then talk about folding them to get data and unfolding the data to get the sequence back. This I think is a powerful idea and continuations I think are like things that does these sporadically and jumps to another part (like goto) to create a computational structure. Bird\/Meerteens\/Gibbons seem to be the people who pioneer work in this domain. Their Algorithmics movement I think is a great advancement in this direction.

I see Profunctor Optics have slowly turned into a central focus point among theorists.\n\nOne of the central things I think in computing and most of mathematics is the idea of duality. So that defunctionalization\/refunctionalization as much as I understand is a way to reify a continuation so that it can be treated as a datastructure. If my guess is not far off, what you get is the above mentioned algebra structure which the folds and unfolds work over. The beauty about algebra is that you get a lot of nice properties which yields itself to different ways of instrumenting into the program. Like associativity guarantees that the brackets around operations a(bc)(de) can be moved around giving (ab)(cd)e meaning you can execute each of those functions in any context (any thread when mapped to a computational substrate) and then rejoin the result to get back the original one. Mathematicians go further and generalize that to ideas like Tamari lattice: <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tamari_lattice> where all such orderings are studied and their properties are investigated. So this bigger perspective of looking at things gives an idea to locate where the dualities arise and then instrument your program accordingly. Writing all that makes me wish there was an interactive space to show how all these things fit together.\n\nThanks a tonne for your input and I’ll definitely look through them and respond back when I have better clarity on these.",

I need to examine the exact mathematical properties that create this transformation, but I think it is when boundaries merge together around a center.

I largely came to the conclusion that they do program for themselves, it just takes the form of personal sites and side projects, rather than the type of thing I was looking for), I got a couple of requests for some examples of what I mean, so I decided to start a thread to share customizations.\n\nThere are three categories I had in mind when I started that thread:\n\n1. Using programming to support software development with things like continuous integration, and automated testing (these are both actually popular, but in my experience programmers tend not to like working on them very much).\n2. Solving problems programming problems programmatically, e.g., writing shell scripts or using  text editor marcos (<https:\/\/www.emacswiki.org\/emacs\/KeyboardMacros>) to perform a refactor that isn't supported by refactoring tools.\n3. Writing scripts and customizations to help improve your own personal workflow.\n\nI think of those three, only the last one that I think only #3, personal customizations, needs examples to understand, so that's what this thread is about. I'm going to try to share a mix of things that I think would be helpful to any programmer, and things that are very specific to my own workflow.\n\nI'd love for anyone else to share their own customizations. I'd also love to hear of people think these types of customizations would be helpful (or not helpful) for the way they work. (Or also just if my presentation of them isn't clear.) Cheers!",

I largely came to the conclusion that they do program for themselves, it just takes the form of personal sites and side projects, rather than the type of thing I was looking for), I got a couple of requests for some examples of what I mean, so I decided to start a thread to share customizations.\n\nThere are three categories I had in mind when I started that thread:\n\n1. Using programming to support software development with things like continuous integration, and automated testing (these are both actually popular, but in my experience programmers tend not to like working on them very much).\n2. Solving problems programming problems programmatically, e.g., writing shell scripts or using  text editor marcos ("

Writing scripts and customizations to help improve your own personal workflow.\n\nI think of those three, only the last one that I think only #3, personal customizations, needs examples to understand, so that's what this thread is about. I'm going to try to share a mix of things that I think would be helpful to any programmer, and things that are very specific to my own workflow.\n\nI'd love for anyone else to share their own customizations. I'd also love to hear of people think these types of customizations would be helpful (or not helpful) for the way they work. (Or also just if my presentation of them isn't clear.) Cheers!"

        "text": "For me (and many clojure programmers I know). There is no distinction between working at the repl and editing the source code. I build the program in the file and have an active running repl connected to that file\/project. In fact, I can even load up multiple projects in one repl and work on changes across them. So if I have some library I depend on I can load up it's code, edit it, evaluate it, and have those changes reflected live in my program. \n\nI never do any copy and paste. I am working with a live running program and I can do all sorts of things with that. One example is testing out failure modes and simulating in real time systems going down and coming back up, watching how the system handles it. \n\nAnother is what I've called interactive integration tests. I have some namespace of code that is meant to be run at the repl. It imports parts of my apps and lets me combine them in various ways to test the live working system, but fully parameterizable. \n\nThis flow is the main reason I enjoy programming in clojure so much.

So if I have some library I depend on I can load up it's code, edit it, evaluate it, and have those changes reflected live in my program. \n\nI never do any copy and paste. I am working with a live running program and I can do all sorts of things with that.

The way I see it:\n\n* Your environment allows showing values of variables anywhere.\n* For historical reasons, it does this by using a REPL behind the scenes.\n* Since there's a REPL, it exposes it to you that you _could_ use.\n\nBut as you said, you don't normally use the REPL. That says to me you have something _better_. There's a spatial component here that sounds awesome. While it's technically correct to call it a read-eval-print-loop, I think that understates the value.",

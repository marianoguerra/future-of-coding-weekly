How will their thinking be changed by using your system? Why should they turn to it, instead of something else? Don’t think about _how_ you’ll do this yet, just *focus on human needs* that need meeting.\n\nFrom there, you can start to sketch out ideas (I’d start on paper, as it’s the most free form). Remember the needs and contexts of the people you’re trying to help! Are they best met with text files (and things like git, other source code tools) or are they better met with something more graphical? (Or really far out: are they best met with an entirely new kind of computer??)\n\nAt this point, I like to move into something more like a drawing tool (I use Sketch on the Mac) that lets me mock things up and write notes, spatially. I like to imagine different kinds of UIs for solving issues, and then I can write notes along side them, etc.\n\nAs far as actually prototyping these things, that’s where I struggle to do so rapidly (as far as real working systems go). But I think there’s something very powerful (and cheap!) about mocking things up in a drawing tool (or in a text file — but beware, if you do everything in a text file, you’ll probably narrow your ability to work on programming UX things provided by your environment)",

Remember the needs and contexts of the people you’re trying to help! Are they best met with text files (and things like git, other source code tools) or are they better met with something more graphical? (Or really far out: are they best met with an entirely new kind of computer??)\n\nAt this point, I like to move into something more like a drawing tool (I use Sketch on the Mac) that lets me mock things up and write notes, spatially. I like to imagine different kinds of UIs for solving issues, and then I can write notes along side them, etc.\n\nAs far as actually prototyping these things, that’s where I struggle to do so rapidly (as far as real working systems go). But I think there’s something very powerful (and cheap!) about mocking things up in a drawing tool (or in a text file — but beware, if you do everything in a text file, you’ll probably narrow your ability to work on programming UX things provided by your environment)"

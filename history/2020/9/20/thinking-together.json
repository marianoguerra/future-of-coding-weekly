My post last night on <#C0120A3L30R|two-minute-week> (<https:\/\/futureofcoding.slack.com\/archives\/C0120A3L30R\/p1600587602007800>) triggered enough unexpected thinking together to get me to write up my recent attempts and try to trigger more.\n\nWe all simulate programs in our heads. The activity seems to break down into two major use cases:\n* Forward path: Extracting functions out of arbitrary computations.\n* Backward path: Imagining the execution of arbitrary computations containing function calls.\n\nThe forward path fits very well with ideas like starting with concrete examples and emphasizing data at all times. Nobody should ever have to start with a function definition. Instead, start with an example computation like: `18 * 9\/5 + 32`, and incrementally end up at a function like `celsius-to-fahrenheit`. The backward path fits with various metaphors for debugging programs. Debug by print, debug by step, time-travel debugging. A key concern is how to _uncoil_ static computations (loops, recursion) into dynamic metaphors (traces, stack frames, interactive movements).\n\nPostfix expressions fit beautifully with the backward path. As the demo of Brief (<https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=R3MNcA2dpts>) showed, execution is already quite uncoiled, with no backward jumps. While the Brief demo didn't show it (it's easy to spot where the presenter plays computer in their heads), it's reasonable to imagine a way to drill down into function calls, replacing words with their definitions. By contrast, conventional expressions -- tree-shaped and using names -- immediately throw up impediments in understanding _what happens first_.\n\nHowever, the forward path is thornier:\n1. It's common to claim that point-free programs make it easy to factor out new definitions, but that's only true when the definition consists of consecutive words. Consider how you would go from `* 3 3` to a definition of `square`, or from `3 4 + 5 *` to a definition of `(a+b)*c`.\n2. After they're extracted, point-free functions are harder to understand. What does the stack need to look like at the start? How many words, what types, how many words consumed, all these questions require simulating programs in your head. Or a manual comment.\n\nThis was the idea maze in my head until I saw LoGlo (<https:\/\/loglo.app\/2020-06-16>). The cool idea here has taken me weeks to articulate: lines have names and get separate stacks. Forth typically writes to names within lines with words like `!`. Limiting definitions to one per line strikes me as an advance. And having names gives us a way to make Forth words less point-free. I start imagining flows like turning `* 3 3` into `* x x` using two 'rename' operations, and then turning the entire line into a new function. Like, imagine a UI with a code side on the left, and a scratch computation on the right:\n\n```              │\n              │  x: 3\n              │  * x x\n              │```\nAfter defining a function it might look like this:\n\n```              │\n   : sq x     │  sq 3\n        * x x │\n              │```\nNotice how the definition of `x:` above gets replaced by the call to `sq` below. That's kinda pleasing.\n\nBut there's issues. This manipulation requires modifying definitions of free variables. Worse, I ended up with the function call in _prefix_ order. Trying to make things consistent got me stuck up on a tree with a 2D layout until I noticed I'd lost the benefits of postfix that got me on this road in the first place. I'll include it here just in case it sparks ideas for others, but I'm starting to think it's a dead end.\n\nAnyways, that's where I am, still looking for a representation that's easy to uncoil and where inlining function calls is a 'smooth' visualization.",

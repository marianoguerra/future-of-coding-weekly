I hope to avoid to create a new programming language, but to get away with composition of existing functions. The functions themselves can be implemented in any programming language the system supports, and whereas we will start only with one or two languages, we hope to considerably expand that.\nTypes such as positive integer would be defined by the community, just as functions are. But no, it doesn't require dynamic checks, and in fact I expect most checks to be static - it just means that you'd either have underflows and overflows, or that you define your functions accordingly (i.e. natural subtract instead of subtraction). So, no new programming language, but yes to composition. The prototype implementation at <https:\/\/github.com\/google\/abstracttext\/> might be helpful to dive further.\nRegarding the scientists to share models together, the thinking is more about \"here's an executable version of that function we defined here\", less about actually doing reasoning over the models itself. I am also not very sure how well this would work with an infrastructure as Wikilambda - probably something that is more geared towards such use cases such as leibniz would fare better. If I understand it right, you are doing a slightly different, higher level work of actually capturing and working with the whole model, whereas Wikilambda only wants to execute functions with specific inputs. Having said that, I would love to see how these two spaces could interact, I sense there is a lot of potential there - but it's not an area I have fully thought through.\nThose are great comments and pointers, thank you!

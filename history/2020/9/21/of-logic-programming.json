Datalog is a *very* simple logic language, which makes it easy to understand, but accordingly it's so limited that you can't really build much with it. In an attempt to address this, people have gone in two directions: extend Datalog with new features, or embed Datalog into a traditional programming language. I think the former is far more exciting.\n\nYou can play with Datalog using any Prolog engine, because Datalog is technically just a subset of Prolog. Unfortunately for developing non-trivial Datalog programs you really need an extension of Datalog, and I don't know any ready-made extensions that I can recommend. I certainly wouldn't recommend Prolog!",

In an attempt to address this, people have gone in two directions: extend Datalog with new features, or embed Datalog into a traditional programming language. I think the former is far more exciting.\n\nYou can play with Datalog using any Prolog engine, because Datalog is technically just a subset of Prolog. Unfortunately for developing non-trivial Datalog programs you really need an extension of Datalog, and I don't know any ready-made extensions that I can recommend. I certainly wouldn't recommend Prolog!"

I think it has to do with the total order requirement on the character sequence, which makes ranges work, but then as soon as you start handling ranges as their own entities with their own operations defined on them, you are introducing another… hmm… _layer_ that has different requirements.

I wish I could explain it better. Right now it just _feels_ to me that there are some use cases, like cut &amp; paste of arbitrary ranges which don't correspond exactly to layer range boundaries, that can't be represented unambiguously with a pure linear sequence + a set of ranges into that sequence. It could probably be worked around though with some heuristics that'll translate the edge cases into weird\/unintuitive behavior from the user's perspective, and perhaps that's totally acceptable.\n\nBut I'd love to be proven wrong and maybe there's a better way!

Which is a slightly modified Scratch with new extensions.\n\nThis project can be seen as a first step for me to gather user feedback and experiment things on \"easier programming\".\n\nUsing Scratch gives a ready to use programming environment for \"non-experts\" and adding new extensions and modifying Scratch a bit allows to quickly experiment new use cases, new tools, new way to program. Of course at some point Scratch will be limiting, but I am sure there is enough room for fun experiments!\n\nSo far, I have added some AI extensions and a <https:\/\/www.croquet.io\/|Croquet> extension. An AI extension that uses <https:\/\/teachablemachine.withgoogle.com\/|Teachable Machine> models for image classification and an other for face recognition (based on ml5.js, more to come from this library). The Croquet one is very experimental but it is usable for very basic inter-project communication, and the main contribution (nearly all) comes from Yoshiki Ohshima, of the Croquet team.\n\nI have some ideas for new extensions (like, why not, generating HTML\/DOM, and, why not, à la Vue.js) and would love to hear from you if you think of something to experiments with some Scratch \"constraints\".\n\nAnd of course any feedback and thoughts are very welcome! :pray: :relaxed:",

Which is a slightly modified Scratch with new extensions.\n\nThis project can be seen as a first step for me to gather user feedback and experiment things on \"easier programming\".\n\nUsing Scratch gives a ready to use programming environment for \"non-experts\" and adding new extensions and modifying Scratch a bit allows to quickly experiment new use cases, new tools, new way to program. Of course at some point Scratch will be limiting, but I am sure there is enough room for fun experiments!\n\nSo far, I have added some AI extensions and a "

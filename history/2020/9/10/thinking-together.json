E.g., it seems to me that things are like personal sites and side projects (sharing) are much more common than using programming to improve personal productivity. Correspondingly, it seems to me that the most fruitful area in end-user programming would likely be in making it as easy as possible for non-programmers to share their creations with others. I think the history of the web also reflects this, with the move towards services that remove the technical hurdles to sharing (e.g., Twitter\/Medium, for better or worse) and the current no-code movement.",

E.g., it seems to me that things are like personal sites and side projects (sharing) are much more common than using programming to improve personal productivity. Correspondingly, it seems to me that the most fruitful area in end-user programming would likely be in making it as easy as possible for non-programmers to share their creations with others. I think the history of the web also reflects this, with the move towards services that remove the technical hurdles to sharing (e.g., Twitter\/Medium, for better or worse) and the current no-code movement."

One link from my OP above is relevant: <https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@akkartik\/103994830568601931>. My argument goes like this:\n\n* Settings often grow in an unruly fashion compared to codebases. We're more careful about organizing modules in a repo than we are in adding knobs to a config file. Even though the modules are internal details and the config file is externally visible.\n* Settings in config files often depend on each other in subtle, hard-to-debug ways.\n* Creating packages to manage customizations requires dealing with these dependencies. That creates a lot of bloat to sense lots of different combinations of settings and behave appropriately.\n* The bloat hinders further customization. People start to rely more on packages created by others, and the muscle of doing your own customization atrophies.\n\nBottomline: If you make something look polished, people will assume someone else should make it. If you make it look half-assed, it will encourage, even _beg for_, helping oneself. This is a case where worse is actually better, not just pragmatically but really.",

We're more careful about organizing modules in a repo than we are in adding knobs to a config file. Even though the modules are internal details and the config file is externally visible.\n* Settings in config files often depend on each other in subtle, hard-to-debug ways.\n* Creating packages to manage customizations requires dealing with these dependencies. That creates a lot of bloat to sense lots of different combinations of settings and behave appropriately.\n* The bloat hinders further customization. People start to rely more on packages created by others, and the muscle of doing your own customization atrophies.\n\nBottomline: If you make something look polished, people will assume someone else should make it. If you make it look half-assed, it will encourage, even "

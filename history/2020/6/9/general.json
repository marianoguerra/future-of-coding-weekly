This community is organized around three stream-type media (see <https:\/\/hapgood.us\/2015\/10\/17\/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral\/amp\/|this essay> for stream vs. garden): a podcast, a Slack, and a newsletter. These are media for exchanging information, not for collaborating. Garden-type media that support collaboration are, unfortunately, much less numerous. Basically we have Wikis and Git repositories. Someone needs to set up a garden and oversee its evolution. That's work, and unfortunately not highly valued nowadays. Ask Open Source maintainer for testimonials. I suspect this is the main obstacle to be solved.\n2. What we all have in common is dissatisfaction with the present state of the tech world. That doesn't mean we have the same goals, nor the same ideas about reaching our goals. I doubt we could all productively collaborate. So we need to aim for \"getting things done\" communities (plural) that overlap with this one but which are not identical.",

It’s an analogy, and I think a pretty good one. You’ll love my Harry Potter one above :wink:\n\nOn the topic of visual thinkers — It’s naive to think that anyone can create the same visual constructs that every visual person understands. The way I visualize complex logic *is not* the same as how You visualize it. Just like how we have a hundred programming languages focusing on different complexities; visuals are the same. There is great depths and domains to tackle — there is no universally understood graph\/visual. I’m deeply concerns for those building visual tools for that reason alone: the way they see the visual space is not ubiquitous, and I would argue more unique than text. My argument is based off research and discussions with individuals in this FoC as well as leaders in the industry. I won’t name them, but there are several companies that understand their visual representations of logic *must* change as their product is just as confusing as programming is today… it’s just shinier.",

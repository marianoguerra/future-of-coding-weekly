                "text": "The Amiga is a family of personal computers introduced by Commodore in 1985. The original model was part of a series of 16\/32- and 32-bit computers that featured 256 KB or more of RAM, mouse-based GUIs, and significantly improved graphics and audio over 8-bit systems. This wave included the Atari ST—released the same year—Apple's Macintosh, and later the Apple IIGS. Based on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor, the Amiga differed from its contemporaries through the inclusion of custom hardware to accelerate graphics and sound, including sprites and a blitter, and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS.\nThe Amiga 1000 was released in July 1985, but a series of production problems kept it from becoming widely available until early 1986. The best selling model, the Amiga 500, was introduced in 1987 and became one of the leading home computers of the late 1980s and early 1990s with four to six million sold. The A3000 was introduced in 1990, followed by the A500+, and the A600 in March 1992. Finally, the A1200 and the A4000 were released in late 1992. The platform became particularly popular for gaming and programming demos. It also found a prominent role in the desktop video, video production, and show control business, leading to video editing systems such as the Video Toaster. The Amiga's native ability to simultaneously play back multiple digital sound samples made it a popular platform for early tracker music software. The relatively powerful processor and ability to access several megabytes of memory enabled the development of 3D rendering packages, including LightWave 3D, Imagine, Aladdin4D, TurboSilver and Traces, a predecessor to Blender.\nAlthough early Commodore advertisements attempt to cast the computer as an all-purpose business machine, especially when outfitted with the Amiga Sidecar PC compatibility add-on, the Amiga was most commercially successful as a home computer, with a wide range of games and creative software. Poor marketing and the failure of the later models to repeat the technological advances of the first systems meant that the Amiga quickly lost its market share to competing platforms, such as the fourth generation game consoles, Macintosh, and the rapidly dropping prices of IBM PC compatibles, which gained 256-color VGA graphics in 1987. Commodore ultimately went bankrupt in April 1994 after a version of the Amiga packaged as a game console, the Amiga CD32, failed in the marketplace.\nSince the demise of Commodore, various groups have marketed successors to the original Amiga line, including Genesi, Eyetech, ACube Systems Srl and A-EON Technology. Likewise, AmigaOS has influenced replacements, clones and compatible systems such as MorphOS, AmigaOS 4 and AROS.",

The former are artists and technical people who are actually building the movie itself, and the latter are software engineers who are building and maintaining the high-powered software it takes to make the movie.\n\nProduction often cobbles things together with hastily-coded scripts or node networks, and it's often fragile, ugly, duplicated— most complaints you could level against \"bad engineering\". Generally it's done under a deadline, though, in service of getting the best possible picture on the screen, and knowing the audience won't care about how the sausage is made.\n\nThis other person was griping about a script they had to maintain (and— probably with cause— had several of those complaints), and was arguing that production TDs shouldn't be allowed to write code if they couldn't engineer it properly, and that this stuff should be given to the tools department.\n\nBut the thing is, the tools engineers (and there are ~100 of them) all have their hands completely full on large-scale, long-term projects that are necessary to hit the highest level technical goals of a film, and beyond that, to keep the entire studio on the technological cutting edge. New projects are careful negotiations between all the films' needs and the tools department's limited resources. Bidding these projects takes time, and often they wait in line for several weeks (or months) behind critical bugs and features.\n\nIf tools engineers had to do all \"production\" engineering, that work would simply never get done— or the studio would need an engineering department three times as big, and for the exact same result on the screen.\n\nBashed-together scripts allow technical artists to solve a problem quickly and get back to making the movie. If they had to bid their project to an engineering team, prioritize it, get leadership support, and so on... they'd be waiting for weeks. They'd probably just tediously solve their problem by hand instead, and spend less time making the movie look good.\n\nThe dichotomy frequently isn't \"engineering things cleanly vs. cobbling things messily\", it's \"cobbling things messily vs. not doing them at all\".\n\nIf put into practice, that abstract complaint about the tidiness of how something is done— or gatekeeping about who gets to do it— would result in a worse movie.\n\nI don't have deep experience with Notion, but in general I think this principle extends to the outside world— there are lots of people who are spending hours doing things that should be automated, but there are way more one-off problems than there are engineers to architect tight solutions for each of them. \"Messy and done\" is better than \"not done\" or \"done tediously, at the expense of solving more central problems\".",

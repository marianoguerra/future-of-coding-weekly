From my perspective, the confusion between bit strings and integers began in C (where it was appropriate) but has infected many modern high level languages (where it is not appropriate). The two ideas should be kept separate, because the operations are distinct and the concepts are distinct. In my language (Curv), I started with a \"number\" abstraction, which only supports numeric operations, not bit string operations. Later, I found a need for bit strings (to write hash functions), so I added a separate bit string abstraction, which is actually an array of booleans. So bitwise `and`, `or`, `xor`, and `not` are just those boolean operations extended to work on boolean arrays. For hash functions, I also needed operations to convert between numbers and bit strings, and I needed a bitwise version of integer addition that wraps around (ie, it has ALU semantics). Unlike C, Python or Javascript, my \"bit add\" operation, which only works on bit strings, is distinct from the \"+\" operator that only works on numbers, and they have different semantics.",

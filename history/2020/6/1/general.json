                "text": "```\n- Feature Name: Shrubbery notation\n- Start Date: 2019-10-01\n- RFC PR: [racket\/racket2-rfcs#122](<https:\/\/github.com\/racket\/racket2-rfcs\/pull\/122>)\n\n# Summary\n[summary]: #summary\n\nShrubbery notation is similar to S-expression notation, but instead of\ngenerating fully formed trees, it is intended to partially group input\nfor further enforestation by another parser (e.g., as in Honu). The\nnotation is line- and indentation-sensitive, and the parsed form of a\nshrubbery imposes grouping to ensure that further parsing is\nconsistent with the shrubbery's lines and indentation.\n\n# Motivation\n[motivation]: #motivation\n\nS-expression notation imposes a grouping at the lexeme level that is\nall but guaranteed to be respected by further parsing via macro\nexpansion. One consequence of this lexeme-based grouping is that\nprograms can be pretty-printed and textually traversed in standard\nways.\n\nA traditional use of S-expression notation, however, insists that\n*all* grouping is reflected in the S-expression. Reifying all grouping\nat the lexeme level is so onerous that many practical deployments of\nS-expressions include deviations from the rule, such as keyword-based\narguments or implicit grouping by position (as in various Clojure\nforms).\n\nAnother disadvantage of S-expressions is that many of the parentheses\nare redundant after the expression is pretty-printed, because\nindentation provides the same grouping information in a more\nhuman-readable way. That observation suggests instead relying on line\nbreaks and indentation to impart grouping information, as in Python.\n\nShrubbery notation explores a point in the design space where the\nnotation is\n\n - line- and indentation-sensitive, and\n - intended to constrain grouping but not reflect every detail of grouping.\n\nDeferring complete grouping to another parser relieves a burden on\nreader-level notation. At the same time, line- and\nindentation-sensitive rules constrain parsing to ensure that line\nbreaks and indentation in the source are not misleading.\n\n# Guide-level explanation\n[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation\n\nHere are some example shrubberies. A `:` in the middle of a line is the\nsame as starting a new line with indentation for the part after the\n`:`. (Extra `:`s are allowed, but they are non-standard, and we don't\nuse any extra `:`s here.)\n\n```\ndefine identity(x): x\n\ndefine fib(n):\n  cond\n   | n == 0: 0\n   | n == 1: 1\n   | else: fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)\n\ndefine print_sexp(v):\n  match v\n   | empty: display(\"()\")\n   | cons(a, d):\n       if is_list(d)\n        | display(\"(\")\n          print_sexp(a)\n          for (v = in_list(d)):\n            display(\" \")\n            print_sexp(v)\n          display(\")\")\n        | display(\"(\")\n          print_sexp(a)\n          display(\". \")\n          print_sexp(d)\n          display(\")\")\n   | v: print_atom(v)\n```\n\nForms like `define`, `cond`, and `match` are not specified by\nshrubbery notation, since specifying those forms is up to a language\nthat is built on top of shrubbery notation. Still, shrubbery notation\nis meant to accommodate a particular kind of syntax for nested blocks\n(via indentation or `:`) and conditional branches (via `|`).\n\nIdentifiers are C-style with alphanumerics and underscores. Operators\nare sequences of symbolic characters in the sense of `char-symbolic?`,\nroughly. Numbers are written in some reasonable way distinct from\nidentifiers. No spaces are needed between operators and non-operators,\nso `1+2` and `1 + 2` mean the same thing. Comments are C-style.\n\nThe following tokens are used for grouping, in addition to line breaks\nand indentation:\n\n```\n( ) [ ] { }   ; ,   : |   \\\n```\n\nParentheses, square brackets, and curly braces are used to form groups\nin the obvious way. A `;` or `,` acts as a group separator, even\nwithin a single line. A `:` or `|` treats remaining item on the same\nline like a new indented line, which forms a subgroup. A `\\` continues a\ngroup across a line break.\n\n## Grouping by lines\n\nThe main grouping rule is that sequences on different lines with the\nsame indentation create separate groups, one for each line.\n\n```\nthis is the first group\nthis is the second group\n```\n\nComments and lines with only whitespace are ignored. They don't count\nwhen this document says “the previous line” or “the next line.”\n\n## Grouping by _opener_-_closer_, including blocks\n\nAn _opener_-_closer_ pair `(` and `)`, `[` and `]`, or `{` and `}`\nforms a nested group that can span lines. Within the _opener_-_closer_\npair, separate lines at the same indentation form separate groups.\nWithin `()` or `[]`, groups on separate lines must also be separated\nby `,`.\n\n```\ngroup 1\n[group 2 - subgroup one,\n group 2 - subgroup two,\n (group 2 - subgroup three - subsubgroup A,\n  group 2 - subgroup three - subsubgroup B)]\ngroup 3\ngroup 4 {has a subgroup\n         and another subgroup}\n```\n\nParsing retains whether a subgroup is formed by `()`, `[]`, or `{}`. A\nsubgroup formed by `{` and `}` is also known as a _block_. In the\nabove example, the fourth group has three elements: the identifier\n`group`, the number `4`, and a block that has two groups (each with\nthree identifiers).\n\nAs a special rule, when a group is immediately within a `()` or `[]`\ngroup sequence, the group continues to the next line when that next\nline starts with an operator. This rule allows long expressions with\ninfix operators to be broken across lines more naturally and readably\nthan using `\\`.\n\n```\n(my_favorite_number\n + your_favorite_number\n + their_favorite_numbers)\n```\n\n## Group separators `;` and `,`\n\nA `;` or a `,` separates two groups on the same line. A `;` is allowed\nin any context except between groups immediately within `()` or `[]`.\nA `,` is allowed only to separate groups of an immediate sequence\nwithin `()` or `[]`, and `,` is also required to separate groups\nwitin `()` and `[]`.\n\nThe following two groups are the same:\n\n```\n[(subgroup one, subgroup two,\n  subgroup three),\n {subgroup X; subgroup Y}]\n\n[(subgroup one,\n  subgroup two,\n  subgroup three),\n {subgroup X\n  subgroup Y}]\n```\n\nThese following forms are disllowed, because they use the wrong\nseparator or because a required separator is missing.\n\n\n```\n\/\/ Not allowed\n(1; 2)\n[1; 2]\n{1, 2}\n\n\/\/ Not allowed\n(1\n 2)\n[1\n 2]\n```\n\nThe `;` and `,` separators interact differently with subgroups formed\nby indentation, `:`, and `|`. A `,` closes subgroups as necessary to\nreach an enclosing `()` or `[]`, while a `;` separate groups within a\nnested group sequence. A `;` will never create an empty group. A `,`\nis disallowed if it would create an empty group, except that a traiing\n`,` is allowed.\n\n```\n\/\/ Not allowed\n(, 1)\n(1,, 2)\n\n\/\/ Allowed, but not standard\n(1, 2,)\n```\n\nA trailing `,` is only standard style when the _closer_ that follows is\non its own line.\n\n```\nlist(\n  red,\n  green,\n  blue,\n  orange,\n)\n```\n\n## Grouping by indentation\n\nA sequence of groups has a particular indentation that is determined\nby the first group in the sequence. Subsequent groups in a sequence\nmust start with the same indentation as the first group.\n\nIndentation relative to the current group is equivalent to wrapping\nthe indented lines with `{` and `}`. That is, indentation creates a\nblock. The inserted `{` is placed on the line just before the indented\ngroup, and the `}` is placed just before the line where indentation\nbecomes shallower again. All four of the following groups are the\nsame, each with one block that has two nested groups:\n\n```\nhello:\n  world\n  universe\n\nhello:\n       world\n       universe\n\nhello { world\n        universe }\n\nhello { world ; universe }\n```\n\nAs illustrated in those examples, there is no constraint on how much\nindentation a nested group sequence must use, as long as the indentation\nis more than the enclosing group. Within an _opener_-_closer_ pair, a\nnested group sequence can start at any indentation; it doesn't have to be\nindented to the right of the _opener_.\n\n```\nhello {\n  world\n  universe\n}\n```\n\nIdentation is allowed only on a line where the previous line ends…",

        "text": "A few thoughts from my instruction set design.\n1. My uCISC instructions have an increment flag in them (see <https:\/\/github.com\/grokthis\/ucisc\/blob\/master\/docs\/07_ALU.md#arguments>). This allows you to chain arbitrarily long ALU functions back to back in increments of 16-bits since that is my word size. This works for addition, shifts and similar operations, for example. The increment points it to the next address and the carry flags tell the ALU how to adjust the next op.\n2. You can generalize this by adding a repeater flag to repeat the same operation N times (see the repetition factor here <https:\/\/github.com\/grokthis\/ucisc\/blob\/master\/docs\/05_Instruction_Behaviors.md#flags-register>)\n3. I banned floating point math from my ALU. You can always attach custom hardware to speed up these cases if needed. The problem is that these operations tend to be highly bit width dependent and also orders of magnitude slower in software.\n4. However, repetition does NOT work for ALU operations where the first bit and the last bit affect each other. For example, in multiplication, each bit is effectively multiplied against every other bit. So, for arbitrarily sized numbers you'll need to make multiple passes. Using something like the Karatsuba algorithm (<https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Karatsuba_algorithm>) you could arbitrarily decompose larger operations into multiple sub operations but it's non-linearly scaling. I haven't done the math, but it gets out of control computation very quickly.\n5. Verilog has ALU operations built in with semantics controlling bit width and signed-ness and the effects on the operation. I have found I need to be ultra careful with the results. Adding 8 bit numbers results in a 9th bit. Multiplying to n-bit numbers results in a 2n-bit number. You also have to be careful with what happens when you operate on unequal bit lengths. Verilog's handling of these things might provide some inspiration on how to do what you want.",

                "text": "The Karatsuba algorithm is a fast multiplication algorithm. It was discovered by Anatoly Karatsuba in 1960 and published in 1962. It reduces the multiplication of two n-digit numbers to at most \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          n\n          \n            \n              log\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            ⁡\n            3\n          \n        \n        ≈\n        \n          n\n          \n            1.58\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n^{\\log _{2}3}\\approx n^{1.58}}\n   single-digit multiplications in general (and exactly \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          n\n          \n            \n              log\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            ⁡\n            3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n^{\\log _{2}3}}\n   when n is a power of 2). It is therefore faster than the traditional algorithm, which requires \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          n\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n^{2}}\n   single-digit products. For example, the Karatsuba algorithm requires 310 = 59,049 single-digit multiplications to multiply two 1024-digit numbers (n = 1024 = 210), whereas the traditional algorithm requires (210)2 = 1,048,576 (a speedup of 17.75 times).\nThe Karatsuba algorithm was the first multiplication algorithm asymptotically faster than the quadratic \"grade school\" algorithm.\nThe Toom–Cook algorithm (1963) is a faster generalization of Karatsuba's method, and the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm (1971) is even faster, for sufficiently large n.",

        "text": "In my personal experience, Macromedia Flash was a remarkable tool that took a lot of brilliance with it when it died. It was a _good enough_ programming environment (arguably on par with modern JS, or Lua), but that programming environment was embedded within and subservient to a powerful graphics program. People could (and would) use it just to draw pictures or make animations, never touching the programming features.\n\nSo the absence of a modern equivalent is, I think, one way in which we've actually lost progress. We have Unity and Unreal, but while they do have basic 3d modelling features, they are by no means 3d art tools themselves — you still need to bring your own Blender, so to speak.\n\nThis is why I see potential for visual programming — it's not just a way to make the programming experience more _live_, it's actually a way to make the programming experience embedded within and subservient to the arts. Like Flash, but more so.\n\nI think this sort of \"embed the programming within the domain\" is a useful, subtle inversion of the idea of a DSL. Spreadsheets are this. So I think some of the stagnation has been the relative lack of new initiatives of this type.",

We have Unity and Unreal, but while they do have basic 3d modelling features, they are by no means 3d art tools themselves — you still need to bring your own Blender, so to speak.\n\nThis is why I see potential for visual programming — it's not just a way to make the programming experience more "

Articles about the primacy of “text” as a medium frustrate me because they move the goalposts on what they mean by text, and often are used to justify a world where we continue to edit programs character-by-character in order to produce a single array of characters that pass lexing, parsing, and compilation or interpretation checks.\n\nThis is frustrating. Here’s one of the example quotes from the article:\n\n&gt; _“Human rights are moral principles or norms that describe certain standards of human behaviour, and are regularly protected as legal rights in national and international law.”_\nI’m not sure how to convey that graphically, but I’m also not sure how to define even _a process to find an appropriate semantic model_ for that sentence. Some quick bullet points:\n• The social context for this sentence matters. You could be reading it at a filibuster, an open mic night, or during a debate around a constitutional amendment.

I think the more useful way of looking at the bare reality of how computers get used is that we send them instructions. The tradition is to batch them up in code files and pass them somewhere, then run them by clicking or invoking them on the command line.\n\nOne major frustration I have is that the input for these commands tends to be constrained to appending, concatenating, inserting, and deleting either characters or regular expressions over characters on arrays (really ropes if you want to nerd out about probable data structures—but the user is experience is indistinguishable from arrays) of text that will eventually get parsed. That sucks:\n• There’s clearly a level of direct inefficiency here: we edit text files, so that they can be parsed to data structures (ASTs)—and then attempt to edit those data structures by editing our text files—and we maintain a relationship between those two pieces of state by maintaining a model in our brains, and spot-checking it repeatedly against a parser, typechecker, and manual and automated tests. I’d argue that storyscript *is actually* a conversational interface over a structural editor, that uses a lot of NLP and some clever UX to make the experience very pleasant. Plus all the stuff about connections to services and everything else it’s doing.\n• there are demonstrably more efficient or ergonomic ways of entering many types of data (interactively or not): dropping pins on a map, using a color picker or eyedropper, drawing a box for a screencap or crop, clicking an element on the screen rather than specifying its exact position or some sort of structural selector, etc. \n• In fact, some of these may be more useful for data types that have direct analogues in code and ASTs: do you think there are more tables or maps in all the excel documents in the world or all the code in the world?

                "text": "The Treachery of Images (French: La Trahison des images) is a 1929 painting by surrealist painter René Magritte. It is also known as This is Not a Pipe and The Wind and the Song. Magritte painted it when he was 30 years old. It is on display at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.The painting shows a pipe. Below it, Magritte painted, \"Ceci n'est pas une pipe\", French for \"This is not a pipe\".\n\nThe famous pipe. How people reproached me for it!  And yet, could you stuff my pipe?  No, it's just a representation, is it not? So if I had written on my picture \"This is a pipe\", I'd have been lying!\nThe theme of pipes with the text \"Ceci n'est pas une pipe\" is extended in Les Mots et Les Images, La Clé des Songes, Ceci n'est pas une pipe (L'air et la chanson), The Tune and Also the Words, Ceci n’est pas une pomme, and Les Deux Mystères.The painting is sometimes given as an example of meta message conveyed by paralanguage, like Alfred Korzybski's \"The word is not the thing\" and \"The map is not the territory\", as well as Denis Diderot's This is not a story. One interpretation is that the pipe in the painting is not a pipe, but rather a drawing of a pipe.\nOn December 15, 1929, Paul Éluard and André Breton published an essay about poetry in La Révolution surréaliste (The Surrealist Revolution) as a reaction to the publication by poet Paul Valéry \"Notes sur la poésie\" in Les Nouvelles littéraires of September 28, 1929. When Valéry wrote \"Poetry is a survival\", Breton and Éluard made fun of it and wrote \"Poetry is a pipe\", as a reference to Magritte's <http:\/\/painting.In|painting.In> the same edition of La Révolution surréaliste, Magritte published \"Les mots et les images\" (his founding text which illustrated where words play with images), his answer to the survey on love, and Je ne vois pas la [femme] cachée dans la forêt, a painting tableau surrounded by photos of sixteen surrealists with their eyes closed, including Magritte himself.",

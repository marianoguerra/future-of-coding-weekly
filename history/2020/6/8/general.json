We already have technology that explicitly reflects other anti-X values, like FOSS reflecting anti-capitalist values, so this feels quite possible.\n\n(NB. with respect to \"design inspired by the present moment\", it's worth being mindful of the lesson here: <https:\/\/medium.com\/design-toast\/black-lives-matter-is-not-a-design-challenge-f6e452ff7821> — there may be Black members of our community who would value weighing-in on this thread, but who are unable to do so.)",

You'll need that for a projectional editor too I guess). To do that, I firstly consider comments as whitespace. In my syntax grammar, all bottom-level constructs (literals) contain no whitespace, but there is a piece of \"required whitespace\" between arguments in an S-expression and a piece of \"optional whitespace\" after the opening and before the closing parenthesis. So an S-Expression contains N child-expressions and N+1 (potentially empty) whitespace segments. I do not parse the comments especially or associate them to other elements, but your whitespace could also be a structure that explicitly stores comments as separate entities.\n\n*EDIT:* in case it's not clear, the structure I use is an AST.",

You'll need that for a projectional editor too I guess). To do that, I firstly consider comments as whitespace. In my syntax grammar, all bottom-level constructs (literals) contain no whitespace, but there is a piece of \"required whitespace\" between arguments in an S-expression and a piece of \"optional whitespace\" after the opening and before the closing parenthesis. So an S-Expression contains N child-expressions and N+1 (potentially empty) whitespace segments. I do not parse the comments especially or associate them to other elements, but your whitespace could also be a structure that explicitly stores comments as separate entities.\n\n"

I've done \"tone it down\" comments (in the form of \"this is drifting off-topic; let me repeat the initial discussion prompt\") here-and-there in other threads. It tends not to work. This thread is a bit different, though, as it's not just off topic. In this case, we have one person saying _I don't see any racism_, surrounded by people saying _I do_. In the current cultural moment, it is entirely not the time to push the _I don't see it, so it doesn't exist_ argument. If you don't know about the pay gaps, the glass ceilings, the double standards, the <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Algorithmic_bias#Racial_and_ethnic_discrimination|algorithmic bias>… please go elsewhere to learn about those things. This thread was meant to be a place for people who are already past the _7 stages of white grief_ (to speak very crassly about something serious — sorry) and are ready to engage on the level of _here are papers about critical race theory_ and start working on _how do we fix this here in our own practice?_\n\nWill came in at a very advanced level, and we haven't managed to meet him at that level. Can we do that? <https:\/\/futureofcoding.slack.com\/archives\/C5T9GPWFL\/p1591617796052000?thread_ts=1591498636.036100&amp;cid=C5T9GPWFL|I tried>, and I'd love to see some others try too.\n\n(And re: representation in countries outside the USA — that's a very interesting consideration, it it does serve as an interesting _counterpoint_ [in the musical sense] to what's happening in the USA right now. But please be aware that some folks might see it as a _counterargument,_ and that might be hurtful or a distraction. The problem in the USA, the problem of interest right now due to the cultural moment, isn't just about, say, the relative percentage of various races employed in tech. It's a far broader and deeper issue. I hope that enough of us are aware of the scope of that issue and are able to think about how to address it. That's the conversation Will set up, and that's the conversation we should be having in this thread. If you'd like to discuss other facets of the intersection of race and tech, I'll meet you in a new thread.)",

There's no such thing in Python, but you can have only free variables on the left that always get bound. Should that also work now, given the unpacking pattern can use `case [\"red\", a]` ?",

To add a criticism to <@U8A5MS6R1>'s list: `Point(x, y)` not only looks like a constructor but isn't, it also interprets arguments in a different way from a constructor. Sure, one would expect Python programmers to ensure that a class' `__init__` and `__match__` are semantically compatible, but I bet we will see many classes whose `__init__` allows more variations than `__match__` . And I also bet that people will try to use `class(**args)` as a pattern and expect `class` to be bound to the class object.",

I think it still had gc and green threads as late as 2012, so at least 6 years to figure out the right combination of features to omit the runtime, becoming recognizably the language that it is today. I wouldn't have paid money for Rust in 2007.\n\nZig is only 5 years old and is surprisingly usable (although I still crash the compiler). I think the timeline for Clojure was similar. But both are much simpler languages, sticking to fairly well understood design spaces. I suspect most foc projects are more like Rust in that they're tackling completely new areas of the design space and will need a lot of shaking out before it's clear whether or not they're going to work out.",

I think it still had gc and green threads as late as 2012, so at least 6 years to figure out the right combination of features to omit the runtime, becoming recognizably the language that it is today. I wouldn't have paid money for Rust in 2007.\n\nZig is only 5 years old and is surprisingly usable (although I still crash the compiler). I think the timeline for Clojure was similar. But both are much simpler languages, sticking to fairly well understood design spaces. I suspect most foc projects are more like Rust in that they're tackling completely new areas of the design space and will need a lot of shaking out before it's clear whether or not they're going to work out."

I think what I’m getting at is — what is a specific _task_ involving this kind of understanding? e.g. a hypothetical task is “I need to understand how many ms elapse from the start of the tick to when my gameplay logic runs”, which requires understanding OoO\/subsystem dependencies, presumably.\n\nI’m being a little pedantic here because understanding how to provide cognitive support has to start with a task. e.g. when evaluating whether to use a bar chart vs. pie chart to display some data, you don’t ask “which is better”, you ask “which is better when a person is trying to find the maximum value in my dataset”.\n\nHere’s a high-level task taxonomy from “Program Comprehension During Software Maintenance and Evolution”. These are a bit vague, but a useful starting point.",

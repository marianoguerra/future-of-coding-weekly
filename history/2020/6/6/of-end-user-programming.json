The greatest products and designers in the history of design, such as Henry Dreyfuss, designed their products without users peering over his shoulder. He for sure tested the heck out of them to ensure ergonomic fit for 95% of the population, but to imagine that his greatest designs were the result of groupthink, focus groups, brainstorming sessions etc.,  is ridiculous. Design is a creative act, not the juggling of already existing things with the help of untrained masses of people who can't possibly understand the myriad tradeoffs and decisions involved in good design. Dreyfuss had a way of minimizing the controls and sculpting things so elegantly and perfectly fitting the human body that they endured for decades longer than competing designs. The best designs are invariably the work of a single person, or a single mind. Dieter Rams did great work, and of course the greatest designer in the history of the world mentioned above. Ferd.

The automotive world has been blessed with many great designers.\n\nSome products are so well designed that it is almost impossible to improve them. The Swiss Army knife for example has barely changed in 100 years simply because improvement is hard when you are near the optimal point.\n\nI find the user tailorable aspects of Adobe's product line for example to be an example of poor design. You get palette-itis, and although customizable you shouldn't need to shuffle all the palettes around, the system should do it automatically to save the effort.

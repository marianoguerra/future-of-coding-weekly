I'm a fan of libraries that support reactive updates, such as Assisticant, KnockoutJS, MobX, Vue.js and SwiftUI, but I don't know of one that contains the algorithm I want. I'll explain the problem by example. Suppose you have:\n\n1. an \"observable\" list of a million items, and you insert or remove an item somewhere in the list\n2. a filtered list based on the million items showing perhaps a thousand of the items\n3. a projection of the filtered list (map\/select)\nSo, when you insert or remove the item, the library should efficiently (and automatically!) propagate the change through the filtered list to the projected list. If the new or removed item is filtered out anyway, propagation should stop so the projected list is not notified of a change. Ideally, change notifications should be deferred in some way so that if several changes are made to the same list item in rapid succession, the derived items (2 and 3) would only be notified once.",

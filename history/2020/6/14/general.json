In one sense, you’re right that Go can’t directly call the OS because it only has access to thunks and data that the VM owner puts in its environment, but on the other hand, the OS is accessed in JavaScript entirely through the global object so the “opening” doesn’t need to be very wide at all for access to the OS to be about even in JS and wasm in practice.\n\nThere must be synchronization overhead if the wasm executes in another thread (I didn’t know it did, that’s good to know!), but I haven’t noticed it. Wasm must be implemented in a more efficient way than Web Workers, because worker isolation is so strict that you can’t call one synchronously from, say, an event handler that needs to finish in one JS event loop tick, but you can call wasm in an event handler.\n\nThe people working on WASI are trying to create a shim that encompasses every functionality that you’d typically get from an OS, so that every compiler can just target that one shim instead of inventing a new one for their language. That’ll provide some of the language-independence you’re talking about, especially since if it becomes standard, browsers can implement DOM access directly instead of relying on memory sharing with JS.\n\nIf you’re curious, the Go shim is here, just a few hundred lines: <https:\/\/github.com\/golang\/go\/blob\/master\/misc\/wasm\/wasm_exec.js|https:\/\/github.com\/golang\/go\/blob\/master\/misc\/wasm\/wasm_exec.js> The system calls it exports to wasm binaries are in importObject (syscall\/js.valueGet, syscall\/js.valueSet, etc).",

In one sense, you’re right that Go can’t directly call the OS because it only has access to thunks and data that the VM owner puts in its environment, but on the other hand, the OS is accessed in JavaScript entirely through the global object so the “opening” doesn’t need to be very wide at all for access to the OS to be about even in JS and wasm in practice.\n\nThere must be synchronization overhead if the wasm executes in another thread (I didn’t know it did, that’s good to know!), but I haven’t noticed it. Wasm must be implemented in a more efficient way than Web Workers, because worker isolation is so strict that you can’t call one synchronously from, say, an event handler that needs to finish in one JS event loop tick, but you can call wasm in an event handler.\n\nThe people working on WASI are trying to create a shim that encompasses every functionality that you’d typically get from an OS, so that every compiler can just target that one shim instead of inventing a new one for their language. That’ll provide some of the language-independence you’re talking about, especially since if it becomes standard, browsers can implement DOM access directly instead of relying on memory sharing with JS.\n\nIf you’re curious, the Go shim is here, just a few hundred lines: "

The idea is to learn what coding is about, not  jump start your training to be a software engineer. (Besides, if FoC is successful, will we still be printing \"hello world\" to the console as our first program :wink:?)\n\nImagine if you are 5-10 years old (or even an adult) and learning what movie making is about as an absolute beginner. Would you like to start out doing all the gruntwork and assembling real equipment? Working hard until you get perfect lighting and audio (aka \"fix all syntax errors\")? Or would you rather get the big picture and some hands on activities with the processes and purpose? E.g storyboards (not pro quality), shooting with phone cameras, lighting, sound with hobby equipement, basic editing etc. You'd want to eliminate\/reduce the hard gruntwork, keep it simple and use everyday gear. The everyday gear is stuff people already can mostly manipulate - mouse pointers, blocks, drop downs, occasional text, etc.",

They know computers are the most magical objects in existence. When a learn to code tool tries to make computing seem mundane, it rings false. Computing is the closest thing we as a species has to magic, and I wish learning environments did a better job of capturing that sense of wonder I got writing a simple for loop."

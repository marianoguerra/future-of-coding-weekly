        "text": "A coroutine is a lightweight cooperative thread. An example use might be waiting on asynchronous operations (like i\/o) without loosing the state you’ve built up in your call stack - as you’d end up having to construct an even more complex (and likely inscrutable) state machine otherwise. So when you make your call to wait on an i\/o operation, behind the scenes it sets aside your current stack and continues some other coroutine (or returns to the event loop). When the i\/o operation event occurs, that callback resumes (switches to) the previously paused coroutine’s stack. In this way, you can writing asynchronous code as if it were synchronous, while still being aware of where those points are via things like naming conventions on methods that may pause the coroutine. You can also yield coroutines at safe points so they can do long running computations with stacks.",

An example use might be waiting on asynchronous operations (like i\/o) without loosing the state you’ve built up in your call stack - as you’d end up having to construct an even more complex (and likely inscrutable) state machine otherwise. So when you make your call to wait on an i\/o operation, behind the scenes it sets aside your current stack and continues some other coroutine (or returns to the event loop). When the i\/o operation event occurs, that callback resumes (switches to) the previously paused coroutine’s stack. In this way, you can writing asynchronous code as if it were synchronous, while still being aware of where those points are via things like naming conventions on methods that may pause the coroutine. You can also yield coroutines at safe points so they can do long running computations with stacks."

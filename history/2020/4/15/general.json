What I share in common with your hypothetical interlocutors is the unspoken question, \"how could this _possibly_ be made to work?\"\n\nIn <https:\/\/futureofcoding.slack.com\/archives\/C5T9GPWFL\/p1586869277389100?thread_ts=1584718837.435500&amp;cid=C5T9GPWFL> you suggested that you're trying to separate goals from solutions and focus on the former. That's reasonable as a goal for this particular page. (It's also why I find this page unsatisfying.) But it also seems reasonable for it to trigger conversations about the how. That doesn't feel like \"missing the point\". Isn't that sort of conversation what this page is designed to engender?\n\nPerhaps it will help to triangulate by bringing up my mission: <http:\/\/akkartik.name\/about>. Not to brag, but we're attacking highly overlapping if not isomorphic problems. By definition I should have addressed any shortcomings I bring up here. It stays high-level, focuses on goals, but also indicates the sorts of trade-offs I'm willing to make. I'd love to receive similar criticism from you about what it's lacking. I should probably update it after my recent efforts writing my paper :sweat_smile: It's quite possible there's a cultural chasm here from me spending too much time on HN. I'd love to understand it better.\n\nPerhaps it would help to drill down into which comments you consider to be missing the point. It might require a private conversation, but it might help make this conversation more concrete. Here, I'll start by summarizing how I view the top-level comments:\n\n<https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=22858254>: neutral sentiment, acknowledges you're stating an unpopular opinion, responds with another. Seems useful for generating ideas, and -- reading between the lines -- sympathetic.\n\n<https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=22859409>: negative sentiment. I would steelman it (\"what could this be true of?\") as asking a) do you propose limits to extensibility, and b) how do you imagine the system as a whole self-regulating in response to bad changes? That seems useful, even if it's not phrased constructively.\n\n<https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=22862292>: not useful, as <@UDQBTJ211> already pointed out.\n\n<https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=22859613>: positive sentiment. Points out the future is already here, maybe just not evenly distributed.\n\n<https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=22874983>: negative sentiment, but suggests that your problem statement needs focus. Seems like useful feedback.\n\n<https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=22858315>: neutral sentiment, draws a connection with another story on the frontpage to highlight a trade-off. Super useful, to my mind. Engendered a response (<https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=22858888>) from someone seemingly ripe to join the movement.\n\n<https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=22858897>: neutral sentiment, brings up Plan 9 as prior art. My favorite sub-thread, if my actions are any guide. (Plan 9 isn't a major obsession of mine.)\n\n<https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=22864602>: negative sentiment, airs a conservation of complexity argument that might be worth addressing head-on. Maybe you need a FAQ?\n\nOther people making positive noises in startlingly diverse choices of words:\n* <https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=22862660>\n* <https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=22859957>\n* <https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=22862143>\n* <https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=22872606> (supporting the right to make a mess)\n\n<https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=22859278>: Someone being politely skeptical _by using Rails as an example_. So they're missing the point a bit, thinking about how opinionated you should be _after you have achieved malleability_. Still kinda interesting to me.\n\nThis is just the top-level comments, but at a glance the responses in the major sub-trees seem to mostly be ping-pong rebuttals. So to first approximation half the comments are supportive of the endeavor!\n\nOverall, there's a refreshing lack of \"startup mindset\" in this thread, particularly if -- like me -- you go in expecting 90% of everything to be crap. Nobody's asking you how you make money, or to to define a market, or to tweak the website. Great example of my thesis that HN is really 2 or 3 mostly-decoupled communities.",

Nobody's asking you how you make money, or to to define a market, or to tweak the website. Great example of my thesis that HN is really 2 or 3 mostly-decoupled communities."

Software must be as easy to change as it is to use it.\n\nI support making software harder to use if it will get us to this goal faster. Everybody eat your vegetables.\n\n&gt; 2. All layers, from the user interface through functionality to the data within, must support arbitrary recombination and reuse in new environments.\n\nThe easiest way to support this is by letting users edit source code. Recombination and reuse don't have to happen from behind some pane of glass. <http:\/\/www.bldgblog.com\/2010\/01\/nakatomi-space|Allow your users to be like John McClane from the \"Die Hard\" movies, punching through walls and jumping through elevator shafts.> Focus on giving them maps and safety nets.\n\n&gt; 3. Tools should strive to be easy to begin working with but still have lots of open-ended potential.\n\nThe most natural place to begin working with a tool is using it. Treat your existing users as potential hackers at the start of a funnel with a steep drop-off. Some of them will recombine what you give them, but you don't know who. How do _you_ maintain motivation to continue supporting them under these conditions?\n\n&gt; 4. Retain ownership and control.\n\nExisting extension systems like browsers and Emacs already do this? By the time somebody is extending your system they tend to know enough to exercise ownership. Maybe we just need to grow this set of people?\n\n&gt; 5. Freely shareable.\n\nAgain, it's unclear what systems are in the author's mind that are extensible but not shareable.\n\n&gt; 6. Modifying in the context of use.\n\nThis seems really hard. Should it be a high priority? I recommend going from `(disempowered, beautiful)` to `(empowered, ugly)` first, trading off one attribute (candy) for another (eat your vegetables) to strengthen fundamentals. Once you lay the ground work, then you can try to perform the energetic heavy lift to `(empowered, beautiful)`.\n\n&gt; 7. Thoughtfully crafted.\n\nThis. This is the meat. Everything else feels like fluff, either really obvious or pie-in-the-sky hard. Don't make me wade through it to get here. That'll also give you more space to elaborate. How do we 'refine' our tools? Is this a matter of UX? Superficial reworking? Deeper surgery? Throwing everything out and starting over? A new methodology? A new social structure?\n\nOverall, I think my disagreements mostly stem from an overwhelming sense of urgency. You're over-constraining your solution space by shooting simultaneously for useful social properties (empowerment) and useful individual aesthetic properties (Bret Victor-esque WYSIWYG context of use). We're far enough behind here that maybe we should aim lower. It doesn't convey the appropriate urgency to say that \"software is trapped in silos\". No, the problem is that we find ourselves in a world where everybody uses software, and software can do anything, and nobody knows what their software is doing. Instructions from too many masters are fractally intertwined. This can't end well. We need to get off this train as quickly as possible.\n\nSigned,  \n<http:\/\/akkartik.name\/about|Kartik Agaram>",

        "text": "Are there any languages with explicit focus (and philosophy) around intermediary steps between ideas and working code? Modern programming languages feel like I must, in part, produce completed structures of code, rather than brainstorming and exploring. Programming inevitably alternates the code from working to not working to working to not working, etc, and we would benefit from languages that were more explicit about facilitating the ‘not working’ states. From my rough intuition, the ‘not working’ states of code outweigh ‘working’ state in terms of time and importance (e.g. compiler for code that is exploratory but does not work).\n\nREPL, for a very simple idea, is praised so much (and so widely used) perhaps for this reason — it facilitates intermediate steps. This would be a rough parallel to how Bret Victor mentions that “ideas are important” to him. I looked at <https:\/\/medium.com\/bits-and-behavior\/four-years-of-studying-exploratory-programming-4656586b1d3b|Exploratory Programming>, but it doesn’t seem to capture exactly what I want (i.e. goes a bit too shallow).\n\nEDIT: Also relevant, <http:\/\/tomasp.net\/histogram\/|Histogram> and <https:\/\/youtu.be\/X36ye-1x_HQ?t=1273|Type-driven Development>",

Modern programming languages feel like I must, in part, produce completed structures of code, rather than brainstorming and exploring. Programming inevitably alternates the code from working to not working to working to not working, etc, and we would benefit from languages that were more explicit about facilitating the ‘not working’ states. From my rough intuition, the ‘not working’ states of code outweigh ‘working’ state in terms of time and importance (e.g. compiler for code that is exploratory but does not work).\n\nREPL, for a very simple idea, is praised so much (and so widely used) perhaps for this reason — it facilitates intermediate steps. This would be a rough parallel to how Bret Victor mentions that “ideas are important” to him. I looked at "

My computer can hold multiple incompatible forks without them mutually annihilating. Why can't people's belief systems?\n\nWhen was the last time we saw a maintainer _thank_ someone for creating a fork? Forks should be treated more like Andon Cords (<https:\/\/itrevolution.com\/kata>). Creating them is an act of bravery, and even if you don't agree with the reasons they are a valuable source of feedback. These are events to be celebrated and encouraged.",

For example, a machine that could solve the halting problem would be a hypercomputer; so too would one that can correctly evaluate every statement in Peano arithmetic.\nThe Church–Turing thesis states that any \"computable\" function that can be computed by a mathematician with a pen and paper using a finite set of simple algorithms, can be computed by a Turing machine. Hypercomputers compute functions that a Turing machine cannot and which are, hence, not computable in the Church–Turing sense.\nTechnically, the output of a random Turing machine is uncomputable; however, most hypercomputing literature focuses instead on the computation of useful, rather than random, uncomputable functions.",

                "text": "A Malament–Hogarth (M-H) spacetime, named after David B. Malament and Mark Hogarth, is a relativistic spacetime that possesses the following property: there exists a worldline \n  \n    \n      \n        λ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda }\n   and an event p such that all events along \n  \n    \n      \n        λ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda }\n   are a finite interval in the past of p, but the proper time along \n  \n    \n      \n        λ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda }\n   is infinite. The event p is known as an M-H event. The significance of M-H spacetimes is that they allow for the implementation of certain non-Turing computable tasks (hypercomputation). The idea is for an observer at some event in p's past to set a computer (Turing machine) to work on some task and then have the Turing machine travel on \n  \n    \n      \n        λ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda }\n  , computing for all eternity. Since \n  \n    \n      \n        λ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda }\n   lies in p's past, the Turing machine can signal (a solution) to p at any stage of this never-ending task. Meanwhile, the observer takes a quick trip (finite proper time) through spacetime to p, to pick up the solution. The set-up can be used to decide the halting problem, which is known to be undecidable by an ordinary Turing machine. All the observer needs to do is to prime the Turing machine to signal to p if and only if the Turing machine halts.\nThe Kerr metric, which describes empty spacetime around a rotating black hole, possesses these features: a computer can orbit the black hole indefinitely, while an observer falling into the black hole experiences an M-H event as they cross the inner event horizon. (This, however, neglects the effects of black hole evaporation.)",

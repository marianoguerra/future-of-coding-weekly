Certainly, for the graphical parts of coding, and that is a lot of the process, it will be much easier than typing. The key advantage of graphical interfaces is that you can constrain the visibility and presentation of options so that it is nearly impossible to have an invalid state. Textual coding has lots of tiny typographical errors, and that frustrates people. As i progress on this process of graphicalization i will find out how far you can actually take a language that is very Pythonic  into this space. The output of the IDE is the canonical text form of the language, which will allow programs last a lot longer. Different IDE's will spring up over time, and the internal form of a document from an IDE is highly IDE specific. Just for \"diff\" reasons you need a text form that can be compared and updated. So a graphical system that stores into text format is a very sound idea. I know that the Luna people are doing a similar thing. Anyway please let me know if the video is tolerable. It seems a little fuzzy; i uploaded it at 720p but maybe not enough pixels.\n\nThe IDE for Beads is written in itself, and shows very good compactness as it is only 15k words (approx 4000 lines) so far.",

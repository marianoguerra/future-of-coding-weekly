To be honest, it's very early days for these malleability ideas, so it seems natural. I am sure many people (esp. on HN) might not be interested when there's no startup to back or quick solution to try out today, and that's okay. For now, I'm mainly hoping to reach anyone interested in experimenting with these ideas or wanting to learn more about those who are doing so.\n\nAt the same time, there was some good discussion of finer details in a few of the sub-threads, and I hope it has at least planted a seed for people to think about the ideas over time. Even if people disagree or don't see the point in it today, hopefully they are at least now aware that some people do, and may be more open to such ideas down the road.\n\nSince the HN post appeared, a lot of new people have gotten in touch to share their excitement for these ideas, so overall I'd say the HN post was a positive step even if there are many confused people in the comments. Thanks to everyone here who may have waded in the HN comments with their own perspective. :smile:",

To be honest, it's very early days for these malleability ideas, so it seems natural. I am sure many people (esp. on HN) might not be interested when there's no startup to back or quick solution to try out today, and that's okay. For now, I'm mainly hoping to reach anyone interested in experimenting with these ideas or wanting to learn more about those who are doing so.\n\nAt the same time, there was some good discussion of finer details in a few of the sub-threads, and I hope it has at least planted a seed for people to think about the ideas over time. Even if people disagree or don't see the point in it today, hopefully they are at least now aware that some people do, and may be more open to such ideas down the road.\n\nSince the HN post appeared, a lot of new people have gotten in touch to share their excitement for these ideas, so overall I'd say the HN post was a positive step even if there are many confused people in the comments. Thanks to everyone here who may have waded in the HN comments with their own perspective. "

Replace this by a network of modular subsystems with reasonably stable APIs, and you can have malleability for the whole system and for each subsystem.

        "text": "I came across a PICO-8 tutorial today. While I was aware of the platform, I didn’t know much about it. What I found most interesting is that the limitations, in particular the restriction to 8192 “tokens” that your Lua source code can maximally have, made the person conducting the tutorial optimize the code several times to reduce the number of tokens used. He achieved that mostly through basic refactoring, often using the DRY principle, but also sometimes making the code a little more concise\/clever\/obscure.\n\nThis (artificial) limitation adds a dynamic to development for PICO-8 that I find fascinating. It adds a forcing function for “keeping code lean” which I haven’t seen like this anywhere else. The only other similar thing I can think of is the 140\/280 character limit on Twitter. Or maybe demoscene contest categories that limit the code and\/or binary sizes to a certain amount of bytes.\n\nDo you know of any other programming environments or IDEs that use soft metrics or hard limits or any other tricks to introduce an awareness for wastefulness to programming?\nAnd how do you feel about that as a means to improve code quality?",

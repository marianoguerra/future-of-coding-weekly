        "text": "The Iron Man interfaces are wonderfully entertaining pieces of graphic art. There are just a few people in hollywood who know how to make those things. They are mixture of 3D and 2D animations, always using glowing lines and very few colors so it looks terrific. But as a user interface it would be horrible because all the buttons look alike, and the font sizes are microscopic. So although they are sexy from a distance, if you had one in front of you, it would be confusing, hard to use. A lot of music software is enraptured with sub-6pt fonts, and microscopic icons. So i would be wary of chasing Hollywood's ideas.  Remember Star Trek next generation, with their buttonless screens that would be sure to create carpal tunnel syndrome in record time? A lot of the futuristic stuff is unergonomic, and possibly harmful to the human body, and presumes a magical artificial intelligence that just graduated from CalArts and spent 1000 hours making a screen that appears in the movie for 2 minutes. A 100 million motion picture is a time compression device, where 50,000 man hours go into making something that lasts 2, so a 25,000 : 1 ratio there. By all means see what you can come up with, but don't hold yourself to unattainable graphic standards that are the work of genius graphic designers who are at the top of a very specialized field (i.e. fake UI's for futuristic films). Hollywood has a long history of faking the future; Irwin Allen was a famous TV producer who loved banks of flashing lights and nutty rubber monsters. I think you are better off studying from the great masters of the Renaissance, who used proportions to draw everything, and also the great book \"Designing for people\" by Henry Dreyfuss, the greatest industrial designer in the history of the world. Everyone who does any design work should know that man's output because he was so great. He didn't do computer interfaces, but he had a systematic way of attacking every problem that resulted in an optimal final design. It is his methodology that is still useful today.",

I haven't used all the products below, but all of them have happy users:\n• For wrangling rectangles of data: Pandas in Python, dplyr in R (my personal favorite)  and SQL, and GUI tools like Alteryx and Trifacta.\n• For data visualization: Javascript\/R\/Python all have increasingly powerful and easy-ish to use options for viz, there are chart chooser tools like DataWrapper and Flourish, and GUI tools with sophisticated grammars of graphics like Tableau.\n",

In other words, you can easily make changes to a function that create arbitrarily-difficult-to-debug holes for yourself. I rely on the people using layers to use them tastefully.\n\nI think this is an irreducible trade-off. If you want extending functions to always be nice and safe, you'll be restricted in the number of places the safe mechanism is available to you.\n\nIn my current project I instead focus on catching any possible breakage in the project using some combination of tests, types and correct-by-construction design. This is the _top_ priority, and I give up as much as possible while preserving it. Now others can modify functions all they want, safe in the knowledge that _something_ will complain if they break something when forking a function.",

In other words, you can easily make changes to a function that create arbitrarily-difficult-to-debug holes for yourself.

If you want extending functions to always be nice and safe, you'll be restricted in the number of places the safe mechanism is available to you.\n\nIn my current project I instead focus on catching any possible breakage in the project using some combination of tests, types and correct-by-construction design.

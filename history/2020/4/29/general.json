Simultaneously, they are often too rigid.  You discover you want two things to lineup cross-hierarchy, and your kind of out of luck.  What to do then?  Give feedback.  Explain why a thing ends up the way it does.  Then make it easy to give examples of what you want, which may be realized in more than one way.\n\nBrowsers have been getting better with explaining CSS, but not without eliminating rage inducing headaches.  For instance, it might be hard to select a border in order to determine where it is coming from.",

You don't know who is in charge: the container or the content.  Simultaneously, they are often too rigid.  You discover you want two things to lineup cross-hierarchy, and your kind of out of luck.  What to do then?  Give feedback.  Explain why a thing ends up the way it does.  Then make it easy to give examples of what you want, which may be realized in more than one way.\n\nBrowsers have been getting better with explaining CSS, but not without eliminating rage inducing headaches.  For instance, it might be hard to select a border in order to determine where it is coming from."

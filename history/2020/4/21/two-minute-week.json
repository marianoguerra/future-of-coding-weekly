                "text": "Hey everyone. Recently I've read this article and really liked some plain ideas that seem to be unnoticed.  \n<https:\/\/programmingmadecomplicated.wordpress.com\/2017\/08\/12\/there-is-only-one-os-and-its-been-obsolete-for-decades\/|https:\/\/programmingmadecomplicated.wordpress.com\/2017\/08\/12\/there-is-only-one-os-and-its-been-obsolete-for-decades\/>\n\n&gt; Why do so many languages have a function called print instead of write or something else? They were influenced by C. Ever wonder why C called it so? Now you know. It literally printed ink onto paper.  \n&gt; ...  \n&gt; this is still the only way we can get anything done in the world of programming! Typing textual orders into a “terminal” or “console” application—nothing more than an emulator for the teletype!\n\nSo I got this feeling that there must be an API that would replace text pipes that we enjoy today in Unix world. Maybe this API is not discovered yet, but it definitely will be discovered sooner or later (just like lisp was discovered). What it should look like then?\n\n&gt; Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.\n\nCurrently I think about it on the level of the API, not on a transport level. I don't know will it use TCP or UDP sockets, or Unix pipes, or how it gonna be encoded, it unrelated for now.\n\nHere are my thoughts:\n\n1. Very simple API that is easy to implement on many platforms without mistakes.\n2. Convenient for providing access to complicated nested data between different programs.\n3. Convenient for inspecting remote object (say, interface for debugging).\n4. Don't demand any prerequisites for reading, filtering or transmitting. No prerequisite dependencies should be required: no grammar or types (unlike Protobuf or ASN.1).\n5. Suitable for delivering structured logs and events.\n\nSome related ideas to think about: <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1O8PwkXfDJg|https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1O8PwkXfDJg>  \nGraphQL also reminds something like that, but looks too complicated. Must be simpler.\n\nI've implemented something similar when I was working on complicated frontend code. A big tree of objects, to different parts of which you may subscribe and receive diffs. These diffs are accepted on other side and might be applied to get fresh information that we're interested in.\n\nThis idea of sending diffs for a tree which may be saved and applied at any moment in timeline is really beautiful. You got updates for your data and also the history of changes. It Very similar to VCS textual diffs, but for trees (AST ?).\n\n```\ndiff: { resource1: { status: started, startedAt: 1 } }\ndiff: { resource1: { status: stopped, stoppedAt: 2 } }\n----------\ntree: { resource1: { status: stopped, startedAt: 1, stoppedAt: 2 } }\n\n```\n\nSame trees might be used to deliver changes in AST during code editing.\n\nYet this API certainly gonna be used for delivering logs and events. Providing keys for each event is tiresome and requires to maintain state. So it must provide not only nested trees, but also sequences of objects.\n\n```\nseq: {event: \"app start\", at: 1}\nseq: {event: \"function-call start\", at: 2, funcName: \"foobar\", args: [1, 2]}\nseq: {event: \"app stop\", at: 5}\n\n```\n\nThen it came to me that this way we can integrate existing pipe-based outputs as sequences of binaries that are split by new line or by arbitrary size (say, size of the buffer).\n\nOne of the painful things when you deal with pipes is that everything is one-channel sequential. If you want to provide several kinds of data then you have to make interleaving, or create additional pipe.\n\nSo it came just natural that this API should be able to provide several channels of data, that allow you to filter out data you don't need. In these terms normal unix application provides two output channels: stdout and stderr. In this API you would be able to have many of them.\n\nHere are some questions to consider: should channels have type (tree or sequence)? Should we think about trees as sequence of diff objects, therefore just sequence? Or maybe allow every channel have sequence and tree under same name? This looks somewhat convenient with HTTP requests: having body as a sequence and headers and meta info as a tree.\n\nI can easily see this API being used for everyday problems with that sed, awk, grep used to solve. This API will naturally have some kind of shell environment (language?), position which held by bash in today world. An IDE where you observe flowing data, just like how you observe in now in DevTools in Chrome.\n\nBut that's really complicated issue, and I would love to hear feedback about written above first.",

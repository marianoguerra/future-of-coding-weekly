                "text": "In computer science and operations research, the ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) is a probabilistic technique for solving computational problems which can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs. Artificial Ants stand for multi-agent methods inspired by the behavior of real ants. \nThe pheromone-based communication of biological ants is often the predominant paradigm used.   Combinations of Artificial Ants and local search algorithms have become a method of choice for numerous optimization tasks involving some sort of graph, e.g., vehicle routing and internet routing. The burgeoning activity in this field has led to conferences dedicated solely to Artificial Ants, and to numerous commercial applications by specialized companies such as AntOptima.\nAs an example, Ant colony optimization  is a class of optimization algorithms modeled on the actions of an ant colony.  Artificial 'ants' (e.g. simulation agents) locate optimal solutions by moving through a parameter space representing all possible solutions.  Real ants lay down pheromones directing each other to resources while exploring their environment.  The simulated 'ants' similarly record their positions and the quality of their solutions, so that in later simulation iterations more ants locate better solutions.  One variation on this approach is the bees algorithm, which is more analogous to the foraging patterns of the honey bee, another social insect.\nThis algorithm is a member of the ant colony algorithms family, in swarm intelligence methods, and it constitutes some metaheuristic optimizations. Initially proposed by Marco Dorigo in 1992 in his PhD thesis, the first algorithm was aiming to search for an optimal path in a graph, based on the behavior of ants seeking a path between their colony and a source of food. The original idea has since diversified to solve a wider class of numerical problems, and as a result, several problems have emerged, drawing on various aspects of the behavior of ants. From a broader perspective, ACO performs a model-based search and shares some similarities with estimation of distribution algorithms.",

                "text": "Swarm intelligence (SI) is the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems, natural or artificial. The concept is employed in work on artificial intelligence. The expression was introduced by Gerardo Beni and Jing Wang in 1989, in the context of cellular robotic <http:\/\/systems.SI|systems.SI> systems consist typically of a population of simple agents or boids interacting locally with one another and with their environment. The inspiration often comes from nature, especially biological systems. The agents follow very simple rules, and although there is no centralized control structure dictating how individual agents should behave, local, and to a certain degree random, interactions between such agents lead to the emergence of \"intelligent\" global behavior, unknown to the individual agents. Examples of swarm intelligence in natural systems include ant colonies, bird flocking, hawks hunting, animal herding, bacterial growth, fish schooling and microbial intelligence.\nThe application of swarm principles to robots is called swarm robotics, while 'swarm intelligence' refers to the more general set of algorithms. 'Swarm prediction' has been used in the context of forecasting problems. Similar approaches to those proposed for swarm robotics are considered for genetically modified organisms in synthetic collective intelligence.",

So, taking a disclaimer here that the structure of ideas on this might be incoherent as I don't have enough clarity as I didn't go deep enough into the thick of these things and then zoom out to get the birds view picture. Most of the stuff that I list here are the ones that I have either bookmarked or found to be interesting during my spelunking. But I emphasis that I haven't personally chased down to comprehend their proper form, function and\/or how they relate with each other.\n\nFirst up there seems to be a wikipedia article here: <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Model_of_computation> which has some interesting models and a related section with further ones.\n\nBut using the structure you have provided as a baseline, one thing missing there is rewriting ideas used by Post \/ Semi-Thue systems (which I think comes under the abstract rewriting systems category in Wiki's classification).\n\nHere are some links:\n1\/ <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Post_canonical_system>\n2\/ <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Semi-Thue_system>\n3\/ This looks like a good paper to read about this: <https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/pdf\/82345385.pdf>\n\nNext up is the idea of formalizing what computation is. Most of my understanding comes from this well written blogpost by Ron Pressler: <https:\/\/pron.github.io\/posts\/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-computation>\nIf you are academically inclined and willing to dig down, there is some deeply funny stuff happening with Chomsky hierarchy of formal grammars, automata, data structures (chain, tree, lattice, graphs), algorithms and their complexity classes. There are some non-trivial highly regular deep structure there.\n\nThere are these books if you want to chase this rabbit holes:\n1\/ Computation: Finite and Infinite Models — <https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/326791.Computation>\n2\/ Understanding Computation: <https:\/\/computationbook.com\/>\n3\/ Nature of Computation: <http:\/\/nature-of-computation.org\/>\n4\/ Computability and Complexity: <http:\/\/hjemmesider.diku.dk\/~neil\/comp2book2007\/book-whole.pdf>\n5\/ Models of Computation: <https:\/\/cs.brown.edu\/people\/jsavage\/book\/pdfs\/ModelsOfComputation.pdf>\n6\/ Models of Computation and Formal Languages: <https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Models-Computation-Formal-Languages-R-Gregory\/dp\/019510983X\/>\n\nOne thing (I could be wrong here) about the above books I think is that they operate under the mainstream consensus of agreeing that Church-Turing Thesis formalizes what computation is. Though Alan Turing and Church's hypothesis is said to have given a bounded form to the mechanism of computation, there are ideas like that of Robert Rosen proposing that Church Turing Thesis is wrong and can't possibly stand as a model for all computation physically realizable. There is something called epistemic cut and other ideas which I haven't been able to unbundle yet.\n\nHere are some relevant reading materials if these rabbit holes intrigue you:\nRobert Rosen's paper: <https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007\/BF02477996.pdf>\nIs Church-Turing thesis true? <https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/BF00976283>\nSurvey on these ideas: <https:\/\/users.dcc.uchile.cl\/~cgutierr\/papers\/computabilityLife.pdf>\nEpistemic cut: <https:\/\/www.edge.org\/response-detail\/27049>\n\nSignificant idea about Pattee’s work seems to be the interplay of duals like adjoints in Category Theory (I am punching above my weight class here):\n&gt; _\"There are two realities to this thing. Just like light is a wave and a particle at the same time. Information and construction, structure and function, are irreducible properties of the same physical object that exist in different layers with different protocols.\"_",

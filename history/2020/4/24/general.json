                "text": "Parrot is a register-based process virtual machine designed to run dynamic languages efficiently. It is possible to compile Parrot assembly language and Parrot intermediate representation (PIR, an intermediate language) to Parrot bytecode and execute it. Parrot is free and open source software.Parrot was started by the Perl community and is developed with help from the open source and free software communities. As a result, it is focused on license compatibility with Perl (Artistic License 2.0), platform compatibility across a broad array of systems, processor architecture compatibility across most modern processors, speed of execution, small size (around 700k depending on platform), and the flexibility to handle the varying demands made by Raku and other modern dynamic languages.\nVersion 1.0, with a stable Application programming interface (API) for development, was released on March 17, 2009. The current version is release 8.1.0 \"Andean Parakeet\"",

This field has since grown into the international “<https:\/\/toplap.org\/|TOPLAP>” community, with <https:\/\/toplap.org\/nodes\/|dozens of local nodes> and offshoots such as <http:\/\/algorave.com\/|Algorave> algorithmic dance music events, with events taking place in over a hundred cities with <https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/music\/2017\/nov\/30\/is-algorave-the-future-of-dance-music-sheffield-algomech-festival|growing> <https:\/\/cdm.link\/2018\/05\/inside-the-livecoding-algorave-movement-and-what-it-says-about-music\/|media> <https:\/\/mixmag.net\/feature\/algorave\/4|interest>.\n\nLive coders have worked collectively to make their technology and culture accessible, with <https:\/\/github.com\/toplap\/awesome-livecoding#languages|almost all systems shared as free\/open source software>, and attempts to instill <https:\/\/github.com\/Algorave\/guidelines|inclusivity, diversity> and <https:\/\/github.com\/Algorave\/algoraveconduct|safety> across organisations and lineups. On this foundation, <https:\/\/iclc.toplap.org\/|current research> in the field is increasingly looking outward, beyond now well-established practices such as <https:\/\/algorave.com\/|algorave>, livecode <https:\/\/networkmusicfestival.org\/|network music> and <http:\/\/www.ludions.com\/texts\/2007a\/|slow coding>. This includes new interfaces based on old practices including the <https:\/\/github.com\/jarmitage\/Stenophone\/|Stenophone> made from a court transcription device, a <https:\/\/penelope.hypotheses.org\/1780|live-codable loom> based on ancient weaving technology, and experiments in punk genres such as riot grrrl remixed with live codeable machine listening tools.\n\nThis workshop aims to bring together current thinking on how live coding techniques can be combined with other algorithmic practices, and augmented and hybridised with gestural and physical interfaces. A feature of this research is humility, as researchers realise that relatively young computer science innovations have everything to learn from physical interface designs, which have developed through practice over hundreds and perhaps thousands of years. This online workshop explores these themes through discussion and exploration of interfaces and practices.\n\nThis is a call for proposals for short demos, talks and other interventions exploring hybrid live coding interfaces in performance and craft.

A feature of this research is humility, as researchers realise that relatively young computer science innovations have everything to learn from physical interface designs, which have developed through practice over hundreds and perhaps thousands of years. This online workshop explores these themes through discussion and exploration of interfaces and practices.\n\nThis is a call for proposals for short demos, talks and other interventions exploring hybrid live coding interfaces in performance and craft.

Personally, I think simplicity is only part of the equation. What we really want to give the user is _power_, which I define as:\n&gt; \n&gt; `power = breadth × ease ÷ complexity`\n&gt; \n&gt; None of these are precise numeric measures. I’m using math as analogy here, not actual quantification.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Breadth* is the range of different things the language lets you express. C has a lot of breadth—it’s been used for everything from operating systems to user applications to games. Domain-specific languages like AppleScript and Matlab have less breadth.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Ease* is how little effort it takes to make the language do what you want. “Usability” might be another term, though it carries more baggage than I want to bring in. “Higher-level” languages tend to have more ease than lower-level ones. Most languages have a “grain” to them where some things feel easier to express than others.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Complexity* is how big the language is (and its runtime, core libraries, tools, ecosystem, etc.). People talk about how many pages are in a language’s spec, or how many keywords it has. It’s how much the user has to load into their wetware before they can be productive in the system. It is the antonym of simplicity.\n&gt; \n&gt; Reducing complexity _does_ increase power. The smaller the denominator, the larger the resulting value, so our intuition that simplicity is good is valid. However, when reducing complexity, we must take care not to sacrifice breadth or ease in the process, or the total power may go down. Java would be a strictly _simpler_ language if it removed strings, but it probably wouldn’t handle text manipulation tasks well, nor would it be as easy to get things done.\n&gt; \n&gt; The art, then is finding _accidental_ complexity that can be omitted. Language features and interactions that don’t carry their weight by increasing the breadth or ease of using the language.",

Remember, a real engineer doesn't want just a religion about how to solve a problem, like _object-oriented_, or _functional_, or _imperative_, or _logic programming_. This piece of the problem wants to be a functional program. This piece of the program wants to be imperative. This piece wants to be object-oriented. And guess what, this piece wants to be logic-based. And they all want to work together usefully. And that's because of the way the problem is structured, whatever it is. And I don't wanna think that there's any correct answer to any of those questions. It would be awful bad writing a device driver in a functional language. It would be awful bad writing anything like a symbolic manipulator in a thing with complicated syntax. It's awful bad to write a numerical program in anything but Fortran.\" —Gerald Sussman <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=O3tVctB_VSU>",

And guess what, this piece wants to be logic-based. And they all want to work together usefully. And that's because of the way the problem is structured, whatever it is. And I don't wanna think that there's any correct answer to any of those questions. It would be awful bad writing a device driver in a functional language. It would be awful bad writing anything like a symbolic manipulator in a thing with complicated syntax. It's awful bad to write a numerical program in anything but Fortran.\" —Gerald Sussman "

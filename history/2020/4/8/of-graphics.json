To me, a framebuffer is a GPU memory surface that gets copied to the screen - I work for NVIDIA, so I have hardware bias :wink:.  The approach of using a memory buffer then copying it to the screen using an OS specific path, as <@UJN1TAYEQ> suggests sounds good to me :slightly_smiling_face:\nOpenGL remains the best supported way to do that on any platform.  Any version of it will be able to take a memory surface and copy it to the display, and it is still the first graphics API that most platforms support.   There are other ways to get a framebuffer that would work without creating an OpenGL context though.

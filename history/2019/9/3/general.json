I was a disciple of Prof. Wirth and used his Modula-2 language, perhaps one of only 100 people in the USA making products with it against the C juggernaut. The problem with language selection is 1) inertia is the most powerful force in the universe, and 2) it is an intrinsically conservative part of the brain to acquire and repeat a language, we are not wired to learn new ones, but keep using the current one,  3) humans are a herd animal, and seek safety by copying the majority, with prevents change.",

        "text": "I really like the comparative method as a way of growing one's understanding of a complex system: instead of seeing it only from the inside view, as an expert in that particular system (eg. US politics, human biology), take an outside view by comparing it to other similar things (eg. world politics &amp; history, other species).\n\nWhat I find disappointing about Kell's slides is that he applies the comparative method only half-heartedly. He claims there is a systemic problem in software-development stemming from the same roots (following Illich) as problems in medicine, transportation, and education... and then _ignores_ this comparison when he proposes solutions! In particular, he doesn't ask whether there's any evidence his proposed solution ─ changing computer science education to create a different programming culture ─ would or wouldn't also work in those other fields. Could changing medical education have made medicine more convivial? Could changing education somehow have avoided the rise of car-centric urban design? It seems unlikely, but I'd be interested to hear a counter-argument.\n\nPersonally, I suspect the root problems involved are economic. This does not make me optimistic about finding a solution any time soon, and it makes me pessimistic about the value of communities like this one, which focus primarily on _technical_ solutions.",

        "text": "Pivoting your company is a time-honored strategy. I was working on a PC game inspired by the movie \"Fantastic Voyage\" which miniaturized a ship to fix a blood clot, and was building a painting tool to help make this huge body map that animated the blood flow. I couldn't get the artist Mark Ferrari (famous pixel artist who did LucasArts games Maniac Mansion, Loom, Monkey Island, etc) to switch out of his EA Deluxe Paint II paint program so i cloned it, and then after a while developing the body game, it turned out that no retailer would accept a body game as medical software was retail poison (yeah, because medicine is so unimportant! yikes!), so I repurposed the paint program for teenagers as a sequel to KidPix, and sold a zillion copies on Floppy Disk and later on CDROM as Flying Colors. Still the best kids painting program, now freeware at <http:\/\/magicmouse.com|magicmouse.com>, and miraculously still runs in 256 color mode even on Windows 10 due to MS incredible commitment to compatibility.  It is smart when your original mission is untenable, to take what you do have and sell it.",

I went through 14 releases over 5 years, so there weren't a lot of bugs. The thing i had going for me was using Modula-2 which is like C with all the runtime and strong typing checks. For some reason Modula-2 didn't catch on like Pascal its 10 year predecessor, and i was one of only 100 people or so in the USA who bothered to use it. Exactly matches C feature-wise, but incredibly code bases are only about half the length because of the superior code sharing brought about by the clever module system. the ES 2016 JS module system is a bastard child of the Modula-2 system; they bungled a whole bunch of details.",

        "text": "Prof. Wirth wrote Pascal, a huge success and the UCSD pascal system was a contender for the IBM PC. However MS got the contract, and that finished that off. 10 years later was Modula-2, then later was Oberon. Oberon was used to make a whole OS from bare hardware, an incredible achievement for a team of only two dozen people. They sold hardware for a while, called the Lilith machine. It was inspired by Wirth's sabbatical at Xerox PARC; his version of the Alto machine. Anyway Oberon had a design flaw where Wirth had removed enumerated types which are omnipresent in Modula-2, and the thousands of people who had built up huge code bases around the world couldn't easily migrate their code, because when you remove a key feature from a language, it means a massive refactoring effort for minimal benefits. So he derailed his user base by not creating a bridge from his prior work. Academics live in their own world, and they get a fresh crop of graduate students on which to experiment every year, but commercial companies build a code base and sell it for decades, and depend on continuity, and any major change has to have a clean migration path or it doesn't happen. Which is why COBOL is still used in places, because there was no perceived easy way out short of a complete rewrite.\n\nThe whole love of Linux to me seems ill-founded; the Oberon system with dynamic linking and the fantastic simplicity is less than 1\/10th the complexity of Linux. What really bothers me about the end of the Lilith\/Oberon project is that i haven't seen a practical tool that i wanted to use come out of academia since. Some brutal disconnection process has occurred between Academics and industry. I have no idea why, but i can sure see the results.",

Here's my bastardized paraphrase:\n\n&gt; Google Search, from the perspective of the web searcher, isn't a pure function — every time you do a Google search for the same term, you get a different result. You could try to model it as a pure function, but that'd require some contortions that are easy to describe (\"Just take the current index as an additional hidden \/ curried argument\") but that fall apart upon further reflection. Google search is actually a _process_, not a function, and rather than trying to model it using the ill-fitting formalisms of math, we can more naturally model it using the formalisms of systems theory.\n\nOO embodies some elements of process \/ systems theory very elegantly. Erlang is probably a great touchstone here. Compare with Milner's π-calculus, a mathematical formalism that encodes some parts of process \/ systems theory, which I find to be not nearly as simple or elegant as the _very OO_ process model in Erlang.\n\n(Hedging against expected counterarguments: Of course, that doesn't mean there _can't_ be a way to encode process \/ systems theory in mathematics that is simple and elegant. But I think it's fair to say that this is a case where _currently_ OO does better than FP.)",

For me 'identity' is that very aspect which is preserved while the thing itself changes. _The tree grows_ - is it the same tree tomorrow? There's definitely an aspect of identifying the tree that we wish to preserve even though there are new leaves present.\n\nWhen I drive the car around and the gasoline, temperature and location fluctuate, does it remain the same car every moment or are there monads involved?\n\nThis notion of identity is so deeply ingrained in our interactions that it is almost invisible. Virtual things in computers have identity too. I may regenerate _the file_, move around _the paddle_ to hit _the moving ball_. Even looking at a function pipeline that operates on data, I might track *this data* as it moves through the functions. I'm arguing that everything that is presented to us and all our interaction with computers involve identities of these virtual artifacts. Identities are tracked in FP by various patterns like attaching ids to data, logging, maybe STM and so on. In Excel, for example, I think of location as identity (_this_ cell). By contrast OO tends to lack the 'consistent snapshot' notions represented easily in FP. I don't think there's any dichotomy here btw. I just think it's better to have an OO substrate and then incorporate the notions consistent snapshots and pure transforms.",

I tend to find that this is one area where bits are not like atoms, and our intuitions about the notion of identity don't really translate. You can't rely on analogies here.\n\nJust this past week I had an incident at work where a pipeline somewhere got wedged and refused to make forward progress. Turned out a user somewhere had changed the name of a record. Then 10 minutes later they changed their mind, reverted the old record, created a new record with the new name. But in the meantime the pipeline had run and the new name was saved downstream. Further updates failed; you couldn't create a new record with the new name because the name already existed.\n\nThe pipeline assumed that only the id of the record decided identity, but the uniqueness constraint meant that the name was also effectively part of the identity of a record. These sorts of subtle bugs are very common, I'm sure you've encountered them. Asking when two values are snapshots of 'the same record' is often intractable. The insight of FP is to encourage architectures that sidestep the question altogether. And if we could resolve the performance problems we'd use this idea exclusively. Mutation should be merely a hack for performance.",

Great thread.\n\n&gt; If it wasn't for the 'sameness' across those different scattered bits, this wouldn't be a bug, would it? :wink:\n\nThe bug was just that the pipeline was wedged. It really didn't matter whether name `X` got assigned row `m` or `n`. I think that's extremely common. Deep in the guts of our computers, software is often just arcane book-keeping without any meaningful mapping to the real world. And this has been true of bureaucracies long before software existed. Was it a Kafka short story where the guy's record says he's dead and he can't convince the bureaucrat that he's alive? I think focusing on 'identity' risks confusing map for territory.",

Please help me finding these out:)\n\nSo these are related to the OO substates and mutability vs immutabilty mentioned above, but I'd like just to give some high level thoughts.\n\n1. 0 or 1 ref to a piece of data is no problem for sure, things go crazy above 2+ references to the same piece of data.\n2. A. Multiple (sub)states enable different rate of (state) change in different parts of the system, meaning loose(r) coupling.\n2. B. Multiple (sub)states introduce a syncronization problem\/requirement on a higher level: between the subsystems using the (sub)states.\n3. Using a mutable variable by the reference feels like an implicit subscription \/ an implicit syncronization pattern.\n4. There is too much ideas around time (syncronization and subscription): maybe the idea of state is just too low level to be useful and a state should be viewed as a snapshot in a \"stateStream\" to be even able to reason about?\n5. Immutable data encourages creating new pieces of data (+swapping references) so we end up managing (and syncig) multiple pieces of data like in OO (sub)states.\n6. Virtually everything can be solved purely with mutable\/immutable data with some extra code, so it seems they just have different \"defaults\" in their meaning, requiring different extra pieces of code to mimic the others behaviour.\n7. Immutability and local state feel like a bit like \"locks\". Wat.\n+1: Wtf am I talking about? I mean I can't express these better but it feels really odd.",

The models of pure functional code and 'sending a message' are incompatible enough to require a fair bit of algebraic gymnastics.\n\nIn modern languages, \"OOP\" is just classes and inheritance, and \"sending a message\" is just overwrought terminology for indirect function call. Even in Smalltalk, message sends have synchronous function call semantics. Functional languages also have function calls. O'Caml is a pedigreed functional language with OOP (as in: classes and inheritance), so there's no conflict between FP and class based OOP. When you talk about \"sending a message to another process\", it sounds like you are talking about the Actor model. The only Actor language I know is Erlang, which is considered a functional language.",

Every general purpose language has threads and concurrency, and threads are useless unless they can change state in response to messages (or whatever the IPC mechanism is). Haskell has several IPC mechanisms: if you use the Control.Concurrent.Actors library, you can even use the Actor model.\n\nWhat makes Erlang functional is that data structures are immutable values and variables are immutable: they cannot be reassigned once they are bound to a value.\n\nAn Erlang process manages its mutable state using a tail recursive function F that is passed the current process state as an argument. Each time F is called, it receives a message, processes it, then calls itself with its updated state as an argument. This is a functional style, not an OOP style of programming.",

In typical OO an object is always pointing to the latest version of everything else - even if the latest version is only half done for some objects (this is the pitfall of OO). Ideally you want to move your references to the latest version in some organized way. And you never want to be pointing a half-done state of anything. FP typically doesn't have widespread stateStreams (well there's Clojure refs..) and you may have to build these streams yourself if you need from the immutable substrates. I think a more approachable option may to keep the OO model but introduce _deep versioning_ of objects so they can manage their evolution through their stateStream.",

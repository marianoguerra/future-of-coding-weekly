And I think in some cases showing blocks with a border and a different background color works well, e.g. to show where functions begin\/end. I think the mapping from the stylized representation to JS is a bit confusing though, e.g. why change \"x = 0\" to \"x : 0\"? And I'd prefer to see colors used for semantics more than syntax, e.g. one color for \"standard library stuff\" and another for \"calls to linear algebra functions\" and a third for \"my graphics code\". Or, alternately, one color for reading, one for mutation, one for function calls, etc...",

        "text": "From the FAQ: \"Tree Notation is the first notation where a visual design tool can generate code as good as someone can write by hand. Traditional languages have a critical flaw–there are infinite ways to represent any given structure. In Tree Notation there is only 1 way to represent 1 structure. This simplification is one of a few core reasons why Tree Notation is helping solve the Visual Programming problem.\"\nI don't get this. Sure, there are many ways to encode the same program in PLs (e.g. single-line vs. multi-line arrays), but that's a feature and not a flaw. It allows programmers to insert whitespace such that the program becomes as readable as possible. Tree Notation seems disallow this. Sure, this means that it's easier for a VPL to generate human-grade code, but only because the human-grade code in Tree Notation is less readable than in current PLs. That's not an improvement for me.",

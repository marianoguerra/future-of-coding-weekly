        "text": "<@UCGAK10LS> - Great point about abstraction! Unfortunately, many devs unknowingly confuse \"abstraction\" with other things. So here's a bit on that to help Nick's point get across more clearly:\n\nProgrammers often call it \"abstraction\" when a placeholder is used to refer to something specified or defined elsewhere. But that's not abstraction, it's indirection. And if the idea is for various different entities (or different implementations) to fill that placeholder, then that's *composition*.\n\nAbstraction means throwing out unimportant \/ irrelevant details -- not hiding or separating them, but excluding them altogether.\n\nThis is especially confusing in class-based languages wherein classes and methods are labeled \"abstract\" when they lack a (default) implementation.\n\nFor example, consider an \"abstract class\" C with members X Y Z. What makes it abstract is not that X Y Z are implemented elsewhere, but that sub-class S may *also* define A B C. So the code can say \"give me a C\" (something with X Y Z), but you can give it an S (i.e something with A B C X Y Z) without it knowing that A B C even exist. Class C is only marked as \"abstract\" because it is *only* an abstraction for other things (rather than a concrete thing itself)\n\n\"Abstract\" *methods* are even more misleading, because they imply that abstract means \"implemented elsewhere\". However, \"abstract\" here does not mean that the method *itself* is abstract, but that it is *only* (a *concrete*) part of the definition of the enclosing \"abstract *class*\" (e.g. \"some object with an X Y Z location in 3D space\").\n\nAbstraction is when you draw a circle and say \"this is my car\", when in reality a car has many moving parts &amp; behaviors. In a program, it's representing your car as a few numbers (as part of a class or otherwise) because your program is only concerned with the car's position and speed.",

I accept all the following definitions for example:\n\n1. Abstraction as naming (what you call indirection). This is a tool to manage complexity. This is how Sussman and Abelson uses the term in SICP. This is an abstraction because it hides the implementation details.\n\n2. Abstraction as \"abstract\" (or not realized). This is the definition used for ADTs and abstract classes for example.\n\n3. Abstraction as uniform interface. Some people are uncomfortable using abstraction for everything in (1) and (2) and prefer to reserve usage of the term for \"good abstractions\". Abstractions obtained by applying the process of abstraction and that are generic enough to be useful in multiple places.\n\n4. Abstraction as model. This is your definition I believe. It is about removing the details of reality you don't care about.",

Including the authors!\n• Understanding of how people use a program is poor.\n• Users can only use programs, not modify them locally. At best they can suggest changes (including code), but the authors control when changes get ‘merged’.\n• Programs have to be ‘compatible’ and not break existing users. This creates an implicit incumbency advantage where existing users get to lord it over future users. Even if they’re outnumbered by many orders of magnitude! We forget that potential is always greater than reality.\n\nSo even if you as a single user of a programmer have all your needs met, if somebody else has a feature request, and it’s accepted, you face ‘peer pressure’ to incorporate this feature in your local deployment of the program.\n\nCoda or bonus: paying for software doesn’t help much with these questions.\n\nMuch of what I do involves questioning this social contract. Unfortunately all existing software is governed with this contract, so solving the social problem seems to involve a technical sub-goal. Or maybe that’s fortunate, since I am better at writing code than solving social problems. Maybe I just feel more useful\/effective this way? :thinking_face:",

A language that also has ownership might map well, but Rust wants this done statically, so the semantics would have to map almost 1:1 for this to work. Beyond that, you are in the territory of emulating things. A reference counted language would work decently well for Rust. Most dynamically typed languages, or GC languages, are so far removed from Rust that there's no meaningfull advantage to Rust's type safety and ownership anymore. Some dynamically typed languages could be implemented directly using a Rust enum, but if you look at the crazy shit many language implementations do with memory, you'll end up with.. the array of bytes as the only translation mechanism. And random access arrays in Rust will not compete with C because of bounds checking, correct me if I am wrong.",

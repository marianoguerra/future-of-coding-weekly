        "text": "Hi folks!\n\nI developed following webapp a few years ago and although I was (and still am) quite excited about the possibilities, I never released it. I couldn't imagine the programming community at large get excited about it. Also I was sick of preaching things nobody else seems to care about.\n\nBut now that I discovered this community, maybe a few of you might like it:\n\n<https:\/\/syvis.surge.sh\/ErZoPhsMTcDvGT9pZswo\/>\nFeel free to try it out with other JavaScript code. It completely runs in your Browser!\n\nMy thought process was that -- despite their flaws -- text editors are a quite powerful input method once you mastered the keyboard.\nConsuming \/ investigating code in a text editor, however, not so. Our syntax highlighting, code style guides, indentation based code, etc. are just a desperate attempt to mitigate this.\n\nWhat if coding was more like writing a LaTeX paper? The LaTeX code is good to build the document, and for reviewing and distributing it, the rendered PDF is much better suited.\n\nNext steps could be:\n\n- Custom themes, so that you can render the code to you liking\n- Enable interactive editing for minor things like changing a number or a  string, reordering parts, …\n\nHere is another abstract from a slightly different angle:\n\nIn most programming languages\nthe semantic meaning of a program is disconnected from\nthe formatting of the code and the naming of variables and keywords.\nThis means semantically equivalent code can be written in a vastly\ndifferent textual representations.\nThis poses problems in terms of readability and understandability\nof code.\nEven minor modifications of punctuation or formatting in comparison to\na developers familiar style can drastically decrease the performance.\nIn order to mitigate these problems I propose to visualize code\nin a graphical and deterministic way.\nInstead of relying on the author of the code to format it in a acceptable\nmanner, each developer can choose a visualization of their liking.\nThis has the potential to decrease the error rate and\nincrease the development speed of programmers.\n\nLooking foward to you feedback! :grin:",

Thanks for the pointer.\n\n&gt; it's hard to see whether such a representation is more readable than current code\n\nOf course it needs some getting used to. If you never had seen code before it would be highly unreadable and off-putting.  I definitely noticed how it got much easier for me to see the patterns and make sense of the code during the development.\n\nSince the design is only definied by a CSS stylesheet I'd be really interested in seeing other people's take on how the code should be rendered!\n\nI've dabbled with structural editors as well and I think it will be incredible hard to impossible with normal programming languages and our current input methods. With a custom build programming language and novel input techniques e.g. touchscreen of immersive VR environments it might be possible.\nThis could be a good intermediate step.",

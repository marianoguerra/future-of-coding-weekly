Your device might run out of battery, your internet connection might drop or you might destroy the device itself. The traditional answer to this is to use \"the cloud\" which has all the disadvantages you mention in your post. I was thinking that home servers might be the solution to that. This would make sure you're highly available (for receiving or providing information) without having to give your data to some distant data center. If setting up a home server and connecting it to your devices was as easy as setting up Amazon Echo, we'd probably see a lot more people doing it. Friends could even decide to connect their servers, thereby increasing availability and fault-tolerance. What do you think?",

                "text": "Eudaimonia  (Greek: εὐδαιμονία [eu̯dai̯moníaː]), sometimes anglicized as eudaemonia or eudemonia , is a Greek word commonly translated as happiness or welfare; however, \"human flourishing or prosperity\"  and \"blessedness\" have been proposed as a more accurate translations.\nEtymologically, it consists of the words \"eu\" (\"good\") and \"daimōn\" (\"spirit\"). It is a central concept in Aristotelian ethics and political philosophy, along with the terms \"aretē\", most often translated as \"virtue\" or \"excellence\", and \"phronesis\", often translated as \"practical or ethical wisdom\". In Aristotle's works, eudaimonia (based on older Greek tradition) was used as the term for the highest human good, and so it is the aim of practical philosophy, including ethics and political philosophy, to consider (and also experience) what it really is, and how it can be achieved.\nDiscussion of the links between virtue of character (ēthikē aretē) and happiness (eudaimonia) is one of the central concerns of ancient ethics, and a subject of much disagreement. As a result there are many varieties of eudaimonism. Two of the most influential forms are those of Aristotle and the Stoics. Aristotle takes virtue and its exercise to be the most important constituent in eudaimonia but acknowledges also the importance of external goods such as health, wealth, and beauty. By contrast, the Stoics make virtue necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia and thus deny the necessity of external goods.",

        "text": "I've been thinking about this in the context of Curv, my future-of-coding project.\n\nWhen you run the Curv app, or run the Curv programming environment in a web browser, you should have access to all of your projects, and you should also be able to browse other people's projects, and link to other people's libraries. All this code should be stored \"in the cloud\", so that you can access your stuff from any device, and so that other people can access stuff you have published.\n\nHow does this cloud storage work? Do I have to run a public facing server, <http:\/\/curvhub.com|curvhub.com>, which stores everybody's projects? Do I pay for it by vacuuming up personal information and displaying ads? Does everybody lose all of their data if <http:\/\/curvhub.com|curvhub.com> shuts down some day?\n\nOr maybe FOCI, the Future Of Coding Institute, with long term funding ensured by a $50M endowment from a tech billionaire, provides cloud storage on <http:\/\/codehub.org|codehub.org> for future-of-coding projects. As discussed in the Research-Centre channel.\n\nThere is now an internet subculture around creating an independent, distributed, decentralized internet infrastructure. Mastodon replaces twitter, and so on. How would a decentralized CurvHub work? Maybe it uses IPFS (the interplanetary file system), and maybe the Curv app runs IPFS nodes on mobiles, laptops and desktops. I've never tried this technology, so I don't know how fast and reliable it would be compared to something like <http:\/\/github.com|github.com>.",

        "text": "My project is a language for procedurally generated visual art. It works well for my personal needs, and some people on the internet use it. I've talked to a lot of artists in my local community, and not many local artists can program. Those that do mostly use node-and-wire languages. One artist said that he could modify existing GLSL source code (for doing GPU shader effects in the Magic node-and-wire language), but he can't write this kind of source code from scratch. But node-and-wire programming is not a problem.\n\nI don't use node-and-wire languages myself. To test your claim about no if or let, I opened the Wikipedia page for Max-MSP. There is a screenshot of a Max program. It contains a large switch statement: There is a \"key\" node, and the output value flows into many \"select\" nodes, each of which are individual cases in the switch. There are also several \"if\" nodes. \"Let\" nodes for binding local variables seem unnecessary because the output of one node can be routed via branching wires to multiple inputs.\n\nTo me, the Max code is ugly and unstructured: it looks like a plate of spaghetti. I analysed the code into a hierarchical structure within my minds eye, including an imagined 'switch statement', but there's no hierarchy on the screen, just spaghetti. But not everybody's brain is wired the same way. I am very comfortable with text, grammar, mathematics, structure, hierarchy. I meet visual artists who can effortlessly draw in a way that feels beyond my abilities. I show some of these artists my code, and they just see gibberish.\n\nOne of the questions that interests me is, how to design a programming environment for artists? How does your brain work if you can rapidly draw a realistic figurative scene, but grammar is not your thing? You have relatively more grey matter for processing visual scenes, relatively less for parsing text. The node-and-wire presentation might be a lot easier for you to process.",

Most often it's a mix of words, diagrams, tables, concepts and structures I can't even describe properly. I use text \/ words for communicating ideas mainly because that's what most communication channels support. Speaking and text messages just work with text \/ words. If there was a way in which I could directly communicate my thoughts to someone else without encoding them as words first, I would probably prefer that because there wouldn't be as much \"loss in translation\". My hand-written notes aren't purely textual and I can express my thoughts much better on paper because of that flexibility.",

        "text": "Almost all text is ambiguous in some way and needs interpretation. Humans are really good at this (but not even close to perfect). Computers aren't good at dealing with ambiguities (and I'd argue they shouldn't have to deal with ambiguities at all). Because programs stored as text are ambiguous (e.g. \"Which version of Python does this script require?\", \"Where do I find the library 'numpy'? And what version do I need?\"), we invented a whole bunch of bolt-on tools (e.g. dependency management) and rules so that our programs become less ambiguous.\n\nIt's clear that these ambiguities need to be resolved, but we can choose when to do that. I'd argue that it should happen as soon as possible. For example, your editor should know that you write Python 3.7 by default and encode that in the storage representation unless you specify something else. The representation shared between people should be unambiguous.\n\nThink of it like talking to a (human) assistant. If you tell them \"Please call Mary and tell her that Tom wants to meet her at 8PM\", the assistant would probably ask which 'Tom' you meant and would assume that the time was referring to your current time zone. Using the additional information, the assistant could inform Mary (assuming that 'Mary' is unambiguous). If they'd just do the call (without asking for clarification), Mary would have to guess the exact meaning of 'Tom' and the time.\n\nIn programming we're guessing and working around ambiguity issues all the time and I wonder if another storage representation could solve this.",

I'm also reading 'Metaphors We Live By' (Lakoff) and am getting convinced that a lot of understanding and reasoning is about placing some ideas into metaphors of various kinds.

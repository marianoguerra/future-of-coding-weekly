        "text": "Hello, I’m the CEO of <http:\/\/www.hyperfiddle.net\/> which is a FOC startup currently based in Philadelphia. Hyperfiddle basically takes the Clojure\/Datomic information model and extends it through to user interfaces. While the technology is interesting, we think a large part of the work is forming a strategy to get adoption at scale (a smooth path from 0 to 1 to 100 to 100k) and also figuring out an economic model to fund the work.\n\nWe are bullish on Clojure because Clojure satisfies the criteria of “smooth adoption path” and has a lot of deeply interesting properties, such as the cost of porting Clojure to a new platform is within about a man-year of effort. Clojure on N platforms makes it possible to build distributed systems across platforms with shared information model, data structures and code. A unified\/holistic model. So while Clojure is certainly not perfect, it is designed for real-world usage and makes practical compromises to achieve growth. We see Hyperfiddle as just one component of a self-organizing movement which is larger than any one project or company funding 100% of the work.",

There is even one gist with step by step instructions that doesn't work at all if you follow them, because of some wrong syntax when calling clang. That thing should had never worked for anyone yet the gist is full of \"thanks!\" \"this is great\" comments from other developers from an alternate universe where clang actually works with these made up parameters :^).

        "text": "&gt; One main question I am currently focusing on is: What is a (computer) program?\n\nBrilliant question. To me the program concept is turning out be something of a diversion. We think we work with one program mostly but in reality we work with a cacophony of them and other non-programmy things (shared libraries - are they inside my program or outside?). Roughly a program seems like a static description of some automated **process**. I'd argue that the processes of interest mostly span slices across multiple such definitions. I'm trying to focus away from the idea of a program and instead think about the larger context of the 'system'. See <https:\/\/shalabh.com\/programmable-systems\/systems-not-programs.html>",

        "text": "One could argue that editing LaTeX code but looking at rendered pdfs is a flaw not a feature. LaTeX editors try to mitigate this by live rendering the document on the side, but this is still not ideal, because your cursor is on the left in the code and you're looking at the rendered pdf on the right. Some editors even show the cursor position in the rendered pdf. In the limit this seems to converge to showing all relevant information as an overlay in the rendered pdf, including the document tree, making the code view on the left side redundant.\n\nIf you have a code viewer that displays code in a superior way, then it seems to me that you'd want to use that view while editing as well.",

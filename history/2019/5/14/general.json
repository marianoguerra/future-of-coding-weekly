        "text": "I bought a lot of expensive software like Autocad, and i think for a product that complex which never stops evolving the subscription model is reasonable, but my Adobe CS5.5 Master collection which was over $1000 is just fine and i don't want to spend cumulatively thousands to add features i only use 3% of already. Anyway the evolution of Director's Lingo into Actionscript is a bit complex,  as I was merely a consumer of Adobe and Macromedia products, and i don't have insight into the various product streams and designers that were put together to produce the final product, which was AS1, then AS2 then a few years later AS3. Adobe and Macromedia had competing products in multiple areas, and there was a long-forgotten product from Adobe that could do animation and had some scripting, but the two teams were fused together (probably a very upsetting moment when all those competing project teams were locked into one room, probably lots of people storming and\/or fired). A lot of really bright people have worked for Adobe over their long history, and they have acquired and blended many things to get where they are. AS3 is 99% the same as current JS. You can with a few dozen find\/replace operations convert AS3 into JS code. They are remarkably similar.\n\nBut the implementation of modules in JS is incomplete and quite annoying. Unlike in Modula-2 which produced a special file containing the AST of the exported items of a module, which allows for separate compilation, JS modules can't do that, and you can't import a scalar value and update it from another module; you can only modify object properties. Also AS3 has int32 and unsigned32 primitive data types. Boy would it be great if JS had those, because operating systems still use such things. Another missing area is packed arrays, which are much less expensive in RAM, and for large fixed-size  tabular data would be so much more efficient. JS is a memory pig; just look at a browser's total memory footprint, and it typically exceeds the total memory used for Windows 7, which is somewhat absurd. One of the things i really hate about the modern stack is it is so heavy, so many million lines of code, and so many thousands of pages to fully document all the API's and interactions. It is ridiculously complex now.",

        "text": "Just a random thought: I was looking at Bret Victor’s old Learnable Programming, and it had a little note about how programming consists of decomposing problems, and I realized: that’s not what I do these days. I spend all my time thinking about messaging and communication between systems, and “decomposition” feels like a luxury. I don’t know if that’s a general change in programming, or just the nature of my work or professional stage… but it feels like a real change to me.\n\nThat is, I spend a lot of time thinking about these things:\n1. What are the entities in my system? These could be as simple as objects, but might be remote services, or different processes, browser tabs, etc.\n2. Who knows what?\n3. Who needs to keep track of what?\n4. From any given context, how do I get access to the other entities?\n5. How do I communicate with them? The push\/pull of functions or RPC? Pub\/sub? Some wonky event system?\n6. Where does a particular change originate, and which entities are simply reactive?\n\nThis all is where a lot of modern language development leaves me cold. Types don’t offer much here. Going further, I think there really is a kind of modernist\/postmodernist break here (ala <http:\/\/homepages.mcs.vuw.ac.nz\/~kjx\/papers\/nopp.pdf>): modern approaches attempt to create self-consistent and robust systems, and postmodernist approaches accept that we operate in a diverse systems where a lot of important things happen at the intersection of incompatible modernist systems.\n\nI don’t have any conclusion in mind, but I’d be interested in people’s thoughts.",

To me, it would seem, with reactive datalog, a lot of translation code between nodes that are separate in size and distance (db, server, browser) become un-necessary. This would imply a multiplicative reduction in codebase size and proportionately reduced complexity.\n\nI would across the software community were seeing an effort to push reactiveness into a component of the database, which of course, just shifts the effort, but does so in a manor that makes the tools (databases) easier to understand, rather then trying to bootsrape the functionality into your system later. Examples such as rethinkdb (rip), kafka streaming, spark, flink all do this at scale, but are unwiedly for small teams. More accessible reactive databases like firebase have a limited query  language and no universal way to update your client (browser) db.\n\nSo with that in mind, im very interested in:\n\n• thoughts on reactive databases in general\n• thoughts on how to sync browser state with the database\n• examples of existing works and papers\n• mathematical models surrounding these concepts (algorithms, proofs etc...)\n• tradeoffs, maybe a reactive database requires vastly more memory and space?",

In Sussman's heyday there were only a few hundred computers in existence, and now that computers are everywhere, and there are millions of programmers, it is extremely important to be able to read and use other people's code. Take some random chunk of LISP and good luck trying to fit that.

It didn’t have negative connotations in my mind.\n\nThe recent thread on distributed computing may be relevant if you hadn’t already seen it: <https:\/\/futureofcoding.slack.com\/archives\/C5T9GPWFL\/p1557434052245400>\n\nI’m trying to be cognizant of my modernist bias, but there are levels of questions here:\n• How much of the difficulty creating abstractions that work across systems is due to design failures in individual systems?\n• Is it possible to cross the chasm to new, equally diverse systems that don’t suffer from those foundational design flaws?\n\nValid answers:\n• No matter what you do, the complexity of integrating across system boundaries will dominate. (In all domains?)\n• Maybe there’s a perfect world somewhere, but there’s no way for us to get there. We’re locked in by past decisions.\n• Change all the things!\n\nI think the answer depends on domain. Games, for example, often don’t have to deal with multiple platforms, and where they do they can polyfill the heck out of them to make integration plug and play. But that’s of course just one tiny end of the spectrum.\n\nOne may also be able to get away with modernism at lower layers of the stack. My background is in systems programming, and that maybe explains something.\n\nAnyways, just trying to throw out ideas that someone else can maybe run with to show me the limitations of my worldview:\n• Yes, we can and should change all the things.\n• Good fences make good neighbors. Good components simplify integration problems.\n• It will take a long time. Probably longer than a lifetime.\n• Nobody will ever have all the answers, so above all make foundational design decisions open to revision (with less effort than it will take with the current stack).\n• Lots of respect for people who have to live with and deal with the current state of the world in the meantime.

Instead, the object in the program can be seen as a sign of the object in the world. Unlike abstractions, which can be reasoned about using deduction (from causes to effects), signs are effectively implications, and are modelled using abduction (reasoning from effects to causes).\n\n:heart: :heart:",

        "text": "&gt; This all is where a lot of modern language development leaves me cold. Types don’t offer much here.\n\nAbsolutely. A lot of 'system design' happens outside the scope of a usual programming language. In the end languages are employed in the service of the system, but there seem to be a sharp contrast in the models of composition 'in-language\/in-process' vs 'cross-process'.\n\n&gt;  I spend all my time thinking about messaging and communication between systems, and “decomposition” feels like a luxury.\n\nYes. There is an incredible amount of model duplication in the way we build systems today. Each part is like an island where you define, from the ground up, each of the entities you wish to deal with in that island. The description of the larger system-wide entities and processes is shredded into little pieces, glued together with implementation details such as messaging libraries, and separated into various such islands.\n\n(From the linked paper)\n&gt; We consider that the term “program” is both too big and too little for post modern computer science.\n&gt; “Program” is too small because often we are  working on multiple programs.\nI suppose I heavily lean towards post-modern in this regard. \"Programs\" aren't interesting to me anymore and any model where you first compose programs (~processes) and then compose them into systems doesn't scale up well. Instead what's interesting is the whole lifecycle of the system, inspecting and updating the higher level processes that it embodies. Can we work with these directly? Update them, see the inspect the hypothetical effect on other processes, etc.? I wrote a bit here: <https:\/\/futureofcoding.slack.com\/archives\/C5T9GPWFL\/p1557508482325700>",

Particularly these last couple of years writing decentralized systems writes can come at me from anywhere at any time -- if I had to translate those back into specific \"display updates\" the reconciliation would be abominable. Vice versa, by channeling writes through a single point I get tremendous leverage to be able to interpose whatever storage engine I want. The flip side of all this, of course, is that it doesn't scale. By that I mean that the abstraction breaks down inevitably when speed becomes a first-order concern. That happens in SQL databases when you get a few gigabytes more data than your system has RAM (if not before) or in Elm \/ React when you are trying to respond on the next frame for things like text entry.",

        "text": "I just came across this video of Alan Kay delving deep into what \"object oriented\" really meant, and how it differs from other systems and languages that later claimed to be OO:\n\n<https:\/\/youtu.be\/QjJaFG63Hlo>\n\nThere's also this similar (shorter and less in-depth) one by Dan Ingalls:\n\n<https:\/\/youtu.be\/Ao9W93OxQ7U>\n\nA few interesting points that I gathered:\n\n* It's not OO without message passing (e.g. you can request an object to do something, but it's not a command like a method-call is).\n* This is partly so that the \"message\" remains intact at runtime, rather than being compiled away, so that (for example) you could later substitute different objects that reasons to the same messages, without breaking anything.\n* Classes and static types are not that important. It's more about the objects and messages\n* One goal is to get rid of the idea of \"control flow\" passing from one object to another, and instead have each advertize what it needs or what it's intent is, and let a kernel do the \"wiring\" automatically. Objects can thus run in parallel, or even in different machines, and the communication \/ execution is the same.\n* Modularity actually ends up being much less important than having much smaller systems &amp; code. The OO approach Kay gives (if done right) allows code to be reduced enormously, but at the cost of not being modular. But so what, because the whole thing (whatever it may be) is very simple to understand and maintain and change.\n* Apparently MVC (model, view, controller) was built-in, and you never need any code for keeping track of or updating what is displayed anywhere. Instead, each object just provides a spec for how it should be drawn or displayed, and the kernel automatically takes care of getting updated views of the object at regular intervals (when it has changed)\n\n(I might have some of this a bit wrong, and maybe some of it is specific to SmallTalk. My point here is just to give a hint of what you might find in these videos, and what you might think about if you (e.g. <@UCQ4BBFQ9>?) want to experiment with an \"actual\" OO system)",

Mostly because I’m too dense for these ideas to even register. (However, being blase about “faults in construction” is hard to stomach.)\n• Section 7: I love the idea of “ancient programs living in connection with programs not yet written”. Here’s my original introduction post from last year: <https:\/\/futureprogramming.slack.com\/archives\/CC2JRGVLK\/p1536962970000100>\n• Section 8: I’ve written about our over-reliance on modules: <http:\/\/akkartik.name\/post\/modularity>. I care primarily about encouraging outsiders to read source code, and there’s a fundamental tension there: abstractions help authors manage a codebase but initially hinder outsiders in understanding the codebase.\n\nAlright, I’m done navel-gazing.",

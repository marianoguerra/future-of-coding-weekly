My guess is most serious applications that a senior might design look more like spreadsheets, or an ECA system, and wouldn't necessarily have the primitives to make compelling games or interactive art\\stories that more kid focused environments like scratch or etoys encourage.  This comes back to <@UCUSW7WVD>'s comment that simplifying programming language doesn't help much, you need to build environments that empower people",

They gave us a curriculum provided by a local boot camp. The result was that the entire 9-week program was dedicated to having each kid build the same website, with a bit of flexibility for styling. I had to fight the system to give the kids in my classroom freedom to pursue the projects they actually wanted to work on.\n\nThe perception among educators seems to be that because programming is considered a STEM field, it can be effectively taught like a math class. The teacher presents the material, the kids are assigned homework problems, and the teacher grades the resulting work. This is not how anyone that I know who loves programming learned to code. In my experience, coding is much better learned the way an artist learns to paint or a writer to write. Rather than giving the kids homework assignments specially crafted to be easy to grade, we should be giving them freedom to pursue whatever projects interest them, and provide guidance and support in helping them to choose projects that are achievable and will stretch them. I find that the things I learn actually stick with me if I discover them for myself.",

I’m Ian (but you could tell that already), from Minneapolis.\n\nI’m particularly interested in programming environments – for instance, notebook interfaces seem like the most notable programming exploration of the moment. But the specific project I’ve been mulling over and experimenting with is using fully automated testing (like fuzzing) of interactive applications to collect execution information to support the programmer. I imagine a system where you can get a map of what the application actually does (intentional or not), and then you can explore down into _why_ it does those things.\n\nBut it’s a side project, so maybe more dream than reality, but I’m sure I’m not alone :wink:",

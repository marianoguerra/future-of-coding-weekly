Existing\/professionnal programmers will follow next if the designed new programming experience is efficient in regard to their buisness. So target children and hobbyists first, make them have fun and ensure programming is easy for them (yet \"serious\" programming). And better: let's those new creative minds bring their ideas of a better way to do programming.",

At Google IO yesterday they showed that their new smart speaker thing can pause music when you make a certain gesture (<https:\/\/youtu.be\/lyRPyRKHO8M?t=4604>). In the video, the woman gets called on her smartphone and then uses a gesture to pause the music. Probably better than a voice command, but they won't get my applause until they either forward the call to the smart speaker or reduce music volume automatically when the smartphone gets called. It's 2019 and two devices used by the same person in the same room still can't cooperate on something like this. That's kind of embarrassing, isn't it?\nAnyway, the crowd seemed to love it...",

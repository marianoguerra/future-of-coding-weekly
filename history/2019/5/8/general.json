        "text": "<@UHS9K1N6A>: re \"I think the point of Urbit is that from the Martian’s perspective, it is us javascript plebs who are the nutty ones\"  not quite so, I think one of the challenges of discovering what computation is about , remember alan kay says the computer revolution hasn't happend yet, is to explore the relationship between the individual and the group. Terms like \"persistence\" or \"identity\" try to negotiate between those. As humans we can not extract ourselves from neither our human history nor our biological history. So we are complex and mostly contradictory beings and we suffer through life. But we create technology and technology gives us mechanisms to reflect about ourselves and simultaneously changes our behavior. Its both a  conscious and unconscious process. So this is Urbit an attempt to collapse layers of technical and maybe historical complexity into something more useful.",

        "text": "<@UAVCC2X70> Thank you Dan for sharing this! I hadn't  heard of  François-René Rideau before, but his description and comparison of urbit is really one of the best I have found so far yet. Still it seems a bit too narrowly technical focused. I did very much like when the author used terms like micro and macro level, because it shows that we need better terminology to discuss about computing.  I think urbit tries to create a programming culture on its own. Yes it seems inaccessible but only so for people familiar with a programming context previously. I don't think that urbit has all the answers. But i DO think its asks interesting questions! Now articulating these questions and even arguing them is a whole different issue. I argue, we have come to the boundaries of usefullness of human natural lanugage to do. I'm uncertain how the future will unfold or if we ever will \"fix\" programming or technology will simply outpace us and brain computer interfaces make a lot of the things we do with computers today make look like incomprehensible child's play.",

And people have done this using these platforms for some time. But obviously issues arise  or changes comes to play, since \"the medium is the massage\" and people are becoming more and more dissatisfied with the current state of these. Twitter for example has changed a lot in the last 10 years. These days it feels like that are more bots and less humane interactions on twitter possible than before. Reasons for that are complex but exaclty because of that I do not believe that a single\/centralized company can resolve these issues, that is impossible. Again I think these \"social networks\" will gravitate towards open dialog protocols.",

The way I'd put it is: you can reason informally (or prove if you had the time and inclination) that two functions (or expressions) are equivalent in some mathematical\/denoational sense but their runtime characteristics can be very different. For example, various definitions of fibbonacci.\n\nI'm also interested in what it would look like for performance characteristics to be composible, if that'd even make sense. So that you could reason about performance of an expression by it's constituent parts and their combining forms. \n\nMaybe like this <https:\/\/granule-project.github.io\/index.html>",

So that you can judge the final appearance without needing to learn how to foresee how the wet painting will change appearance as it slowly dries.\n\nHow about a canvas that you can make more or less transparent, so you can look through the canvas at your subject, and trace their form?",

That's their very purpose. But they can also hit screws, which is a great way to make a screw stay put while you reach for the screwdriver. They can also dent and deform sheet metal, which is useful for crafting a steel drum. They can knock loose a stuck fitting or lid, especially when hitting the free end of a long wrench on a stuck nut. They can punch a hole in drywall, making it easier to tear down. They can also smash your hand.\n\nHammers are tools for working with nails. This is a conceptual constraint placed on hammers by their designers. Hammers are designed with this specific intent in mind. But sometimes, hammers are just tools for amplifying the force of your arm. Sometimes, hammers are but tools for surviving a forceful impact. To your humble author, hammers are tools for exploring ideas via metaphor, with a wink. But by design, hammers are for nails. You won't find them in the \"force multipliers\" aisle of your hardware store, nor the \"impact surviving\" aisle.",

But in very broad terms, let's consider the 'space of images' as a high dimensional arbitrary space, turns out there is a transformation of this space (defined in abstract terms) that exposes a geometrical structure which makes this data very easy to work with, classify things, cluster them, etc... For this I had to learn differential geometry and a little bit of differential topology, so far I'm loving this new (for me) math, but I'm still a novice in these things!",

        "text": "Hi all, I am an art historian turned philosopher and historian of computing – . I was lucky enough to get a permanent research position at a time when I was starting to despair a bit and still feel as one of the most lucky persons when I realize I have this job. It gave me a new kind of freedom which I didn’t have in previous academic positions; and it took me quite a while to realize that.  I am very much engaged with retracing and rendering transparent through history where we are now with computing technology – as so many others; I worry a lot about this broad and disconnected field; I very much like an approach of asking rather basic questions (I guess that is the philosopher in me) which, at first sight, almost seem trivial but once one starts to dig a bit, seem to be quite hard. One main question I am currently focusing on is: What is a (computer) program? This is the guiding question of a research project I am coordinating and which involves historians, philosophers, computer scientists and some programmers. Note: the choice for \"program\" and not software; code; algorithm; etc is not arbitrary – I think it kind of comprises\/implied these other notions. If anyone of you might be interested in this or anything else that is losely or strictly related to history and philosophy of computing and programs, please do share your thoughts\/concerns\/etc with me. Also: I am currently starting to collect answers from as many people as possible to the main question above and I would be happy to receive some from you too – best wishes, L",

These days I'm in the typed functional programming camp and like to think of programs as proofs, via the Curry-Howard isomorphism. So the next question is \"what is a proof?\".",

Most professional developers know shockingly little about the history of the field, and don't care to know. As a result, there is a skewed view that newer is better, and things of the past are irrelevant or more primitive or crude form of the present. Ideas from the past are widely forgotten and reinvented every decade or two, and a lot of meaning is lost and terms redefined.\n\nThe playlist I'm sharing here mainly focuses on this aspect of software history. A few of the videos focus more on a particular programming topic, but paint a historical picture in doing so.\n\nSome of the videos with Jim Coplien focus a lot on the history of software *practices* (e.g. Agile &amp; Scrum)",

        "text": "The Christopher Alexander video does not explain much about software history, but is itself a key event in software history. Alexander was looking to restore physical architecture to its more humanistic roots (find his video \"spaces for the soul\" on YouTube for more info). His \"pattern language\" theory was actually picked up by the software community, sparking a \"patterns\" movement which essentially sought to find patterns to build software that was more humane and useful to people. The founders of this movement formed \"The Hillside Group\" (find their website).\n\nHowever, \"patterns\" in software quickly devolved into ways to deal with problems in the code (e.g. like shifting from how to build a kitchen or entrance or living room that promotes togetherness while respecting personal space ... to how best to nail drywall to a wood frame). The change was solidified by a book published by 4 authors commonly known as \"The Gang of Four\" (GoF) (look it up, it's not hard to find them). The book and it's more mechanical idea of \"patterns\" still today forms a foundational part of modern software ideology.\n\nWith this flop, some key figures in software (many from the Hillside Group) sought other ways to make software more humanistic, and as a result we have \"Agile\" (see the \"Agile Manifesto\", also easy to find).\n\nThe Christopher Alexander video marks his address to the software community after this patterns movement had gained traction, and the Gang of Four book had taken its course. He talks a lot about his work, and then addresses the disparagement between it and what software has done with it.",

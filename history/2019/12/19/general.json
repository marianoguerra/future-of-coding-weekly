We've all been in other communities hosted on other platforms, and we constantly feel the comparative weaknesses of Slack. At the same time, moving the community will lose good people, and I'm not sure we can survive that sort of a seismic shift. We could also introduce a second platform as a complement to Slack, but that doubles the effort needed to keep up. And besides, this community has remote colonies on other platforms already — Lobsters, Lambda the Ultimate, Twitter, HN, Lines, XRA's Discord, and countless others. What we have right here is what it is because of Slack. The aggressiveness with which Slack forces us to lose touch with past discussions and miss out on things happening in threads has the Twitter-like consequence of restricting how much time you can spend reading. For some that's a blessing, not a curse. If we moved to a platform with better support for long-form posts and rich threads, that would surely make it easier to read everything everyone writes, but I don't know how many of us could afford to spend that sort of time. All said, I'm very sympathetic to the position of Jonathan (et al.), and want to keep the search for alternatives alive. I like the idea of starting up a shadow community on another platform just to get a feel for it, so please keep posting suggestions for that in <#CEXED56UR|meta>. If enough of us are serious about moving, and we manage to agree on a spot, and we try it out and it feels good, I'd be happy to make it an official home of the community.\n\nI'm excited that Mariano Guerra is starting a community newsletter — I really hope that takes off, as it'll probably help any eventual change to the platform our community calls home. If you have any similar project you'd like to try out on behalf of the community, I have a stamp of _Official Blessing_ that Steve left on my desk and I'm eager to use it.\n\nOf course, if you have concerns about anything that you'd rather not discuss openly, please send me a DM. I don't have any plans to explicitly change anything about how the community functions, but I am very open to new ideas.\n\nI love the energy and activity we have here. I love the split between academic research and industry practice. I love that folks are organizing meetups and helping each other find jobs. I love that many of us are working away on our own FoC projects that will take many years to come to fruition, and we'll get to share that difficult process together. Thanks everyone for making this place what it is, and I hope that we can keep it going and growing for years to come.",

We've all been in other communities hosted on other platforms, and we constantly feel the comparative weaknesses of Slack. At the same time, moving the community will lose good people, and I'm not sure we can survive that sort of a seismic shift. We could also introduce a second platform as a complement to Slack, but that doubles the effort needed to keep up. And besides, this community has remote colonies on other platforms already — Lobsters, Lambda the Ultimate, Twitter, HN, Lines, XRA's Discord, and countless others. What we have right here is what it is because of Slack. The aggressiveness with which Slack forces us to lose touch with past discussions and miss out on things happening in threads has the Twitter-like consequence of restricting how much time you can spend reading. For some that's a blessing, not a curse. If we moved to a platform with better support for long-form posts and rich threads, that would surely make it easier to read everything everyone writes, but I don't know how many of us could afford to spend that sort of time. All said, I'm very sympathetic to the position of Jonathan (et al.), and want to keep the search for alternatives alive. I like the idea of starting up a shadow community on another platform just to get a feel for it, so please keep posting suggestions for that in "

I don't have any plans to explicitly change anything about how the community functions, but I am very open to new ideas.\n\nI love the energy and activity we have here. I love the split between academic research and industry practice. I love that folks are organizing meetups and helping each other find jobs. I love that many of us are working away on our own FoC projects that will take many years to come to fruition, and we'll get to share that difficult process together. Thanks everyone for making this place what it is, and I hope that we can keep it going and growing for years to come."

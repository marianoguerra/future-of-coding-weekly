Been programming since I was a kid as a hobby, but my only formal CS class in school was done in scheme (and it definitely shows!). It's been a long path, but I've moved my way from doing Analog IC's to Embedded Systems to now, where I am part of a team building a platform for distributed soft real-time control of robotic systems that are reactive to their environment. It's a super exciting project because we get to explore a ton of neat areas, both old and new, and enable folks to rapidly put together systems that interact with the real world. Not very often you get to see a guy writing code for a safety PLC discussing an electrical interface with an engineer doing reinforcement learning over high-res pointclouds on a multi-nvidia card box, and they are working on the same project!\n\nAlso turns out that the experience I had making block diagrams of signal processing chains and communicating modules, or state machines I made for behavior as an EE might map pretty nicely to mechanisms I'm learning about in the CS world if I call them FRP, or Actor systems, or state charts. And who doesn't love a graphical editor, whether it be for schematics or a distributed system :slightly_smiling_face: \n\nAnyways, I'm in love with the creativity that is out there, and how many other folks are also thinking about how we move coding beyond where it is now. It's often overwhelming for a dilettante like me :-) I'm excited to learn more about what's out there, and to personally up my CS chops and learn some more theory. And of course very excited to share what I can with all of you as well!",

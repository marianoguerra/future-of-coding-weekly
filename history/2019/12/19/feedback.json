At the same time I have reservations. Formal type systems teach me how to program. They establish and enforce expectations for how any piece of code will work; what is and isn’t possible. They form vocabularies around which people communicate, write documentation, and coordinate their efforts. They ask me to think clearly about what I’m trying to accomplish, because sometimes I have enough information to figure it out, I’m just being lazy.\nIf the best you have are patterns, you’ll need at least a very strong, didactic standard library that you’ve put a lot of real-world experience and careful consideration into.\nHow much any of this matters depends on what kind of things people will be building with it; their scope, longevity, sociality. We’re starting with a single, narrowly scoped application we have full control over, evolving Datalog from a database to a programming layer as needs and the resources to meet them arise. I do hope to expose that layer to users gradually, probably by reifying very specific patterns (e.g. how to build a state machine in Datalog) in the programming environment.",

At the same time I have reservations. Formal type systems teach me how to program. They establish and enforce expectations for how any piece of code will work; what is and isn’t possible. They form vocabularies around which people communicate, write documentation, and coordinate their efforts. They ask me to think clearly about what I’m trying to accomplish, because sometimes I have enough information to figure it out, I’m just being lazy.\nIf the best you have are patterns, you’ll need at least a very strong, didactic standard library that you’ve put a lot of real-world experience and careful consideration into.\nHow much any of this matters depends on what kind of things people will be building with it; their scope, longevity, sociality. We’re starting with a single, narrowly scoped application we have full control over, evolving Datalog from a database to a programming layer as needs and the resources to meet them arise. I do hope to expose that layer to users gradually, probably by reifying very specific patterns (e.g. how to build a state machine in Datalog) in the programming environment."

If the type system is simple, tractable and easy to understand (eg, if it is simple enough to support the principal type property), then it isn't powerful enough. You can't abstract over an arbitrary expression, pull out variables and make them into function parameters. If you try to make the type system powerful enough, then you get something like Haskell, where 99% of the complexity of the language is in understanding the type system (including the vast array of GHC type system extensions that are required by various libraries). Your type system evolves to have \"shadow domains\" (<http:\/\/gbracha.blogspot.com\/2014\/09\/a-domain-of-shadows.html|gbracha.blogspot.com\/2014\/09\/a-domain-of-shadows.html>) where all of the features of the regular language are duplicated in the type system. For example, you have regular integers, and then you have type-level integers, where arithmetic operations are performed by the type system.\n\nI know that some people want all that complexity, because the end goal is dependent types and program verification. For the end user programming that interests me, strong typing is a disease that leads to runaway language complexity. Dynamic typing is the cure.",

If the type system is simple, tractable and easy to understand (eg, if it is simple enough to support the principal type property), then it isn't powerful enough. You can't abstract over an arbitrary expression, pull out variables and make them into function parameters. If you try to make the type system powerful enough, then you get something like Haskell, where 99% of the complexity of the language is in understanding the type system (including the vast array of GHC type system extensions that are required by various libraries). Your type system evolves to have \"shadow domains\" ("

For example, you have regular integers, and then you have type-level integers, where arithmetic operations are performed by the type system.\n\nI know that some people want all that complexity, because the end goal is dependent types and program verification. For the end user programming that interests me, strong typing is a disease that leads to runaway language complexity. Dynamic typing is the cure."

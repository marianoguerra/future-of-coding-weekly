Earlier we had a discussion on the negative sides of FP and one point was something like “OO preserves identity, FP does not” <@U8A5MS6R1>. The point is that you might get rid of shared mutable state but then to “preserve identity” you have to make it up “by hand”.\n\nNo matter what, if there are 2 independent pieces of code (like objects) which both use the same piece of information (the same identity), then there must be some kind of “syncronization” which prevents the system to work on corrupt data (without sync).\n\nSure, one option is using references to the same memory address, but then the two objects are not really independent but coupled. If they are truly independent then the syncronization of “their common state” must be embedded in their communication (protocol).\n\nThe “protocol between communicating objects”\/“mechanisms of the system” must ensure the sequences of events are valid  between all objects. My idea is to define both `valid` and `invalid` sequences of messages in the system so we can check out if some sequence (pattern) is left out, because in theory we are able to generate all the different kinds of sequences - expressing them with patterns. This really seems like connecting state machines, but still I did not find a well-known project which uses something like that. My closest findings are `xstate`  library (Typescript) and some SAT solvers coming from the CTL branch of Temporary Logic.",

                "text": "In economics, an externality is the cost or benefit that affects a party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit. Externalities often occur when a product or service's price equilibrium cannot reflect the true costs and benefits of that product or service. This causes the externality competitive equilibrium to not be a Pareto optimality.\nExternalities can be either positive or negative. Governments and institutions often take actions to internalize externalities, thus market-priced transactions can incorporate all the benefits and costs associated with transactions between economic agents. The most common way this is done is by imposing taxes on the producers of this externality. This is usually done similar to a quote where there is no tax imposed and then once the externality reaches a certain point there is a very high tax imposed. However, since regulators do not always have all the information on the externality it can be difficult to impose the right tax. Once the externality is internalized through imposing a tax the competitive equilibrium is now Pareto optimal.\nFor example, manufacturing activities that cause air pollution impose health and clean-up costs on the whole society, whereas the neighbors of individuals who choose to fire-proof their homes may benefit from a reduced risk of a fire spreading to their own houses. If external costs exist, such as pollution, the producer may choose to produce more of the product than would be produced if the producer were required to pay all associated environmental costs. Because responsibility or consequence for self-directed action lies partly outside the self, an element of externalization is involved. If there are external benefits, such as in public safety, less of the good may be produced than would be the case if the producer were to receive payment for the external benefits to others.  For the purpose of these statements, overall cost and benefit to society is defined as the sum of the imputed monetary value of benefits and costs to all parties involved.",

                "text": "People are alive -- they behave and respond.  Creations within the computer can also live, behave, and respond... if they are allowed to.  The message of this talk is that computer-based art tools should embrace both forms of life -- artists behaving through real-time performance, and art behaving through real-time simulation.  Everything we draw should be alive by default.\n\nPart 1 talks about the potential of the computer as a new visual art medium.  I show a collaboration between art and artist, with the art behaving through simulation, the artist behaving through performance, and the two of them working together, responding to each other.\n\nPart 2 demonstrates a tool for \"programming\" how art should behave and respond.  The artist directly manipulates art objects on the canvas, the way that visual art has always been created since the time of cave paintings.  The tool is based around direct, geometric construction rather than indirect, algebraic \"code\".\n\nPart 3 is a short performance.  \n\nThis talk was originally presented to SF SIGGRAPH on May 16 2012, and was recorded at the Exploratorium on November 27 2012.\n\n",

A City Is Not A Tree is unambiguously opposed to this kind of structure and separation. Quote: \"Only in the artificial-tree conception of the city are their natural, proper and necessary overlaps destroyed.\" This sentence is particularly relevant: \"Another favourite concept of the CIAM theorists and others is the separation of recreation from everything else.\"\n\nNote: CIAM = Congres Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne. From the Wikipedia article: \"CIAM proposed that the social problems faced by cities could be resolved by strict functional segregation\".\n\nAs for symmetry, Alexander says the following when criticizing the OP style of urban design: \"In simplicity of structure the tree is comparable to the compulsive desire for neatness and order that insists the candlesticks on a mantelpiece be perfectly straight and perfectly symmetrical about the centre.\"\n\nAs for \"judging cities from an aerial photograph\", I understand the first section of City Is Not A Tree as saying that if you design an urban area so that it looks beautiful and symmetrical from an aerial view, then you are prioritizing the aerial view over the needs of the human inhabitants who live in the city.\n\nIn general, I understand Alexander as proposing \"human centred design\" as an alternative to CIAM theory and modernist architecture, of which Old Man River is a pretty blatant example. \"Monument\" is my own word, it's not from Alexander. It's interesting that you don't see Old Man River as a monument. To me, it looks like Bucky Fuller wants to recreate the great pyramid of Cheops: a huge, unitary megastructure: timeless, eternal, unchanging. If built, it would be a monument to him and his ideas. Demolishing it would be politically difficult due to the vast cost of the building and its monumental nature. \"Natural\", \"organic\" cities (terms that Alexander uses) consist of many different buildings, and you can rezone areas and replace buildings as the city evolves and needs change. Old Man River is an artificial city of 125,000 that is designed to make this kind of evolution impossible. The residential, commercial and recreational zones are immutable.\n\nSo I'm pretty confident that Alexander wouldn't approve of OP. Your question was \"what would Alexander think?\". So I'm not objecting to OP, I am trying to view OP from Alexander's perspective.",

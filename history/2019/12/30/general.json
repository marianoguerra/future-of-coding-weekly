        "text": "All this, and your hope for the discussion to move towards learning, make me think of a personnal example about fun in progressively use\/learn a tool. It is about Vue.js.\n\nI have started to use it because a girl I know, when asked for Vue drawbacks answered me she can't find any. So I decided to give Vue a try. I first started to read its documentation which was very pleasant, there is a french translation, is very clear and reads like a novel. Things are introduced progressively with the right timing.\n\nAnd developping with it can also be very progressive. You don't have to have a global vision of everything to start creating nice things. I even started with an plain old index.html file. When you feel it, you introduce other concepts and everything fit nicely.\n\nSo my experience in learning and creating with Vue is really fun. And I am pretty sure that the fun will continue with the incomming new composition API (I can't wait to start using it :-) ).\n\nAnd all this is not by accident. The community (and first of all Evan You) is very very commited in making the developpers and learners experience very smooth and progressive. They try a lot to remove any accidental complexity.\n\nFor me, Vue is definetly a very inspiring example for building fun and engaging tools.",

I'm going to proceed assuming good faith. If anyone uploads way too many videos or otherwise abuses the audience, we'll alter course accordingly.\n• The moment we hit 100 subscribers, I'll give the channel a nicer URL. (Sigh)",

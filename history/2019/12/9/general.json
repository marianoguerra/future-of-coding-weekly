        "text": "<@UF89Z7SRF> At this point I'm more curious about your style of reasoning. As far as I can see, you haven't attempted to explain what abstraction means to you in abstract terms. Instead you always turn to examples and have posted quite a few of them here. Nothing wrong with that, in fact they would all be super helpful to illustrate an abstract description.\n\nBy arguing like that, somewhat ironically, you leave out the crucial step of generalizing what the concept means to you and leave it to us to interpret your examples to find the commonalities ourselves.\n\nI've tried, and I am unfortunately not able to come to the conclusions you do using your examples. I tried to acknowledge that in my explanation of how I interpret _abstraction_ by offering _transformation_ as a more generic concept that I believe fits all your examples and also my understanding of _abstraction_ itself, trying to create some common ground.\n\nNow on the other hand, I so far have only offered my abstract explanation and no specific examples. So let me try that and meet you where you are:\n\nTake an `apple` and a `banana`. In our (hopefully shared) English folk taxonomy, we would classify both as `fruit`. We're generalizing, ignoring some of the properties `apple`s and `banana`s have.\nOr take `green` and `yellow`. Both `color`s. Same process. That's what I call `abstraction`.\n\nBased on your examples I feel like you come into this claiming \"yellow is an abstraction of banana\".\n\nYou jump between domains. And that's interesting. I don't really understand it. Also, it's not obviously wrong! It's somewhat clever because, yes, bananas are usually yellow, and just looking at the color of bananas feels very similar to the process I described above.\n\nStill I come to the conclusion to reject it as a form of `abstraction` and point out the requirement to stay within the same domain.\nHere's why:\n\nWhen we agree that an `apple` is a `fruit`, we gain a powerful tool as part of our language that allows us to communicate more efficiently. It's not just introducing a new name for something. It's more than that. We can jump between the levels of abstraction as we see fit and say \"`fruit`s are healthy\" and don't have to list all the individual fruits. At the same time we can walk into a supermarket and say \"an `apple`, please\" and get exactly the fruit we want.\n\n(From my understanding of Lakoff, there are kinesthetic image schemas _container_ and _whole-part_ at play here, and we use metaphorical structure to add additional meaning to the relationship between `apple` and `fruit`.)\n\nWhat do we get if we accept the same relation between `banana` and `yellow`?\n\nI can't see the same benefits there and to me it's mostly confusing, even though I can see why it appears similar.\n\nThat's why I'd like to keep `abstraction` for the concept with these specific benefits, and leave `transformation` or `mapping` for the concept without. It feels like we have good words for all these things already, and watering down `abstraction` only makes it harder for us to communicate.",

I tried to acknowledge that in my explanation of how I interpret _abstraction_ by offering _transformation_ as a more generic concept that I believe fits all your examples and also my understanding of _abstraction_ itself, trying to create some common ground.\n\nNow on the other hand, I so far have only offered my abstract explanation and no specific examples. So let me try that and meet you where you are:\n\nTake an `apple` and a `banana`. In our (hopefully shared) English folk taxonomy, we would classify both as `fruit`. We're generalizing, ignoring some of the properties `apple`s and `banana`s have.\nOr take `green` and `yellow`. Both `color`s. Same process. That's what I call `abstraction`.\n\nBased on your examples I feel like you come into this claiming \"yellow is an abstraction of banana\".\n\nYou jump between domains. And that's interesting. I don't really understand it. Also, it's not obviously wrong! It's somewhat clever because, yes, bananas are usually yellow, and just looking at the color of bananas feels very similar to the process I described above.\n\nStill I come to the conclusion to reject it as a form of `abstraction` and point out the requirement to stay within the same domain.\nHere's why:\n\nWhen we agree that an `apple` is a `fruit`, we gain a powerful tool as part of our language that allows us to communicate more efficiently. It's not just introducing a new name for something. It's more than that. We can jump between the levels of abstraction as we see fit and say \"`fruit`s are healthy\" and don't have to list all the individual fruits. At the same time we can walk into a supermarket and say \"an `apple`, please\" and get exactly the fruit we want.\n\n(From my understanding of Lakoff, there are kinesthetic image schemas _container_ and _whole-part_ at play here, and we use metaphorical structure to add additional meaning to the relationship between `apple` and `fruit`.)\n\nWhat do we get if we accept the same relation between `banana` and `yellow`?\n\nI can't see the same benefits there and to me it's mostly confusing, even though I can see why it appears similar.\n\nThat's why I'd like to keep `abstraction` for the concept with these specific benefits, and leave `transformation` or `mapping` for the concept without. It feels like we have good words for all these things already, and watering down `abstraction` only makes it harder for us to communicate."

I don’t think the category “yellow” is structured the same way the category “fruits” is (Lakoff and other linguists don’t seem to either).\n\nThere is indeed lots of research about colors as categories in language, and studies in that area are used as empiric evidence that mental categories are not objective, transcendental, and definable without taking into account the perceiving being. See _George Lakoff, Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things_ for reference.\n\nIndependent from how we structure our mental categories, let me try to address the domain requirement this way:\n\nIf we want to ensure mutual understanding, it isn’t sufficient to just define a word, but also the domain we’re operating in.\n\nI can totally see a category “yellow” that means exactly what <@UJN1TAYEQ> defines it as. It’s just not the same category as “yellow” we more intuitively turn to as part of our folk taxonomy of colors.",

Bananas contain naturally occurring radioactive isotopes, particularly potassium-40 (40K), one of several naturally-occurring isotopes of potassium. One BED is often correlated to 10-7 sievert (0.1 μSv); however, in practice, this dose is not cumulative, as the principal radioactive component is excreted to maintain metabolic equilibrium. The BED is only meant to inform the public about the existence of very low levels of natural radioactivity within a natural food and is not a formally adopted dose measurement.",

He wrote it to be comprehensive, which doesn't necessarily contribute to the accessibility of the work.\n\nAs they say: all models are wrong, but some are useful.\n\nI find Experientialism extremely useful. Integrating the experiencing individual into the model of reasoning seems like a pretty good idea to me and a good step towards a more humane foundation we want to build our world on.

He wrote it to be comprehensive, which doesn't necessarily contribute to the accessibility of the work.\n\nAs they say: all models are wrong, but some are useful.\n\nI find Experientialism extremely useful. Integrating the experiencing individual into the model of reasoning seems like a pretty good idea to me and a good step towards a more humane foundation we want to build our world on.

In my encounters with anyone doing a trade or craft (whether plumbing, electrical, framing, carpentry, leatherwork, weaving, etc) the people who seem to genuinely care about doing good work themselves _always_ also care about identifying good (and bad) work around them.

The first is actually about impressing peers, because peers are also the end users so they are equivalent, but the things that impress programmers are not the same things that impress a current \"end user\", you may not impress a peer building a tool for end users using javascript and html, but end users may find it super useful."

But also one who loses sight of the ultimate purpose of his work will make things that can't be used. I do think it is possible to do the former without falling into the trap of the latter.\n\nFWIW, I've had to spend time in a few buildings that were probably designed to look good in architecture magazines, and I *hated* it. Those buildings were unusable objects; almost hostile.\n\nI've said before that I think the programming community often measures success in a way that's incompatible with making programming tools for end users. Programmers generally like and are impressed by \"puzzle-y\" systems (and are self-selected by the tendency of the community to be this way), and for people who don't operate that way, the same design decisions can feel hostile\/exclusionary.",

        "text": "So, I'm not an expert, nor can I make any claim to speak on behalf of the deeply under-represented, but there are some things I'd like to comment on in response to Al.\n\nA friend of mine, a woman who works as a programmer in SF and participates in her company's diversity efforts(as well as doing really cool coding for girls outreach as a volunteer!) explained it to me like this: basically, when a women is interviewing for a tech company and sees an office full of dudes, it instantly sets off red flags to her. Most of them have had bad experiences in these environments, and if they've been in the industry for a while, although it's entirely likely that they've accumulated the expertise to improve those conditions, they're just plain tired of putting in the emotional labor for a place like that. So they often make the totally logical choice to pass on such groups, and find places where they can better spend their energy thriving on their own terms.\n\nSo that is just one women's perspective in San Francisco, relayed through a dude's retelling, and barely scratches the surface of these issues.

Most of them have had bad experiences in these environments, and if they've been in the industry for a while, although it's entirely likely that they've accumulated the expertise to improve those conditions, they're just plain tired of putting in the emotional labor for a place like that. So they often make the totally logical choice to pass on such groups, and find places where they can better spend their energy thriving on their own terms.\n\nSo that is just one women's perspective in San Francisco, relayed through a dude's retelling, and barely scratches the surface of these issues.

They take traditional code pieces, wrap them in boxes, and draw S-curves between the boxes. There are no tools added that leverage the visual medium. So I'd say any visual language that advances the state of the art needs to do something more with visual communication. The Nodes folks I linked to above seem to be on the same page — they're giving much thought to deepening communication. (Paging <@UEG9ECNSU>). My project (Hest) is coming at the problem from the other side — it is an art tool, which imbues the visual primitives (the points and edges of 2d vectors or 3d polygons) with computational purpose.",

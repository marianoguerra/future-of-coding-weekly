It is the tricky part, and it must be a \"first class\" concern for those tools.\n\nEven if I didn't realized at that time, it was what I was after with my mixed text and box\/arrow programming tool.",

        "text": "&gt; more and more products are based on the promise to make our lives easier by using increasingly complex technologies with ever simpler interfaces\nI don’t know… have we really reached peak UX yet? I don’t think so. Good UX is still rare, and before I begin to worry that we take it too far I hope we are going to take it much further. Have you booked a flight recently? Bought an event ticket? Tried to figure out opening times of a restaurant? All these use cases could be much simpler and there’s lots of work to do.\n\nI’m also not sure if I really need to know what happens, if I push a button to order something. There are use cases where convenience is what it’s all about. You want all the complexity hidden. That’s the whole point. Ok, I’d want some transparency to be sure the service is legal, ethical, ecological, etc., but that’s doesn’t necessarily mean revealing how it works and honestly I think I’m part of a minority requesting even such things.\n\nI can see what he’s trying to say, and I’d love to see more tools that are not just hiding as much complexity as possible, giving people the means to understand technology where it is useful. This is limited to specific domains though and the article generalizes that too much for my taste. There will be people who want to learn a language and will embrace a well-designed tool that helps them with that. There will also be people who just want something translated and don’t care one bit about learning the language. We should have tools for both kinds of people. And we shouldn’t force the person looking for convenience to learn as we shouldn’t limit the person wanting to learn.\n\nThat said, these are some beautiful illustrations!",

There will be people who want to learn a language and will embrace a well-designed tool that helps them with that.

        "text": "<@UC2A2ARPT> Nice to hear a really honest answer, thanks! For me, after seeing thousands of companies say they will reinvent programming with their new tools or techniques I do not know what will work, but I have definitely seen patterns of what *won't work*:\n\n• *Closed source* - Sure, you can make money and do some great dev stuff (like some .net stuff or VB for the 1990s) but none of these revolutionized development. \n• *Core language not community owned* - So many people try to \"own\" the language as soon as they smell the money which forces them to make bad or short term decisions\n• *Thinking short term (ie: 5 years timespan which is typical startup timespan)* - The problem of reinventing programming is a problem that people have tried to solve, thousands, maybe 100s of thousands of times and there is a lot of overconfidence in the area, and just to learn what has been done before could take 5 - 10 years so as not to repeat the mistakes that those who tried it before made\nI guess as the community lead people will look to you for direction on this stuff, to provide roadmaps for categories of problems being solved, and what we have already tried, so that community members can get up to speed on targetting new areas of research instead of just going down the same blind alleys every time. This means setting up conferences, webinars for us all and stuff like that. Keeping the community going can be thankless hard work and is fun while it grows, the real test is when noone else cares :disappointed:\n\nAnyway, to answer your question about where I have been for the past 25 years, don't follow my example, as when I was in my early 20s and 30s I just wasted my time with trivial problems, thinking I would get rich quick from it. I hope the people in this community are nothing like I was when I was younger, and that people here really want to re-invent programming. I did try to join several different programming groups over the last 25 years, but the founders either found a way to sell stuff and then forgot about reinventing programming, or they gave up when they realised that things were going to be too hard and they couldn't find a way to make money, so money always got in the way. And I totally understand where they are coming from, I mean, why should someone waste time solving what may be an unsolvable problem when all their peers are getting rich!\n\nAnyway, as I said, I guess that I am the wrong person to know what will work as there is probably some 12 year old kid sitting somewhere who is inventing the future of programming and will do it in a weekend and surprise us all, and I am just talking as someone who has given up themselves and just copying something from the 1990s (VB6) as I have no better idea myself of how to solve the problem.\n\nAnyway, I guess based on your answer that you have done your homework on how people have tried to solve this problem by studying HCI, Bret Victor, etc, and that you have the right motivations to do this (not money) to have a good chance and making this community work long term, so I definitely support that! :)",

I hope the people in this community are nothing like I was when I was younger, and that people here really want to re-invent programming. I did try to join several different programming groups over the last 25 years, but the founders either found a way to sell stuff and then forgot about reinventing programming, or they gave up when they realised that things were going to be too hard and they couldn't find a way to make money, so money always got in the way. And I totally understand where they are coming from, I mean, why should someone waste time solving what may be an unsolvable problem when all their peers are getting rich!\n\nAnyway, as I said, I guess that I am the wrong person to know what will work as there is probably some 12 year old kid sitting somewhere who is inventing the future of programming and will do it in a weekend and surprise us all, and I am just talking as someone who has given up themselves and just copying something from the 1990s (VB6) as I have no better idea myself of how to solve the problem.\n\nAnyway, I guess based on your answer that you have done your homework on how people have tried to solve this problem by studying HCI, Bret Victor, etc, and that you have the right motivations to do this (not money) to have a good chance and making this community work long term, so I definitely support that! :)"

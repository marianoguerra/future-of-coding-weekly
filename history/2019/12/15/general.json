It is also full of connections, as anyone can discover (if they didn't know already) by doing a few perspective drawings and changing the viewing point - connected objects clearly must remain so . The folks at Silicon \"SuperPaint\" Beach Software took these two facts to heart in designing the centerpiece tools of Aldus's much-touted new drawing package, IntelliDraw ($200 discounted)",

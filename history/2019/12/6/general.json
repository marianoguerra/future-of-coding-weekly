His box and wire user interface for the programming is very similar to what Luna is doing, although Luna is trying to be able to switch back and forth between a syntax view and a node-and-wire view, which is an additional challenge that many of us are skeptical can be achieved before they use up all their capital. I can't imagine how many man-years Conway put into his program builder. Unfortunately his system hits a brick wall where there is a magical message block that handles the user input. It is a simple fact that manipulating graphical objects takes a fair amount of code and that responding to a range of gestures, while taking into account the time periods of those gestures, is a challenging task, and is not easily represented in some graphical way.",

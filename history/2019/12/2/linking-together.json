        "text": "K is an evolution of Iverson's APL. I was fortunate enough to speak with Iverson before he passed. He was a completely brilliant mathematician\/programmer, and it took him a long time to realize that his invented alphabet was a major hindrance. Coming from a math background, which exults in using greek letters which are a foreign alphabet to most us, he didn't realize the obstacle it created. The beauty of having a verb expressed in a single symbol is similar to the compression one gets out of Chinese, but to a learner, Chinese is well known to be the hardest language to learn (followed by Japanese, which is tough because it contains 2000 Chinese characters!). Anyway K doesn't solve the ease of learning and use problem, because you have to read it right to left, which is foreign to all normal people. We learn to read left to right, and the habit of reading right to left is so unnatural, that i fear that K will only be the choice of highly disciplined minds, and thus not going to be widely popular. However it is fantastically compact, and is forward progress in the APL lineage IMHO.",

He was a completely brilliant mathematician\/programmer, and it took him a long time to realize that his invented alphabet was a major hindrance. Coming from a math background, which exults in using greek letters which are a foreign alphabet to most us, he didn't realize the obstacle it created. The beauty of having a verb expressed in a single symbol is similar to the compression one gets out of Chinese, but to a learner, Chinese is well known to be the hardest language to learn (followed by Japanese, which is tough because it contains 2000 Chinese characters!). Anyway K doesn't solve the ease of learning and use problem, because you have to read it right to left, which is foreign to all normal people. We learn to read left to right, and the habit of reading right to left is so unnatural, that i fear that K will only be the choice of highly disciplined minds, and thus not going to be widely popular. However it is fantastically compact, and is forward progress in the APL lineage IMHO."

        "text": "We’ve discussed the complexity aspects here many times, however I’m somewhat intrigued by his take on open source:\n\n&gt;Whatever the causes, we have software and hardware systems that strive to be entirely open, yet time and again are closed ones that are more accessible in practice, that drive social revolutions. Linux didn't change the desktop, nor the way software is made. \n\nI’ve always felt weird about open source, which is taken for granted as a good thing by many because of its openness. But it feels messy and poorly designed in most cases, because only few open source projects have strong opinions and willingness to leave out things (which I think is a core part of good design \/ managing complexity). The open source projects that do are either rather insignificant code dumps from single individuals or projects backed by massive companies who’ve imprinted their strategy on them. \n\n&gt;And ironically, probably by utter coincidence, but ironically indeed, all the new power brokers of this era, the Facebooks and Amazons, the Googles and Twitters and so on, fully embrace opensource stacks, hundreds of millions lines of codes powering the AIs, the networks of today. \n&gt;The new IBMs do know very well that lines of code are for the most part worthless, but people and communities aren't, so it's a no brainer to opensource more if in change one gets more people involved in a project, and more engineers hired...\n\nIt almost feels like there is a inherent systemic force that makes open source projects absorb complexity and therefore _less_ valuable in the eyes of big corporations who seem to be more interested in their appeal to an audience that attracts talent and free or at least cheap labor. If they really cared (and for those parts of the code they really do), they’d properly hire engineers instead.\n\n&gt;Perhaps we didn't truly graduate from our a-social tendencies, perhaps we're true to form in thinking that the machine and technology are more interesting than people, and groups, and culture...\n\nThis is also a sentence packed with insight worth a whole discussion on its own. Are we really contributing anything valuable if we all individually dump our code on GitHub? And if we all do just this with our own projects instead of looking how we can contribute to other people’s projects?",

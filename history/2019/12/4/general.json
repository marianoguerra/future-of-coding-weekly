        "text": "Abstraction is fundamentally about removing detail. When you abstract, you make a choice what to keep and what to get rid of. You decide to ignore some details that you deem unimportant and you highlight those that you think are important. That is what design is about.\n\nMaybe calling it “invisible interface” is too limiting or too extreme, although sometimes that might be  a good design. However, always being able to jump between the layers of abstraction and to merely consider abstraction as transformation and not getting rid of anything really does seem extreme either, even though it might also be good design in certain cases.\n\nIn our field I sense a strong aversion to giving up control (aka removing things). Our deep understanding of technology enables us to deal with a much higher amount of complexity than people untrained in our field, who might get overwhelmed much easier than we would. That gets in the way when we try to design stuff for them like interfaces or experiences.\n\nI think this also lies at the core of why we can’t leave things like human-readable data formats, text editors, or command line terminals behind — it just gives us so much control we’re not willing to give up. Meanwhile, regular people do just fine without those.",

                "text": "Declarative assembly of web applications from predefined concepts De Rosso et al., Onward! 2019\nI chose this paper to challenge my own thinking. I&rsquo;m not really a fan of low-code \/ no-code \/ just drag-and-drop-from-our-catalogue forms of application development. My fear is that all too often it&rsquo;s like jumping on a motorbike and tearing off at great speed (rapid initial progress), only to ride around a bend and find a brick wall across the road in front of you. That doesn&rsquo;t normally end well. I&rsquo;ve seen enough generations of CASE (remember that acronym?), component-based software development, reusable software catalogues etc. to develop a healthy scepticism: lowest-common denominators, awkward or missing round-tripping behaviour, terrible debugging experiences, catalogues full of junk components, inability to accommodate custom behaviours not foreseen by the framework\/component developers, limited reuse opportunities in practice compared to theory, and so on.\nThe thing is, on one level I know that I&rsquo;m wrong. To start with, there&rsquo;s Grady Booch&rsquo;s observation that &ldquo;the whole history of computer science is one of ever rising levels of abstraction&rdquo; 1. Then there&rsquo;s the changing demographic of software building. Heather Miller recently gave a great presentation on this topic, &lsquo;The times they are a changin&rsquo;&lsquo;. To quote from her presentation:\nThere&rsquo;s a tidal wave of newcomers entering our profession, and it&rsquo;s not going to slow down. It&rsquo;s going to pick up speed. &ndash; Heather Miller.\nWe&rsquo;re also doing a pretty good job at reuse, and messy catalogues full of junk components don&rsquo;t actually seem to be a problem in practice, so long as the &lsquo;good stuff&rsquo; is readily identifiable (think package managers \/ &lsquo;there&rsquo;s a gem for that&rsquo;). Another data point from Miller&rsquo;s presentation: in 2018 57-70% of the average software project comprises open source components, and that fraction is rising fast. &ldquo;We largely glue together open source components now (we didn&rsquo;t do this as much, not even like 3 years ago).&rdquo;\nAs a final data point, low-code companies have been able to build sizeable businesses, e.g. Appian valued at $2.89B as I write, and Mendix acquired by Siemens for $700M in 2018.\nSo, it&rsquo;s important on a number of levels to keep pushing on rising the level of abstraction. For me, the winning hand will have to combine both technical and social frameworks &ndash; supporting, encouraging, and growing a healthy ecosystem is a necessary ingredient of success here.\nThe paper!\nOnto the paper! Let&rsquo;s find out what De Rosso et al, have to say about the &lsquo;Declarative assembly of web applications from predefined concepts.&rsquo;\nA new approach to web application development is presented, in which an application is constructed by configuring and composing concepts drawn from a catalog developed by experts.\nThe platform (framework) for building these applications is called D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu, and the unit of abstraction in D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu is a Concept. Concepts are more closely aligned with application features than with e.g. class-level components. Examples are commenting, scoring, and so on. Concepts are embodied as microservices:\nA D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu application is a set of concept instances that run in parallel. Each instance is a full stack service in its own right, with front-end GUI components, a back-end server and data storage, and all the code necessary to coordinate them. By default these services run entirely independently of one another, in complete isolation.\nI&rsquo;ve called them microservices here, but the authors are at pains to point out that concepts are more fine-grained that traditional plug-ins or microservices.\nAbstractly, a concept instance is a state machine that changes state only in response to actions issued by the user through the front-end.\nA bit like actors-with-front-ends then? And surely we&rsquo;d want to generalise to event sourcing patterns where not all events have to originate in a user action?\nThe integration of two or more concepts is achieved by defining a common identifier to bind the distinct views. That&rsquo;s going to present challenges with atomic changes across concepts. The more fine-grained your ~components~ concepts are, the more that matters. The authors include a transaction mechanism, but it&rsquo;s not clear to me how it coordinates updates across the independent concept backends.\nWhat&rsquo;s new in this work is what the parts are &mdash; full-stack implementations of concepts &mdash; and how they are put together &mdash; by declarative synchronization.\nHere&rsquo;s an example configuration file for a Hacker News clone called Slacker News.\n\nAlongside pre-defined concepts, an application may include components of its own. Authoring application components involves the creation of a web component using a templating language for property binding. Application components may in turn be composed of other application components and concepts.\n\nA key distinction between application components and concepts is that application components are front-end only, all back-end functionality is pushed to concepts. (Make those concept instances shared across apps, and it starts to look a lot like a back-end-as-a-service play&hellip;).\nThe special tx application component is used to wrap concept actions (across concepts) in a transaction. When every concept is its own independent full-stack implementation, we&rsquo;re going to need each concept back-end to be able to act as a resource manager in a distributed transaction for this to work? The paper is silent on this issue.\nD&eacute;j&agrave; Vu in action\nThere&rsquo;s a bit more detail about the D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu programming model in the paper, but not much. The prototype implementation is built in TypeScript, Angular, and Node.js, and includes a concept library with the following concepts:\n\nThere are both monolith (all concept backends in a single Node.js app?) and microservice based backends. So I guess we should infer that concepts are logically independent, but can be physically deployed in the same app and fate-sharing.\nTo test building applications using D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu, the authors attempted to reproduce 12 student applications originally created as part of a Fall&rsquo;16 undergraduate course.\n\nThe median number of concept types used to implement the apps was 6, with a median of 9 concept instances (some apps use multiple instances of a concept).\n\nThe original projects each represented 200-400 person-hours of work. I was looking for some data to see how much effort it took to rebuild these projects with D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu, but couldn&rsquo;t find it in the paper. Instead the main evaluation results seem to focus on the fact that it was possible.\nThe old chestnut of behaviour not foreseen by the framework \/ component developer raises its head, with a classic framework developer response too!\nWe noticed that it becomes evident when some project deviates from what you&rsquo;d expect the normal behavior of certain functionality to be&hellip; it raises an interesting research question &mdash; which we have yet to explore &mdash; about whether deviations from the norm (where &ldquo;norm&rdquo; is functionality that can be built by combining concepts D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu-style) represent design flaws in the application or the invention of a novel concept.\nYep, you read that right. If the thing you&rsquo;re trying to build doesn&rsquo;t fit with our framework, you probably have a design flaw!\nAnother classic question concerns the curation and evolution of the concept catalog. Is this an open repository that will gradually fill up with noise, or a carefully curated catalog &mdash; in which case who curates it and how does this scale?\nTo avoid overlapping functionality between concepts, we only add a new co…",

Things have improved, however: Pharo for example supports Unicode and uses images as temporary workspaces rather than for long-term system evolution. Modern Pharo code lives in git repositories. And there is support for immutable objects, which are however still quite rare. ‘true become: false’ still produces a spectacular crash, but that isn’t really an issue in practice.\nEverything else being equal, I’d also prefer pure functional languages, but everything else is not equal. Smalltalk makes it much easier to understand your system, which is worth a lot as well.",

So this part doesn't make sense.\nLive programming doesn't typically have inputs. Status quo programming is entirely concerned with inputs. Functions often return dramatically different results depending on their inputs. If a live-programming system had inputs, and if it changed dramatically based on its inputs, it would take a long time to get a sense for how a given change to the code modified its behavior. For example, there may be broad swathes of inputs that have no visible difference in output for some code change (especially if it's guarded by some predicate). This seems like a big contrast between the two categories.\n\nDoes that help? If not I'll throw in the towel..",

Functions often return dramatically different results depending on their inputs. If a live-programming system had inputs, and if it changed dramatically based on its inputs, it would take a long time to get a sense for how a given change to the code modified its behavior. For example, there may be broad swathes of inputs that have no visible difference in output for some code change (especially if it's guarded by some predicate). This seems like a big contrast between the two categories.\n\nDoes that help? If not I'll throw in the towel.."

It was a big hit in its day (1995), and still runs even in Windows 10. It used a time travel feature for training, where it could narrate how to use the product while moving the mouse like a ghost. It was designed to be a sequel to KidPix  and had art from the incomparable pixel artist Mark Ferrari who did Loom, Monkey Island, and most recently Thimbleweek Park.   <https:\/\/www.magicmouse.com\/downloads\/Flying%20Colors%20211D.zip>\n\nBut to reinforce my point, the reason pixel-pushing programs work so well via direct manipulation interfaces, is that pixels in a bitmap add together easily. If you aren't blending, new pixels simply replace the old ones. You can't break the image by adding new pixels. At all times it functions as an image, while in general software, you add some new code and can easily break the whole product.",

It was a big hit in its day (1995), and still runs even in Windows 10. It used a time travel feature for training, where it could narrate how to use the product while moving the mouse like a ghost. It was designed to be a sequel to KidPix  and had art from the incomparable pixel artist Mark Ferrari who did Loom, Monkey Island, and most recently Thimbleweek Park.   "

If you aren't blending, new pixels simply replace the old ones. You can't break the image by adding new pixels. At all times it functions as an image, while in general software, you add some new code and can easily break the whole product."

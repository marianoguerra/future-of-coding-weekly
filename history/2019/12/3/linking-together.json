        "text": "&gt; the idea of having adverbs was really interesting to me\n\"verb\" and \"adverb\" are just non-standard terminology for standard concepts. In functional programming, a verb is a function, and an adverb is a combinator (a function that takes a function as an argument, and returns another function as a result. For example, in functional languages, \"map\" is a combinator, which is exactly equivalent to the \"each\" adverb in APL.\n\nBut if you look at the actual syntax of APL (or K), you see something interesting, which might relate to natural language. I don't think that left-to-right vs right-to-left evaluation order is a big deal. Almost every language has right-associative infix operators, APL just has more of them. What I find more interesting is that identifiers and operator symbols are treated the same way: they can be interpreted either as infix operators, or as arguments to an adverb. I don't see that in any other language family. APL classifies each named object as a noun, verb or adverb, and that classification affects how expressions are parsed. An adverb takes one or two verbs as arguments, and a verb takes one or two nouns as arguments. And that's interesting.",

                                "text": "\"verb\" and \"adverb\" are just non-standard terminology for standard concepts. In functional programming, a verb is a function, and an adverb is a combinator (a function that takes a function as an argument, and returns another function as a result. For example, in functional languages, \"map\" is a combinator, which is exactly equivalent to the \"each\" adverb in APL.\n\nBut if you look at the actual syntax of APL (or K), you see something interesting, which might relate to natural language. I don't think that left-to-right vs right-to-left evaluation order is a big deal. Almost every language has right-associative infix operators, APL just has more of them. What I find more interesting is that identifiers and operator symbols are treated the same way: they can be interpreted either as infix operators, or as arguments to an adverb. I don't see that in any other language family. APL classifies each named object as a noun, verb or adverb, and that classification affects how expressions are parsed. An adverb takes one or two verbs as arguments, and a verb takes one or two nouns as arguments. And that's interesting."

A single expression can be spread over many lines. Reading such programs bottom-to-top and right-to-left is a problem, so I introduced left-to-right function call notation, which in my case looks like this:\n"
                            }
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "rich_text_preformatted",
                        "elements": [
                            {
                                "type": "text",
                                "text": "x >> f >> g >> h    is the same as    h(g(f(x))"
                            }
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "rich_text_section",
                        "elements": [
                            {
                                "type": "text",
                                "text": "In practice, programs written in this style feel just like pipelines in the Unix shell. It's nice. Many other functional languages also have a left-to-right pipeline operator."
                            }
                        ]
                    }

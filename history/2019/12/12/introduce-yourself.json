Got our own code engine to try to make it easier for beginners to learn languages like Python, JavaScript, C++, etc. with friendly error messages, control over code execution, full interpreter\/game engine integration, a (disabled) time travel debugger, etc. Love hearing about ideas for how to make learning coding more intuitive."

One simple trick that will make programming language research significantly more interesting is to think about programs not as expressions, but as a result of a sequence of interactions that create it. This includes usual things such as writing code and refactoring, but if we also include, say, running a part of the program, we become capable of saying many more interesting things and building new powerful programming tools.",

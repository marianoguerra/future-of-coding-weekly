        "text": "<@UL3FQ4PHB> Thanks for the links!   I took a quick look at \"Information-gain computation\"; very cool!  I didn't really follow it deeply but I worried that the adaptive mechanism seemed quite aggressive -- and thus perhaps liable to be misled by early data on more complex examples.  Is that impossible for some reason?  It made me wish for a comparison to Prolog-with-random-search-order (something like the suggestion in <https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/45681109\/randomizing-priority-in-prolog-predicates> ).  It seems like such a 'Randolog' would do almost as well as adaptive evaluation on the cases you show, but wouldn't get faked out by deceptive computations.",

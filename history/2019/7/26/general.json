But the existing successful cases of that, to me, appear to be the cases where programmers made tools that required non-programmers to learn a freshly-invented skill — a skill that ends up being less foreign than programming, a skill designed to be similar to their existing skillset, but an all new skill nonetheless.\n\nWhat's so interesting about the \"designer to developer handoff\" problem is that for some reason it has been extraordinarily resistant to creating a new specialized tool that can output something useable. E.g., I believe all the examples you listed \"character modeler, rigger, texture artist, pose-to-pose animator, particle\/effects artist\" output something that doesn't then need to be translated by a developer? I can't figure out what's unique about software interfaces that makes it different from these other use case.

Prior to those tools existing, and those skills\/roles being created, programmers and artists needed to collaborate intimately on every piece of the art. As these tools\/skills were created (one at a time, and not very good at first), that need for total attention from both sides was lessened gradually.\n\nThere was a time, when memory and other performance constraints were very strict, that video game artists would frequently create works that were too rich and detailed to run efficiently, and programmers would need to either collaborate with them to find art production processes that produced a more efficient result, or (sometimes) edit the output from those tools themselves. Eventually these perf-friendly practices became common, and the hardware improved, and the amount of constant, intimate interaction between programmers and artists tapered off.\n\nI think web designers and developers are going through a similar progression. It used to be common that a \"web designer\" would produce a PSD with slices — a format that was basically opaque to the technology of the web. Now, web designers are fluent in SVG and CSS. With tools like Greensock and Bodymovin, web designers are able to produce animations that can run in the browser without much, or any, direct help from a programmer.\n\nRight now, we're going through a phase where we're collectively putting a lot of stock in the idea of reusable components, and we're going through the fits and starts of making tools that designers can use to build components. We had the template language phase, and the Polymer\/X-tags phase, and the React-style components phase — each one less and less programmer centric and more amenable to designers. We're getting ever closer to something that it'd be worth building GUI around, which (I think) is the tipping point. If there's a successor to React Components in this lineage, I would not be at all surprised to see it become the standard that tools like WebFlow embrace, at which point we'll be in \"3d tools in the mid-late 1990s\" territory — good enough that artists no longer need to understand what's happening under the hood, but not quite to the point that programmers are free from having to worry about what the artists end up making. But we'll get there.",

        "text": "<@UC2A2ARPT> Thanks for the great response. Any thoughts on why 3D tools were able to solve this problem in the 1990's but user interfaces have struggled for so long? E.g., Interface Builder being from 1988 is 30 years of working on this problem.\n\nI know you're hinting at it, that a lot of groundwork needed to be laid first. But that still leaves the question: Why do interfaces in particular require so much groundwork? E.g., we didn't need as much groundwork for 3D modeling, bitmap\/vector editors , DAWs, NLEs, or spreadsheets. What makes interfaces uniquely difficult?",

Those industries are huge, and the role these tools play is also huge. 3D graphics is fiendishly difficult, especially the realtime stuff. The tools were an absolute necessity.\n\nDemonstrably, we've been able to have the modern software industry without similar tools. GUIs are tricky, but not that tricky by comparison. We've been able to make do with not-great tools, tolerating a bit of bugginess here and there, a bit of lost productivity spent doing things the slow way.\n\nA programmer can make a bad-but-functional GUI on their own. A web designer can learn a bit of JQuery or Flash or CSS or what have you and cobble something together that mostly works. Typical programmers can't make 3d art that's more sophisticated than a stick figure (without tools that do most of the work), and typical artists have exactly as much affinity for linear algebra (without tools that do most of the work).",

Your point still stands but I'd tweak it a bit: What just isn't that hard is for developers to implement a designer's user interface. That's just really not that difficult, so why not have the developer just do it?\n\nOne area in user interface design that I can say from experience is an order of magnitude more difficult than implementing a static UI design is implementing custom animations created by designers. So if this hypothesis is true, tools that can output usable animations that don't require developer translation should improve quickly.",

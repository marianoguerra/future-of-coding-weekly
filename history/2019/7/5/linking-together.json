I could be wrong here but I think whole of category theory as a study of morphisms over topological entities has the same layered graph idea as the it's central unifying metaphor. I am thinking more about things like perceptrons of Minsky (which is again a neural network ~ graph), or Ulf Grenander like pattern generators, may be even composing cellular automata together to build and reason about complex systems.",

Check out those pattern generators by Grenander. You Hest is also a very welcome change in the way we directly manipulate behaviour on screen. Really great job on building something like that.\n\nNow that image is from a paper I stumbled on about managing complexity called \"Systems Theoretic Techniques for Modeling, Control and Decision Support in Complex Dynamic Systems\" It has got more cool images: <https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1008.0775.pdf> And I think he does indeed think of the predominant model as another graph instead of being a tree with cross references.\n\nMy only gripe with such a model is that once you bring in time to track the topological changes, it quickly has a chance to devolve into a messy hairball that then displays multiple conformations over time, to which the only sane approach is to divide it into domains of interest and then inspect the pieces one by one.\n\nI am thinking out loud what other units of composition might be out there to build systems up from scratch and what kind of trade offs they might have.",

On Alexander's death, his empire did not crumble to dust, but fragmented into some of the major subsystems that had composed it. If one would be Alexander, one should be born into a world where large stable political systems already exist. Where this condition was not fulfilled, as on the Scythian and Indian frontiers, Alexander found empire building a slippery business. So too, T. E. Lawrence's organizing of the Arabian revolt against the Turks was limited by the character of his largest stable building blocks, the separate, suspicious desert tribes..\n\nI'm not an expert on any of this, but it's just delightful to see a reference to history in a technical paper.",

I know it *looks* like a prank, but I think that there are core ideas in the paper that can be taken seriously, once you decode the jargon. Consider Ubuntu and Smalltalk. Both are technically \"open source\", but Ubuntu is neoliberal, and Smalltalk is anarchist. In Ubuntu, although you technically can get access to the source, you need to use the CLI to install source packages, and then you need a huge amount of technical expertise to make changes to the source, build new versions of the software, and install your modified programs. And then you are in trouble if you want to update. It's neoliberal because of the power imbalance between the user and the corporate structure that controls the source. In Smalltalk, all of the source code for the system you are running is instantly available, you can easily make small changes just by editing some text, and then you can immediately see the effects of your changes within a running system. The user has much more power and autonomy in a Smalltalk system: it is an anarchist approach to open source.",

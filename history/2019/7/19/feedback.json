        "text": "I like the underlying idea (abstract program definition from files and syntax), which fits in the forward-thinking perspective where programs are stored as semantic trees\/graphs instead of being encoded in text files.  However, it seems like the solutions you propose for addressing this problem might need to be further refined: if you do not store the programs in files, then you need to rethink the navigation between the program \"bits\". Another aspect is that you still store function definition as text, which I suppose is fine if you focus on solving the problem of storing and organizing structural elements (functions, type definitions, classes, etc) in a non file-based format. Hope this makes sense!",

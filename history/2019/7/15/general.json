        "text": "I find autocompletion for API stuff pretty great. I love that I can browse the API and an object's properties or methods and their arguments and types.\n\nI'm not convinced autocompletion of things like quotes, HTML tags, parenthesis, brackets, is a win yet. It's possible there is some sweet design I'm unaware of but in all the editors I use often I find this particular feature something I fight with to the point that if it's not an net loss it's at least not net positive. I suppose by that argument it actually is a net loss since having to deal with it is worse than not.\n\nIf it's not clear what I mean I type a quote `\"` and the editor\/IDE immediately inserts two quotes `\"\"` and puts the cursor in-between. I find often the editors I use get it wrong and it's several keystrokes to get the editor to insert what I want, not what it wants.\n\nAnyone else have similar experiences or see designs that \"just work\"? AFAICT this is a problem with structured editors in general as they can't tell what I want to type. They can only tell what keys I press. So if I typed `{` but meant to type `[` they could have already inserted 3 to 5 lines to code which now have to manually delete. They might work if press undo but the natural thing to do when I press the wrong key is to press backspace but if IDE inserted a bunch of stuff it has no way to know if I want to backspace over one of the many character it just inserted or if just want to backspace over the one character I thought it was going to insert.",

Details and example here: <https:\/\/wiki.haskell.org\/GHC\/Typed_holes> \n\nAs far as I know all you get from Haskell at this point is the expected type and a list of types “in scope” at that point. Idris, I believe, is a language that takes this further and tries to suggest what code you’re likely to write, and also supports this with a feature called “interactive editing”. I haven’t used Idris, so I don’t know how good it is at inferring the correct type if it is not trivial and needs some indirection, as in your example.",

Or  maybe i should say, being able to know the range of types doesn't tell you how they should  be constructed. If it does, then we just have pushed the problem downstream into \"how should they be constructed\".",

To make up a slightly more specific example: if, say, you’re working on a graphics library and you implement a function to draw a rectangle, you'll likely want to pass in parameters that describe the bounds of the rectangle. \n\nOn the lowest level, these could be four float values for x, y, width, and height. \nBut on a higher level, you could also pass in two vectors: position and size; and these could be of the same type (vector) or of different types (point, dimensions). \nAnd on an even higher level you could just pass in a single parameter frame.\n\nAPI design and the chosen types and data structures will play a huge part in how well auto completion and similar tools can make useful suggestions for you.",

When creating tools for the long term it's worth thinking about such secondary incentives. Tools are easily turned into externalities.\n\nI think the right place for tools is to make programming more accessible to newcomers. But they should be explicitly designed to be outgrown. Otherwise making a tool to support say functions with 10 arguments is just an invitation for people to create functions with 20 arguments.\n\nIn particular, tools that solve pain points in today's mainstream stacks won't always be part of the 'future of programming' (i.e. escape the evolutionary dead end the mainstream finds itself in). Sometimes changing two things at once may give better results. But you may not be able to use such a solution at work.",

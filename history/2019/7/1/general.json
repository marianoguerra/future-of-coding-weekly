        "text": "Excel has a closed arithmetic where each cell can have a value of varying type, but there are 2 meta-values that a cell can have, undefined and error (denoted #UNDEF and #ERROR) which automatically propagate using a closed arithmetic (in the algebraic sense that all operations stay inside the same set). A predictable, stable arithmetic model that is not present in C for example which has maybe a 32 bit integer number, which cannot store either metavalue. Extending arithmetic has serious consequences, as you can no longer use the arithmetic of the underlying hardware, which means you are going to be 10x slower. So right away you must decide in your language, are you going for maximum performance, or maximum robustness. In my Beads project, i have imitated Excel, and it has vast repercussions, as connections to the outside world have to be converted. But it pays dividends in robustness as every operation has a predictable and consistent result, with zero chance of undefined behavior. Contrast that with other languages where uninitialized variables are basically random number generators, and languages where enums are represented by simple integers and one can accidentally do arithmetic on them.",

        "text": "In my Discus labeling product, which sold a million copies, it was written in a very efficient medium level language called Modula-2. But after profiling it, i found that certain operations were sluggish because it involved triple loops, with per-pixel calculations. Those operations were rewritten in assembler for that 4x speedup which only comes with hand tuning which registers hold which values, and taking advantage of the many weird quirks of the i386 architecture. So i say use the most efficient for programmer time language you have available, and only after the product is in testing do you run benchmarks, identify the slow parts, replace them. A huge fraction of a program is not performance sensitive, and the programming cost especially in elapsed time, is often of great importance. People are way too harsh about performance, and way too liberal with their time. There is undisputed evidence that a person writes about the same number of lines per day of debugged code regardless of the language, so leverage is applied by using a higher level, more powerful language. If you work for Adobe and are in charge of the Gaussian blur function, you will spend man years making it work on 20 core machines, but for most of us regular folk, getting our product out the door with few to no bugs is the overriding goal.",

        "text": "Backing up a bit, toward the main topic of the thread...\n\nWhat I like about Electron is that I can use the platform I'm most familiar with (HTML, CSS, JS, SVG, WebGL, etc) and am best equipped to do a good job of — call that dev productivity, sure, but for me (a dev team of 1) it's simply the difference between having a _so-so_ native app, or not having one at all... and my teammates would rather use a so-so native app than have to do their work in a browser. That's just the limitations I'm personally under, and Electron is a good fit.\n\nFor a team with the size and resources of Slack, it's downright negligent that they don't write first-class truly native apps for the three major platforms. Their Electron app is bloated, laggy, toxic garbage — it is a constant fixture in the \"APPS USING SIGNIFICANT ENERGY\" section of my battery toolbar, even when it's idle in the background... what the fuck. My electron app is never shows up there, and is a highly interactive drawing+coding tool that holds a steady 60fps when in active use, lags less while doing complex graphics than Slack lags while typing text, and _immediately_ drops to totally inert code (no running event loops) as soon as the user lets go. You can totally make a complex Electron app that is well behaved.\n\nI also have some native apps on my Mac that, like Slack, are _should be simple_ but also have these sorts of performance problems. You can write a bad, slow, misbehaving app using any toolkit. Electron just happens to have inherited the NPM culture of \"cobble it together on top of a big heavy UI framework\" and \"dependencies are fine\" and \"just use pre-made components\" and \"don't learn the low-level\", instead of the Obj-C\/Swift\/Rust\/C++ culture of mechanical empathy.",

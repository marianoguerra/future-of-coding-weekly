So far, I've seen many interesting things but the benefit to CS seems trivial (i.e. you can accomplish the same things w\/o resorting to category theory). With CT, however, you are able express much of the same stuff in a way that's more 'clean' and ensures some safety\/correctness properties for free. The huge drawback is, obviously, that now your team has to be proficient in abstract math\/CT. Is the juice worth the squeeze? Who knows ... ¯\\_(ツ)_\/¯",

The focus on local whenever possible is surely the right technical, privacy, and … well, economic (?) approach. On “economic”, local data and user ownership seems much more likely to reduce data siloing, which is a natural barrier to entry for any kind of centralised system to exploit.",

It’s wonderful for eventual consistency, but I don’t see how to create types in it where I can identify a specific system state and pass that about being sure that everyone will be able to resolve exactly the same configuration that I have identified. I could also hash what I see, but then the state might have changed since the hash was created and surely there needs to be a way to avoid this.",

        "text": "Mr. Johnson has got the idea. The whole point of a closed arithmetic is to eliminate IF statements. In the old days of computing, every function would have an error return value, and after each function call would be an IF statement to abort the rest of the computation should an error be found. Over time, people got lazy and started to skip the IF statements, and a million bugs were born. fast forward to today, and nobody wants error codes or to write IF statements, so the current idea is to limp along and at least not crash, often foolishly hoping each function never fails.  The fundamental issue is that many things can fail. Erlang had an interesting attitude about what to do when an intermediate function encounters a failure; just crash the thread and start all over. A unique philosophy, borne of the harsh crucible Erlang was formed in, that of a headless box that has to run for years. For graphical interactive programs however, restarting suddenly is not a comfortable interaction style, so the crash + start over idea doesn't play there.  Haskell's Either construct is merely a wrapper around multiple values and is not the same thing as a closed arithmetic. I am not familiar with Swift's result, but again, these language features are typically tacked on at the end, and are not baked into the core arithmetic like they are in Excel and Beads. Closed arithmetic is a property like being a prime number; it is a mathematical property that is either present or not, and if you don't have it you will pay for that omission sooner or later. I find the Java approach of using Try\/Catch to be horrendous as it causes spooky action at a distance, something that bothered Einstein and all people who value sturdiness and understandability.",

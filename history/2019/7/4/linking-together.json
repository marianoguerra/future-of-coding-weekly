Whenever I end up modelling systems on a big scale, I end up drawing things like. So this is like layers of the system with each layer containing subsystems that can be layered or are graphs in themselves. Now these entities are in flux in that they change their topology as time progresses. This is the biggest model I can conjure up to visually articulate my conceptual understanding of most systems.\n\nMy question is, are these the natural concepts to represent complex systems or are there simpler fundamental units that can be composed to build bigger systems that generate the desired system dynamics? Have you guys come across anything in the literature? I have this inkling that graphs . could probably be expressed with some sort of simple units of composition.",

The nesting would happen along the z-axis, into the screen, so it'd be as if your camera were at the top of that image pointing down.\n\nSo to answer your question... for me, yes, this is the most natural way to mentally visualize complex systems.\n\nOne aspect not shown in this image is that this you'd need the outer structure to be a graph, not a tree. For instance, a math utility library that helps you deal with real numbers might be referenced in many otherwise separate systems.\n\nThis can still be visualized as _layers, where when travelling from one layer down to the next, each point in the upper layer expands—like a cone—into a region of the lower layer_, you'd just have some of the points expand down to the same region in the layer below.\n\nThere are other similar tweaks you'd need to make to account for recursion, or the fact that the same shared code might be referenced from many different layers (eg: if the top layer references the math library, and a lower layer does too).\n\nBut in the most simple form, your image is fantastic.",

        "text": "Yes, there are quite some systems still uses. One popular Java library is Drools. They also have a section in their docs dedicated for the history of expert system (or knowledge representation and reasoning): <https:\/\/docs.jboss.org\/drools\/release\/6.5.0.Final\/drools-docs\/html\/ch05.html#d0e4247>\n\nRule engines are even used in games. The HD remake of Age of Empires II for example used them. Here is my copy of the circa 30,000 lines of code rules file: <https:\/\/gist.github.com\/hastebrot\/ddac3624aaf7963f59a798f8ad5a0a16>\n\nUsing Java sometimes means that they neglect the frontend almost completely. I saw systems where they only offered a textarea widget to author the rules, with the assumption, the business analysts will keep the rules simple (less then 10 lines of code) and everything will be fine. I saw rules with 100 lines of code.",

        "text": "I’ve had a major paradigm shift in the last month or so. Before, I didn’t consider parameters as scope, nor closure as mutation. Now I’m starting to see that when a function rebinds its parameters, it’s modifying its environment - it’s mutating things. That’s why it’s possible to simulate mutable state with recursive functions. If you’re trying to avoid the complexity caused by mutable state, I think  any parameter bound more than once needs to be considered mutation.",

        "text": "I hear you about DCI, and that's why it took me months to really get what it was about. It sounds like a mechanistic thing, but doesn't give you any new abilities that you didn't already have before. But then I realized that it's really just about cleaning up badly factored program-flow in OOP code.\n\nIt's very common in OOP to take a use case \/ scenario \/ flow and have each data entity own a slice of it. But the data boundaries are very misaligned with the overall execution boundaries, so \"what the program does\" becomes very convoluted. DCI is about *still* slicing up an execution into pieces, but keeping the relevant pieces together. Specifically, instead each class having methods from multiple use cases, those methods are associated to \"roles\", with are placeholders for whatever objects will participate in that execution flow \/ use case.\n\nBut there is no need to have a flow be sliced up into methods that each most be \"owned\" by some object. But if that's what it means to do \"OOP\", then DCI is a way to put related functionality together in a way that's \"still OOP\". Well, I see no value in OOP if that's what OOP means; but the organization of flow AND the organization of data being two separate things that are meaningfully laid out in their own rite (rather than having one be in terms of the other) ... THAT makes a lot of sense, and doesn't need any mechanism like DCI to do it. And you'll find that such code very much matches the human mental model of what the software is and what it does.\n\nBut DCI is what introduced me to thinking that way, because much OOP is very primarily \"thing\" oriented, or otherwise relies on complex mechanisms to \"wire it up\" another way. So for me, DCI (if you throw out the mechanism but look at what it's trying to do) is about just making code sane to begin with.\n\nI've had a lot of success applying those principles in my career, especially among horrible OOP code.\n\nIt's my opinion that many \"OO programmers\" don't know (or have forgotten) how to think on simple terms.\n\nI'll post some more links, later",

        "text": "Yeah, I think you said it very well. I think a lot of what's trying to be mechanized or fixed in OOP is just a poor replacement for plain old procedural flow\/logic, and my claim is that many OOP programmers don't know how it have forgotten.\n\nWhen it pains me the most is when I see thousands or tens of thousands of lines of mechanism, for what could be a few hundred lines of code. My opinion is that the same way to do that with OOP is that classes represent data entities, and class methods ONLY operate on what's encapsulated by the class. Behaviors of the system itself remain more or less procedural \/ functional.\n\nSome languages (Java, C#) require all functions to be methods of some class. You can either have one class representing the whole system, defined essentially procedurally as a bunch of static methods, or you can break the system into discrete high level components. But really this is just the same kind of organization that can be done without classes (it's just that that's the only kind of \"container\" that since language offer). But there's not necessarily a gain to having a \"thing\" called a parser, versus saying \"here's all the parsing code\" like a mini library.\n\nAnyway, the classes or other containers in this sense will tens to represent what a human would think about as components of the system. For example, an ATM user might think of things called Accounts and Transactions; but something like a configuration-wire-upper or a component-manager are not real parts of a software system in any meaningful sense (unless managing configurations and components *is* the service that the software provides to the end user).\n\nBut what amazes me is that either nobody can see it, or they don't believe it can be that simple, and so they rely on massive infrastructure to fix problems that could be handled through just fine through*basic* principles. And that's what makes me think that many software engineers don't really have a form grasp of the basics. Going to extremes to \"manage\" complexity that they take as a given, but which is largely artificial.",

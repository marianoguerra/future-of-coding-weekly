I am more interested in how we can get these ideas to common languages that people use everyday. I don't know if you have looked at type level computations - they are a limited for of dependent types and have a lot of power. A recent paper that I co-authored brought type-level computations to dynamic languages (like Ruby) and we found bugs in website in Discourse etc.",

        "text": "Hi everyone! My name is Nicolas and I live in Toulouse, France.\n\nI love coding since I first try it (maybe at 11) and do it for a living for more than twenty years (as a computer scientist and a scientist in remote sensing imaging). I like discovering and experimenting new things in computer science. My recent interests are WebAssembly, Vue.js and Rust. Several years ago I cofound \"la Compagnie du Code\", an organization in Toulouse that organizes workshops to give childrens the opportunity to code and practice creative computing and computationnal thinking. My main tool for that is MIT's Scratch.\n\nI am convinced that for now programming is a uneccessary complicated and I am wondering how this activity can evolve to permit more people to do it, even those that are not professionnal programmers but that can benefit from a bit of programming every now and then. My guess is that one key thing to bring more people to code is visual coding. So I am here, maybe because on my search on visual programming resources I once heard of Bret Victor, then later found some reference to him in \"Future of Coding\" and find this initiative very inspiring! :slightly_smiling_face: I know I have *lots* of stuff to read and discuss to learn what people have expermients in that field...\n\nSo my vision is a visual coding platform on top of web standards. I know there are lots of visual programming semantics that have been invented\/experimented since several decades, and it is not new to try to bring people to programming this way, and none has really succeeded (some more than others, but none has became a standard or is widely used). But I am convinced that there is some stuff to experiment! I have started to read some content of <http:\/\/futureofcoding.org|futureofcoding.org> and what I have read so far is very close to my vision, in particular in <https:\/\/futureofcoding.org\/about#mission> where lots of points I should have wrote myself, except that I focus less on low level language, which is important, but for me the first step is the visual parts.\n\nTo conclude, I hope my trip in this slack and with the \"Future of Coding\" community will make me challenge my thoughts, discover some new inspiring visions and people, and experiment more on that field!",

Kinda like a kid asking for a candy bar for xmas instead of wishing for a nice new red bicycle with all the extras... why not ask for a toolchain where you can write with almost no branching?, and where most of the code goes straight down (the easiest kind of code to handle), and an environment where the total number of API's that you use on a regular basis numbers in the dozens, instead of thousands? You forgot the greatest wish of all, which is to have support for that phase where you product has shipped to your millions of active users, and you have a way of recreating each and every user bug report so that the product converges towards zero bugs, instead of hovering at hundreds of thousands of \"not reproducible\" bugs like there are in the Apple, Adobe, and Microsoft bug databases!",

I agree with your suggestions, but I want to implement the tooling I talked about for two existing languages: Haskell and PureScript. That makes some of these ideas impossible.\n\nIn the long run, I also want the things you mentioned, but until then I want to improve the development experience for a language that already exists and has an ecosystem. Having said that, I want to address some of the things you mentioned.\n\n<@UAL7940NM>, regarding invalid states, I was thinking of allowing a scratch pad where you can simply paste text. Other than that, the operations that I see on the AST are: adding a node, deleting it, moving it around and transforming it into a different node. The last one seems trickiest. I have in mind an interface similar to Vim input mode. Combine this with the fact that each Haskell declaration has a keyword, so you can write the keyword and press TAB (snippets style) and the form to add that specific declaration emerges. I haven’t given this a lot of thought, so the details are hazy.\n\nI agree with what you said about compilation. As I said, I want to build this tooling for Haskell and PureScript. I already knew about Lambdu and Unison from your list.\n\n<@UH84GQ3CZ>, I’ll have to think more about what you said regarding the semantics. this part is not clear to me either.\n\nthank you all for your feedback!",

There's the \"think big\" approach of starting from scratch and more incremental approaches like improving the tooling for an existing language. To me, all of them are equally interesting and fit into this slack. \"my thoughts on the ideal development toolset\" in your original post made me think that you're trying to \"think big\" and under that assumption, your suggestions seemed \"conservative\" (which is the gist of Edward's feedback as well). Knowing that your goal is to be compatible with existing programming languages changes the perspective.\nPlease keep posting about your work here :wink:",

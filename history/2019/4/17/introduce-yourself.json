        "text": "Good morning and hello all. My name is Jason Priestley, I'm a bay area software developer. I have one big idea for the future of software. It's hard to describe because it either sounds vague or trivial or incomprehensible depending on how I describe it, so I'll describe it in a few ways, and perhaps the sum will give a better sense of things.\n\nMy idea is to unify programmer and user. Seen from the programmer's side, this means an IDE that provides the discoverability and rich graphical UI that user's enjoy. Seen from the user's side, this means that their walled-garden \"apps\" are now part of one big app, they are unknowingly editing code by clicking buttons, and there is a smooth transition between graphical UI and code.\n\nMy idea is to bring the Lisp REPL into the graphical era. Read and Print are text-based primitives. The modern equivalent is a graphical UI that can extend and edit itself. The extension method may resemble Reader macros, but instead of taking over Read at certain syntax, it takes over the whole UI.\n\nMy idea is to make data into code. Lisp made code into data - a function declaration is also a linked list. Data into code means that whenever you are operating on data - editing a TODO list say - you are literally editing code in one big program. Editing your TODO list is a specialized UI that does the exact same thing as opening the TODOs variable in your code editor and typing out your changes manually.\n\nMy idea is to make a universal editor. Instead of one editor and many apps you have one editor that can be changed and customized to take on any behavior.\n\nMy idea is to complete the idea behind Emacs. People joke that Emacs is an OS, that you can do anything in Emacs. I take these jokes seriously. An extensible editor should be our OS, but emacs is too ad-hoc and too tied to text buffers to really suffice. Emacs, but the primitive operations are more low-level UI constructs, and graphical from the start.",

The structure editor is written to be highly extensible by the basic operation of matching on syntax and taking over the UI at that point. Users can register syntax-editors, share them etc. They range from the simplest color picker up to potentially, a full graphical UI. More likely, the superior interoperability provided by this architecture would lead to smaller, more focused bits of UI that would be mixed-and-matched ... today's heavy, monolithic UIs would disappear",

But an important part of any such projectional syntax sugar is that it doesn’t limit you and allows you also, if you wish, to also perform edits that change the code to anything really, even if it no longer fits the timeline pattern.. So that this timeline-like interface is for concatenating a bunch of videos in a literal list, and then the user wants to concatMap the list so that each video repeats twice - then they could do that but it just won’t have the timeline interface anymore, unless someone creates a sugar for that more complicated pattern too.\n\nBut to do that, I think that we need to start with a good ground to stand on. That’s why we’re starting with the more lower-lever programmingy stuff.\n\nIIUC Unison also has this in their grand vision, which is kind of what Paul Chiusano refers to when he talks about “UX derived from type theory”. And so Hazel too probably shares the same vision.",

        "text": "&gt;  IDE that provides the discoverability\nYep—current IDEs could do a much better job here!\n&gt; Data into code means that whenever you are operating on data - editing a TODO list say - you are literally editing code in one big program.\nThis is called “programming by demonstration”. It has pros and cons. The hard bit is “inference”: figuring what abstract operation the user intended by the single demonstrated example. DM me if you want a reference list. At the most basic level you can just dump a list of commands in order to a file (like a bash history) and not try to be smart, but these sorts of programs are not the highest quality. In Sketch-n-Sketch we’ve been playing around with an output-directed refactoring approach, but it’ll take some work to generalize that to general purpose programs. (c.f. <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9JcKnJyufD8>)\n&gt; My idea is a structure editor that operates on a unified database of code, shared by all users.\nI understand this is also <@UC25EFSJC>’s vision for Hazel (<http:\/\/hazel.org\/>). He uses the term “Wikipedia” of code where everything is editable by everyone.\n&gt; The structure editor is written to be highly extensible by the basic operation of matching on syntax and taking over the UI at that point. Users can register syntax-editors, share them etc.\nAgreed! My current understanding is that the matching might be better done by types, actually. Hazel is moving in this direction, I believe.\n&gt; An extensible editor should be our OS\nAgreed! OSes need revisiting—they don’t provide good enough interfaces between disparate code elements.\n&gt; today’s heavy, monolithic UIs would disappear\nWe can hope! But I don’t think “everything is code” gets you all the way there. Even within a single language, there’s a big interface problem between software components and you’ve got to have a story for that. The problem is that it’s hard to (a) understand what kind of data the other source provides, (b) figure out the API to get it, and then (c) mangle the data into the form you need it.",

Even the differences with Lamdu that Hazel highlights, like Lamdu stopping evaluations on holes while Hazel resumes are not differences in vision but just in what we have got to implement so far.",

Welcome, aboard!\n\nMeta question: How does it feel to get flood of responses like \"Heyy it's pretty much I am working on.\"?\nIt's quite fascinating how similar conclusions people get more or less independently.\n\n-Consider is it code editor where the code is also data or is it \"just\" a data editor where the code is one possible domain (I prefer last one).\n    -I am really excited about empowering users for more complex use cases with Unix like reusable tools where classic GUIs are not powerful enough.\n    -A dream from an application developer point of view would be that you just describe part of your API and you would get super powerful UI cheaply.\n-I think some typing is required and for free data editing, I think it shouldn't be nominal.\n-One of my current problems is that what should a code execution look like? You can show a representation of computation result (diagram, SmallTalk GUI) and look for specific element and code behind it or the complete opposite where you can see partial results inside of your code. Or something completely different? You sided this slightly with REPL but it's pretty vague.\n&gt; Read and Print are text-based primitives. The modern equivalent is a graphical UI that can extend and edit itself.\nSo unsolved problem(?), all ideas are welcome.",

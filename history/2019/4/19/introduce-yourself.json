        "text": "Edward, I understand what you mean! Bad usability \/ presentation is what is driving many of us to try to make things better. What I've described above is not the end goal, it's just the required mechanism to create a tool that can customize itself to *become* whatever is the best tool or representation for a whatever you want to use it for.\n\nThe idea is not for something Lispy to be what's actually presented. That's just a good structure for storing and data representation. I actually think if it more like JSON.\n\nThe idea is to be able to say \"for this given code or data, draw this (perhaps very different) UI\".",

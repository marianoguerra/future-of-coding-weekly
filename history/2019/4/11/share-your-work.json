In order to support Siri, Apple had to inject quite a bit of knowledge about the world, and in a recent talk by Stephen Wolfram, who arguably has the best track record in history for interchangeable parts, he talked about how when he started Wolfram Alpha only had a few heuristics, and now the thing is mostly heuristics. Unlike most of the other prior work, the Wolfram language has not changed hardly at all in 25 years. He's either a very stubborn person, or he did a superb job in the beginning, or perhaps a mixture of both.",

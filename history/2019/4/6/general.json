Learning to stop before entering \"Artichoke Mode\" is part of learning to be a professional programmer.",

It's supposed to be the future \"computable surfaces\" or something like that. I can certainly imagine via AR putting virtual controls and displays on any surface or to use any object as input (not saying it has to be AR, just saying shared AR glasses would make it easy to use anywhere assuming AR glasses existed ... they don't yet ... unless you count hololens\/magicleap)\n\nThe shared environment also seemed like an environment for learning. If my actual computing environment was so free an open then every program could steal all my secrets.\n\nAnd of course I only saw small programs, ~100 lines or less, where as I didn't see truely complex apps and it wasn't clear how to jump from a few toy projects to big projects.\n\nStill it looked really fun to play with.",

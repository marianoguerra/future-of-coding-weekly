        "text": "Actually, the original apple file system had a thing called a resource fork, which allowed the file to have a data part, and then it allowed a second partition containing meta-data, which was accessible via a set of records accessed by unique 4 letter codes. This allowed people to store comments about a file without disturbing the file contents. It was a brilliant system, later removed by apple because the internet kept stripping the hidden fork. In a bizarre twist of fate, MS was busy in multi-year effort to copy this feature, and then they pulled the plug, one of the only regrets Bill Gates had was not following through on this improved file system. Thank the stupid Unix file system for blunting the progress away from the archaic unstructured byte stream system, which is a millstone around everyone's neck.",

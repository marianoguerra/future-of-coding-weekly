        "text": "I think that “visual” usually communicates something else. Perhaps the more appropriate term is “projectional”?\n\nI’ll clarify by defining some terms as I see them:\n\n• Traditional text programming - freeform editing of text\n• Structural - Edits are done on structure. Code may still be stored as text (paredit is an example)\n• Visual - looks nothing like text. Data flow is visualised by the layout using nodes and arrows\n• Projectional - the UI displays something which isn’t an exact straightforward presentation of the code storage.\n\nFor example a language where the user draws an image of a diagram in Paint\/Photoshop\/etc and then the compiler turns the painting into a program is visual but not projectional.",

I’m thinking of (as usual) music or video production tools, where a lot of the visual tools rely on metaphors that represent time by mapping it to (horizontal) space, which rests on the importance of time in these domains.\n\nIf you can’t define certain specifics because you want to create something universal, the visualizations available to you will be limited to the most abstract of domains, often math — and then you end up representing minimal structure as an abstract graph, with generic arrows, their positions and lengths without meaning, pointing from and to equally as dimensionless boxes, all floating in a space that has no meaningful coordinates either — you can move things around and it doesn’t change anything other than the visualization.",

I think \"visual\" is only a useful term when you want to use it to distinguish between displaying data as a 1D, serialized sequence of symbols versus some other kind of visualisation where the layout is not so trivial. This implies that any \"visual\" language would also be a \"structural\" one. The tricky thing about equating the two is that for some reason, people who make structural editors oftentimes try their hardest to make everything look like a serialized sequence of symbols. IMO that only leads to an obscuration of the structure being manipulated, and for what benefit? It's a kind of Stockholm Syndrome that I've recently snapped out of.",

With arrows we get to represent some of the references visually, at the expense of trying very hard to only have the thing they refer to represented once.\n\nI know, there’s the joke about naming being one of the two or three (depending on how funny you try to be) hardest things in programming.

        "text": "I'm seeing the proliferation of this false dichotomy again between text and visuals. Text IS a visual. This is a more relevant point than it appears at first glance. It indicates that you can mix text with other kinds of visuals. Despite what has historically been produced, the other kinds of visuals do not have to be in the form of boxes and arrows, or lego blocks, or anything which has proven itself objectively bad through 5 decades of repeated failed attempts. I believe people designing these visuals just need to try something different.\nIt's true that there aren't many concepts in an abstract language that can even be visualised. But there are some. Two major dimensions are *composition* and *choice*. Almost every language construct in any *functional* language is just a combination of these. (Imperative languages throw in 70 other \"features\" which I argue makes visualisation a fool's errand). Function application, function composition, product types, and sum types are just different flavours of composition. If-expressions, case-expressions, and pattern matching are all just different flavours of choice. Visualising these naively leads you to some kind of graph, which leads to a naive boxes and arrows visualisation. But Stefan rightly points out that humans are good at recognising names, and are bad at navigating a soup of arrows, so we should probably use names as the building blocks of the visualisation. This does *not* necessarily lead to \"text-based programming\", but it does lead to a generous use of text within the visualisation.",

        "text": "That's an argument for why \"visual languages\" shouldn't be thrown in the trash heap but not for why they should be pursued. To shed light on the latter proposition: I teach people how to code for a living, and one solid truth that reveals itself is that keyword-and-symbol-based representations of language constructs are hard to understand. We may not realise with our survivorship bias just how unintuitive a bunch of keywords are, but a language's syntax is fundamentally a representation of its semantics, and learning a language is about being able to recognise, comprehend, and interact with that semantics. Keywords and ASCII symbols obscure language semantics to an extreme degree. This is not merely an assertion - it is extraordinarily apparent from watching people learn how to code. The only question is: how can we do better?",

Here’s what I did for two years, and it worked great in a 1-on-1 setting: <http:\/\/akkartik.name\/post\/mu> (Spoiler: it’s absolutely text-based).\n\nI saw no problems with (a small number of) keywords. I _did_ see value in minimizing punctuation. One implication: don’t start kids on one of the Lisps. (Even though I love Lisp in general.)\n\nI don’t understand your “It’s 90% boxes-and-arrows, 8% Scratch clones, and 2% of unique stuff” comment. Why chase novelty for its own sake? Similarly, I don’t think boxes and arrows or blocks have been given nearly enough rope in the last 5 decades. You’ll need to elaborate on why you think they’re “objectively bad”. It’s not at all obvious that we need to try something different. One could equally make the case that we need to _persist_ with and incrementally improve already-attempted ideas.

They've been given an excessive amount of rope: there are hundreds of boxes-and-arrows editors out there. They seem to have proven useful in niche scenarios, typically where only small structures are required. As discussed though, when using arrows for dataflow you inevitably end up with an arrow soup as you get larger; the visualisation just doesn't scale. I worked briefly with the world leaders in graph layout research and even they are still struggling with ways to make large graphs readable. But either way, it's not up to a disbeliever to prove the absence of something; it's up to a believer to prove its existence. If you'd like to argue for the merits of boxes-and-arrows, I'm open to discussing them with you.",

        "text": "Scratch blocks have merit in that they can be used to present a limited, browsable palette of building blocks with which programs can be constructed. But this is no different from having an ordinary list of options in a sidebar or tooltip. They also prevent syntax errors, but so do structure editors, so this is not a merit of the block representation itself. The only other merit they have is their ability to visually represent basic program structures such as loops. But they do so haphazardly: look at an \"if\" block in Scratch and you'll see that it's pretty much a Python if-statement in a gaudy yellow box. The structure it communicates is minimal.",

Another advantage is the drag and drop of blocks from a library that show all blocks, which make less intimidate to begin a program I guess. Of course, as you said, most of these advantages can also nearly be implemented in a structure editor.",

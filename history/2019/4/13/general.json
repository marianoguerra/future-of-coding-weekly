        "text": "It is very hard to discuss the future without mentioning what exists. Also, most of the future has already been invented, and was merely ignored at the time. I can probably mention a dozen features that appeared previously, or at least were specified in detail, and somehow never got into the mainstream languages. It is highly arrogant to imagine for example that John Backus, Niklaus Wirth, and others didn't invent all sorts of things that are still considered \"future\". In fact you can make a stellar product just by going back at the past work that was glossed over for some reason. There are so many fascinating things in engineering history that have been forgotten or derailed. The Chrysler Turbine Car, Geopolymerization of stone of the Great Pyramid at Giza, Tensegrity, PROLOG deductive capabilities, etc.",

I also believe the environment must be seen as a language, rather than an agglomeration of features as it is mostly treated today. For example, Emacs goes in this direction.\n\nHere is a reasoning: When a person is presented with two presentations of the same content and they would yield different results in terms of the effectiveness of understanding that content, it should follow that the form is essential. It also follows that understandability is not only a property of content alone. That is the case with data. And as software is data, it is also the case with software.\n\nMoldable development starts from this assumption, and we validated it over the past ten years quite thoroughly (much of the validation is seen under humane assessment, which is a subset of moldable development).\n\nSo, I am saying that only focusing on language and code, we ignore an essential property and this will always provide a partial understanding of our domain. I maintain that the environment is an essential subject of study that we did not address systematically until now.\n\nDoes this address the question?",

Perhaps the consensus is closer to what you say, that the distinction itself made in this way is perhaps not that accurate or useful ultimately. But I'm interested to know if there are particular reasons why prototypes in this domain tend to be language &amp; code focused, rather than starting from this apparently broader perspective of an \"environment\".",

My project is all about making better tooling \/ environment for creating and manipulating software, specifically by making the tool modifiable from within itself, still you can mold the best tools and environment yourself. (And that may include molding the tools for molding).\n\nHowever, like Tudor says, I also see the separation between language and environment to be superficial. For example, the idea is to have whatever representation is best suited for what you are making. That might be a table, or it might be code. The rules for converting that representation to running code is moldable -- so if that representation is \"code\", then you are (to some extent) molding an interpreter or a compiler, and thus a language. So even the concept of \"language\" is part of the environment.\n\nBut I suppose you could say the reverse: that a view with windows and buttons and diagrams is also the \"language\" that a tool is presenting (or allowing you to present) something in.",

But it's good to have lots of choices. There's hope of finding some way out in the humongous state space.\n\n\"Environment vs language\" is an unnecessarily blunt way to think about this state space. You give up a lot of room for maneuver if you try to build the language completely before thinking about the environment, or vice versa.\n\nThere's always an environment even if it's implicit. If you think of yourself as just creating a language the environment is some lowest denominator like Unix. But according to the recent poll, most people here are creating something totally novel, with no connection to Unix or other extant platforms. Focusing on the language is a particularly fraught activity for us. It's going to close us to many opportunities. So I find it more useful to fold 'language' back into the environment, and just think of the environment as a whole. How can I gradually accumulate a new environment (over many years) in a way that gets me a steady stream of feedback along the way? This framing avoids the hazard of over-emphasizing languages in our current culture. It also requires letting go of preconceptions of 'environment' like that it has to be graphical or involve IDEs.\n\n(This mindset is also why I pushed back against discussing languages in isolation here a few days ago. It's not just some administrative discussion to be relegated to <#CEXED56UR|meta>. We're all building a whole new environment from scratch, and it's an immense challenge. There's no way to approach that without also thinking about the way we frame it in our heads, and constantly try to correct biases. Building something new and large from scratch necessarily involves debate of _philosophy_[1].)\n\n[1] Henry Ford's autobiography is startlingly philosophical: <http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/7213>",

        "text": "Since people program only in entire systems, one must always consider language and environment together. The graphical language people have sometimes no visible textual language, The Luna people are trying to make it bidirectional between graphical and textual, and then there are many projects which are primarily textual in nature, but have some wizards\/helpers to make some part of the process less tedious and more direct.\n\nBut the underlying language, whether it be textual or graphical internally, is the key thing; after all the environment is there to make it easier to make a finished product, and the final stored artifact is the goal, and the environment is typically not present in the final product. Thus the environment is providing scaffolding; temporary structure that helps in the development and testing. If you are trying to get products into users' hands as quickly as possible, the minimum you can build is the underlying artifact, and the tooling around it can wait until later. Many languages don't need more than a text editor for tooling to build something. Tools like Glamorous Toolkit are highly optimized for Pharo, and i think that to a great extent the tooling is often very specific to a language. For years people used Eclipse, now VSCode and Intellij Idea seem to be the top 2 environments, and they are fairly language neutral.\n\nThe more radical the language improvement, the more radical the changes to the tooling will have to be, and i expect that many of the languages being built by the members of this forum will have great difficulty fitting into the conventional forms that VSCode and Idea utilize, which are basically refinements of Eclipse.",

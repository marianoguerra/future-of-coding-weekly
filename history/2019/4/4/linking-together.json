        "text": "i gather from the prior work of the founders that this is a server side technology, in that sense probably more like Dark language. The odd thing is that it is built in Clojure, but doesn't mention a language at all, so i infer that this project is about facilitating setting up server clusters, offering dashboards, scripting, failover control, etc. so more like an evolution of the tools AWS offers, but not proprietary to Amazon. This is of course a guess, but if you have been doing research for years, and haven't come up with a language, you probably didn't have the intention of creating one in the first place.\n\nI don't consider a toolchain that doesn't include a language to be a major breakthrough. Without creating a new era of interchangeable parts, you haven't gone to the next gen IMHO",

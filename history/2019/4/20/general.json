        "text": "In my company one of the ways to be fired for sure is to refuse to document your work so it can be transferred to others. Our guiding principle is that every key system has at least 3 people that know it, so that if someone is on vacation or getting married or sick we have coverage. Achieving 24\/7 uptime only happens with multiple people \"in the know\".  Having to repair and improve other people's code, and also working in team environments on large commercial products builds a certain discipline. Just picking good names for functions and variables is a big part of making code easier to understand for others. It is actually one of the tests that i am doing which is to take a program, give it to someone other than the author, and have them make some specific improvement or fix. You can measure this, and see how many hours it takes to accomplish the task for the new person and how much damage if any was created by the changes. The priesthood of programming has been kept in place through intentional obscurity, and companies greatly fear losing authors because often bad breakage occurs on transfer to a new person. Case in point: Apple broke printing in OSX 10.13.0, and didn't have it repaired until 10.13.4, and then broke it again in 10.14.0, and got it fixed in 10.14.2. Printing is a rather fundamental activity in a desktop computer, and you know it was all due to different people doing changes. Avoiding deep interconnections is the key factor in achieving interchangeable parts; gotta keep the linkages shallow and easy to perceive. Nothing more non-interchangeable than a 50 level deep call chain which is so common in Java programs. I consider Java one of the worst languages ever designed because of this extreme depth, and the use of OOP which creates islands of state which are un-knowable from examining the code.",

        "text": "Here’s my summary. The language in the paper is grandiose, which I found off-putting. If you wade through that, here’s what you find Bosque contains, in some rough order of goodness\/novelty (most to least):\n\n1. Primitives for collection operations (`map`, `filter`, `fold` etc)—no looping constructs. (Recursion is allowed but discouraged—you have to mark _callsites_ to recursive functions with `rec`.)\n2. Those collection primitives are packaged with pre- and post- conditions to ease verification. (The verification story is a bit hand-wavy though.)\n3. Execution produces deterministic results, but there’s no guarantees on intermediate execution order. If a piece of code throws errors in parallel, which error is thrown may be non-deterministic, but that *some* error is thrown is deterministic.\n4. Function arguments are (apparently) matched by name and by type first, and then by position. This is an idea I’ve wanted to explore because it’s superficially more ergonomic but there may be some tricky downsides (e.g. with complicated arg matching rules, how do you determine if an API change breaks existing code?).\n5. There’s special syntax for denoting optional values that can be `none`, and syntax for allowing method calls on `none` to return `none` instead of crashing.\n\nThe following ideas are extolled in the paper but I don’t think they are quite so novel or worthy:\n\n1. Local multiple assignments to the same variable are not actually mutations of the same memory location. I’ve thought about this before: the naive version doesn’t work work all the time because where you want multiple assignment is in folds and the above semantics doesn’t work there.\n2. All objects support record update syntax and record merge syntax. What’s novel here is applying this to a more traditional OO model; but its core is just plain old functional record update syntax. There’s also a field projection syntax, which is handy.\n3. Well defined interface to the outside world. It’s a good idea to have an API to the OS, but the writeup makes it sound like this solves all the messy IO system call stuff when really it just pushes that mess out of scope of the language. You’ll still have to deal with it sometime.\n\nIdeas perhaps worth discarding:\n\n1. No referential equality (that’s fine) but to support custom equality measures you simply define a field named `key` on your objects\/records. You only get one of these: now you’re toast if you want a different equality metric or your equality metric wasn’t precise enough.\n2. No logging. (Stated justification: when your language is deterministic you don’t need logging.)",

                "text": "I&rsquo;m delighted to have accepted an offer to study at the University of Kent for a full-time PhD this September. I spent January doing most of the work for this which is why I didn&rsquo;t publish any posts that month. But now I&rsquo;ve finally got round to the task of announcing it here.\nBack in September, on Steve Krouse&rsquo;s Future of Programming Slack channel, somebody posted a link to Tomas Petricek&rsquo;s blog post Programming As Interaction, so thank you to whoever did that for starting me off on this path.\n\n\n\n1. Introduction\nSoftware as tools and products\nComputer software, seen as a medium, can behave in any way we want within the physical constraints of the device it&rsquo;s on. In theory, people are already carrying around universal simulators that they can tailor to their own desires. In practice, this is infeasible. Most software appears &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; or unchangeable, and must be accepted as-is.\nIf a user wants to adapt some spreadsheet for their own context, any ordinary spreadsheet application will do. But if they are dissatisfied with this application itself, then to do anything about it they must become familiar with its language, development, and architecture, before then forking and maintaining their own version &mdash; assuming it&rsquo;s open-source in the first place.\nEven if such an immense time investment succeeds, the same problem is simply pushed one step further. Although their text editor and compiler let them adapt the spreadsheet program to their wishes, if they wish to adapt these tools, they must go through the entire process again for each one.\nThe overarching metaphor is of &ldquo;making&rdquo; software &ldquo;products&rdquo; or &ldquo;artefacts&rdquo;, modifying them with software &ldquo;tools&rdquo;. Such do not come with their own mechanisms for adaptation, but rely instead on bringing in separate artefacts. The text editor, compiler, operating system and language runtime are all themselves software &ldquo;products&rdquo; previously &ldquo;built&rdquo; in such a way.\nNevertheless, all of this is software, made using itself. It must be asked whether the stark boundary between tool and product is really an unavoidable property of the material itself, or just a consequence of a particular methodology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe whole is different\nCuriously, when a programmer succeeds in hacking some desired change to their system, they do so using the very same system. All their work is accomplished by the same physical interface that they also &ldquo;use&rdquo; for everyday non-programming.\nThey certainly don&rsquo;t need to buy a separate &ldquo;development device&rdquo; to program their own tools, nor a &ldquo;development-device development device&rdquo; to address the shortcomings of that! At the &ldquo;whole device&rdquo; level, it isn&rsquo;t necessary to have &ldquo;something special and separate&rdquo; for development-as-opposed-to-use[1]. For the PC, the creation and adaptation of software is just another one of its uses.\nUnlike the real-world supply chain, any user of computer software can easily download their own personal copies of &ldquo;everything that is needed&rdquo;. Yet, in a world where separate tools produce separate products, making use of this demands ever-growing expertise with more and more of the entire software economy.\nAn individual has about as much chance of understanding that as they would have with the real-life economy, at the intimate level of detail required.\nIf we are so inclined to have software toolchains emulate the real world, where modifying a stage requires familiarity with its preceding stage &mdash; then the PC is surely a counterexample. Its adaptation doesn&rsquo;t translate to yet more stages on a pipeline. Could we give this property recursively to the software within it?\n([1] The story is less clear for smartphones, tablets and embedded systems, but this only applies one level deep. True, embedded computer system software is developed outside the target device, and then deployed onto it as a final step. But such software is developed on a self-programmable machine, just pushed one step away: the developer&rsquo;s computer.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware as something that must be interacted with\nThe actually-experienced reality of computing consists of humans interacting with a physical interface to a virtual world. This informs a model of software not as mathematical entities or lines of code, but as a dynamical system having time evolution in tight feedback with its user. The &ldquo;current state&rdquo; is defined by physical output capabilities[2], with the &ldquo;independent variables&rdquo; (besides time) defined by input capabilities[3].\nCurrently, achieving time-evolution of such overwhelmingly visual systems is accomplished through &ldquo;coding&rdquo;: a reductionist paradigm of serialising all non-textual entities in some way to text, to be suitable for automation via text. Colours, curves and polygons are worked with as lists of co-ordinates and quantities, themselves reduced to lists of digits &mdash; whether functioning as a count, length, angle, or something else. Thousands of words are routinely used to describe pictures.\nThe benefit of reductionism is the unifying of disparate concepts into a common representation. The benefit of this reductionism is to the implementors of basic tools:\n\n\n\n\n\nMonospaced glyphs in a single typeface are straightforward to lay out\nCharacter sets are well-defined, unlike the set of possible filled shapes\nInsert\/delete within a character list is trivial compared to the space of &ldquo;general graphical interactions&rdquo;\n\n\n\nBut the costs, as if obeying a conservation law, are pushed to the user. Much of the precious human cognitive budget is diverted, from the actual problem being solved, to tasks including:\n\n\n\nMental visualisation, simulation (while facing the screen of a universal simulator)\nTranscribing and decoding things that are not text\nEnsuring nested structures are correctly escaped, mentally decoding them back\nLocating, fixing, avoiding syntax errors\nASCII art, indentation management\n\n\n\nWith so much existing text-based infrastructure, it is tempting to automatically write off anything else as hopelessly impractical. Nevertheless, for too many programming tasks, text is decidedly not &ldquo;the right tool for the job&rdquo;.\n([2] Commonly: sounds and coloured shapes.)\n([3] Commonly: keyboard keys, mouse or touchscreen.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a nutshell\nThe dominant way of working with software is as a set of production lines, all blueprinted in monospaced ASCII. This is rather a lot of one-size-fits-all assumptions.\nIt would be good to have an alternative that invites context-sensitive variation. Users would adapt their own copies of software artefacts to fit themselves, not the other way around. Correspondingly, designers of artefacts would not be dumped with the responsibility of anticipating every possible use case. Ideally, software would be some sort of &ldquo;universal clay&rdquo;, molded as desired.\nWhile this is a vague end result, there is a clearer step towards it: the reduction of the huge gap between &ldquo;development&rdquo; and &ldquo;use&rdquo; of any given software tool. This has already been done &ldquo;in the large&rdquo;, in the form of the PC; it is natural to expect that this can be extended all the way down.\n\n2. Related work\n\n\n\nMy interests here follow two strands: meta-circularity, and alternatives to plain text. I have already made some practical investigations in both of these areas.\nMeta-circularity\nMeta-circular languages claim to be implemented &ldquo;in themselves&rdquo;. This means that there is considerable freedom to alter syntax and semantics without the usual &ldquo;stepping up the toolchain ladder&rdquo;, but instead in the same source code or runtime environment being used.\nThe paper [OROM] demonstrates a minimal object system called &ldquo;Id&rdquo;, of 3 object types and 5 methods, which can be used to extend…",

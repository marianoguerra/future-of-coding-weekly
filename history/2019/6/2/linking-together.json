                "text": "Archy is a software system whose user interface poses a radically different approach for interacting with computers with respect to traditional graphical user interfaces. Designed by human-computer interface expert Jef Raskin, it embodies his ideas and established results about human-centered design described in his book The Humane Interface.  These ideas include content persistence, modelessness, a nucleus with commands instead of applications, navigation using incremental text search, and a zooming user interface (ZUI).  The system was being implemented at the Raskin Center for Humane Interfaces under Raskin's leadership. Since his death in February 2005 the project was continued by his team, which later shifted focus to the Ubiquity extension for the Firefox browser.\nArchy in large part builds on Raskin's earlier work with the Apple Macintosh, Canon Cat, SwyftWare, and Ken Perlin's Pad ZUI system. It can be described as a combination of Canon Cat's text processing functions with a modern ZUI.  Archy is more radically different from established systems than are Sun Microsystems' Project Looking Glass and Microsoft Research's \"Task Gallery\" prototype. While these systems build upon the WIMP desktop paradigm, Archy has been compared as similar to the Emacs text editor, although its design begins from a clean slate.\nArchy used to be called The Humane Environment (\"THE\").  On January 1, 2005, Raskin announced the new name, and that Archy would be further developed by the non-profit Raskin Center for Humane Interfaces. The name \"Archy\" is a play on the Center's acronym, R-CHI.  It is also an allusion to Don Marquis' archy and mehitabel poetry. Jef Raskin jokingly stated: \"Yes, we named our software after a bug.\" (a cockroach), further playing with the meaning of bugs in software.",

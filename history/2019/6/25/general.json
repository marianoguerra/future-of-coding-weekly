In current Unix-like operating systems, there's a big difference in how data is represented in RAM, vs how it is represented on disk (files, directories). With NVRAM, you could unify these representations.

        "text": "<@UK69SS8LB> GPUs support data-parallel computing. This is a powerful paradigm for general purpose computing. If you have thousands, or tens of thousands of processing units for each gigabyte of memory, that might be a more scalable and efficient architecture, a better way to allocate your transistor budget. HP's \"The Machine\" project proposed to \"bring processing closer to the data\", and that's what GPUs do when you have thousands of cores and gigabytes of memory on the same chip. (Although the HP material doesn't talk about GPUs explicitly.) There have been many research projects that investigated scalable, massively parallel computing, with huge numbers of cores, each having local memory. The advantage of GPUs is that every personal computer has one (I'm including cell phones in my definition of personal computer).\n\nCurrently, GPUs are difficult to program, the standard APIs are quite terrible. High level language support for data-parallel computing is quite limited. Conventional programming languages and libraries push you to use idioms that don't map well to data-parallel computing. So there are all these barriers that inhibit more widespread use of GPU capabilities, and I see a lot of wasted potential. Because of these barriers, GPUs are only used for a few specialized applications, like graphics and machine learning. If these barriers could be removed, via better languages and libraries, then GPUs and data-parallel programming might come to be used in a more general and pervasive way. GPU manufacturers will respond by designing GPU hardware to be more general purpose (eg, like the way they are currently responding to the rise of machine learning). That could eventually lead to more GPU-centric operating systems.",

It is free software, previously released under the GNU General Public License, and  now released under the Apache License 2.0. It is inspired by a PIM from the 1980s called Lotus Agenda, notable because of its \"free-form\" approach to information management. Lead developer of Agenda, Mitch Kapor, was also involved in the vision and management of Chandler.\nChandler consisted of a cross-platform desktop application (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux), the Chandler Hub Sharing Service, Chandler Server, Chandler Quick Entry for iPhone, and Chandler Quick Entry for Android. Version 1.0 of the software was released on August 8, 2008.Chandler was developed by the Open Source Applications Foundation (OSAF). It is named after the mystery novelist Raymond Chandler.Chandler is also the subject of the non-fiction book Dreaming in Code: Two Dozen Programmers, Three Years, 4732 Bugs, and One Quest for Transcendent Software by Scott Rosenberg.",

Sure, there will always be some mathy ideas in there and we can always extract some maths from it, but thinking that computers are 'machines that do math' reduces them quite a bit.\n\nIt's like if you had absolute knowledge of all maths and nothing else, could you design or create the biological world? The powerful ideas in biology are in the phenomena outside maths. Maths (or even physics) doesn't help in designing these phenomena, even though they don't violate any 'laws of physics'. In my perspective the design of computing 'phenomena' are a similar endeavour.",

I've been following his work for a while and have created a web-based version of an MFM simulator. You can find it at <https:\/\/mfm.rocks> and <https:\/\/github.com\/walpolea\/MFM-JS\/>. Development happens in fits and starts, but if there are any web-folk interested in hacking on it, would be happy to have you! The eventual goal is to provide a hands-on way to expose folks to the MFM, by being able to write elements and deploy them at runtime, possibly save and share them as well. But for now there are just a bunch of my own element experiments up there.",

        "text": "I'm really struggling with Conal's FRP — building systems as compositions of continuous functions — functions that take and return real (that is: infinitely precise) numbers.\n\nI'm building a visual programming language where the semantics of the language depend on the measurements of the lengths of lines. The language is live, and reflective (in that code can be self-modifying), and allows for evaluation both forward and backward in time. Determinism is very important.\n\nIn this Twitter thread, I outline a problem — <https:\/\/twitter.com\/spiralganglion\/status\/1143704642997506049> — How can I compare the lengths of lines, deterministically, without resorting to discrete values? If I use some sort of alternative representation (eg: a function that, when evaluated, produces a value for comparison), how do I do it without running smack into the halting problem?\n\nI'd love it if folks could weigh-in on this.",

They might — though I kinda doubt this — be derivatives, or some other non closed-form expression that can't be evaluated finitely.\n\nSo if I'm going to represent them using constructible reals, or some other constructible representation, I would want it to be able to subject to the same sorts of manipulation as regular old numbers.\n\nAnd that might be impossible! If so, I'm curious to learn what the limit is. Which lattice, which ring, which semigroup, which manifold, which orbifold (throwing out mostly inappropriate math terms at this point for comedic effect).. encompasses the viable solution space?\n\nAnd that might be impractical! If so, how the fuck are we programmers expected to actually implement FRP for things that go beyond \"I made some JPGs spin in circles\" and actually approximate the complexity of a modern video game?",

Even the final products of any programming - buttons that push, windows that move, pictures that can be cropped, shipped around etc. - are all virtual objects. People don't want pure functions, they want their computers to have state and be able to manipulate it.\n\nPeople also want see changes what is have been made, go back in history and undo things. In general: reason about mutations. It's a bit ironic that systems that are pro mutation have actually much harder time to reason about them. Those aspects are therefore currently under shipped in real world products.",

Far from it. We are taking a position on the semantics of expressions in high level programming languages. I think there might be some confusion around what claims are being made. Maybe the issues can be clarified with a slight change in terminology. How about \"SMS semantics\" or \"SMS expression semantics\" instead. Some researchers making these claims might use the term \"imperative semantics\", but I don't like that, it's too broad. My research project is a pure functional language that supports (a growing subset of) imperative style programming, but doesn't have SMS semantics.\n\nOf course computers and programs have state that changes over time, but languages with SMS semantics are maybe not the best tools for dealing with state. SMS languages are based on an idealized model of computation where computers have a single core, there is a global memory store where all words of memory have the same cost of access, and there is no networking. That worked well in the past, but not today. Once these assumptions are violated, the model breaks down. The canonical example of the failure of SMS semantics is multithreaded programming. The simple, obvious extension of SMS to support concurrency is shared memory with locks, and that is a nightmare to program with. One response is to patch and extend SMS to work around the problems. Rust supports safe concurrent programming, but at a large cost in language complexity. Another response is to look for simpler, more powerful alternatives to SMS, and that's what some of us in the Future Of Coding group are doing.",

A variant was outlined in \"Out of the Tar Pit\" as \"Functional Relational Programming\".\n\nThe model is incredibly simple: _just take a state and transform it to the next state using a clean declarative rule\/transformation\/rewrite\/function\/reduction_.\n\nThis can be done in parallel as long as you manage partitions of the state per thread.",

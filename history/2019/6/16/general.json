At the systems level, there's functional reactive programming for user interfaces, but it's much less mainstream. It doesn't sound impossible to extend this idea to a complete system, but has it been done?",

        "text": "In shared-mutable-state languages, functions can have side effects. What this means is: there is a global pool of shared mutable state, and any function call can implicitly modify any part of the global state. The key is \"implicitly\". This behaviour doesn't have to be encoded in the function's type, and you are not required to pass an argument to the function indicating what state it has access to.\n\nIn a pure functional language, there are no side effects. Instead, all data dependencies are explicit. To transform a piece of state, you pass the state as an argument to a function, it transforms the state, and returns the modified state as a result. (As <@UE6EFEPTQ> mentioned a few posts ago.)\n\n<@UJBAJNFLK>: I haven't researched pure functional operating systems. However, I think they would be based on [capabilities](<https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Capability-based_security>). You don't want to put all of your operating system state into a single undifferentiated pool. You want to partition this state into small pieces, and reference them using capabilities. The functional equivalent of a system call would consume one or more capabilities as arguments, modify state referenced by those capabilities, then return zero or more capabilities as results. By \"consume\", I mean that capabilities would be non-copyable, and once a capability is consumed, the program no longer has access to it. A typical system call would consume a capability, modify the state referenced by the capability, then return a new capability that references the updated state.",

                "text": "Capability-based security is a concept in the design of secure computing systems, one of the existing security models. A capability (known in some systems as a key) is a communicable, unforgeable token of authority. It refers to a value that references an object along with an associated set of access rights. A user program on a capability-based operating system must use a capability to access an object. Capability-based security refers to the principle of designing user programs such that they directly share capabilities with each other according to the principle of least privilege, and to the operating system infrastructure necessary to make such transactions efficient and secure. Capability-based security is to be contrasted with an approach that uses hierarchical protection domains.\nAlthough most operating systems implement a facility which resembles capabilities, they typically do not provide enough support to allow for the exchange of capabilities among possibly mutually untrusting entities to be the primary means of granting and distributing access rights throughout the system. A capability-based system, in contrast, is designed with that goal in mind.\nCapabilities as discussed in this article should not be confused with POSIX 1e\/2c \"Capabilities\". The latter are coarse-grained privileges that cannot be transferred between processes.",

        "text": "<@UHDQ62M4P> yes what to fix is very context dependent, but I don't think it's hard to discover. I suppose time lost depends on how fast it compiles and runs, and how many other things need fixing. E.g. in Python with no compile time, if I change a function and run a test which takes &lt;1s, I get immediate feedback on the argument mismatch, but only for the code path actually hit. I can fix these and run my current test scenario to see how it actually works.\n\nOne other pattern is sometimes you fix things just to appease the compiler. E.g if a function takes a new param, it may need some work to figure out the right value to pass in at each call site. One is tempted to just pass in a `0` or default value in many places 'to make the compiler pass' with the idea that these will be dealt with later - because again, one's context at this moment is the current test only. All the compiler appeasement does is move the problem outside what the compiler can track.\n\nI do think in the end this pattern depends a lot on the kind of project and working style you have. I think this is a bigger problem in larger code bases, because you have more things to fix up for any change.",

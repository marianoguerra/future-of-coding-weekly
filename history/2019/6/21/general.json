Nowadays with gigantic memory stores, worrying about how big a box to store is of minor importance for 99% of programs, and so the real benefit is about reducing programmer error. Most of the time spent programming is fixing errors, and anything that helps reduce programmer error should be encouraged. What does it mean to multiply PI by \"hello\"? if you can catch an error at compile time, it eliminates the potentially crazy result that the computer might generate from an operation like PI * \"hello\".",

        "text": "Back before Swift, the top reason why apps submitted to the App Store got rejected was crashes on launch and during the short period the app would be looked at during review. Most of these crashes were caused by simple programming errors that are easy to make in (Objective-)C: forgotten nil-checks and type mismatch. Turns out many developers never test their apps at all, and never run them on a device (only in the simulator).\n\nNot the most obvious way to solve this problem, and certainly not the easiest way, was to introduce a language with a stronger type system that would flag these problems at compile time.\n\nIf you can choose between (a) trust developers that they learn what they need to learn, write their tests, and ship quality software, or (b) build an infrastructure that categorically makes such errors impossible, a rather large company chose to go with (b). And the top reason for rejections now is App Completeness, basically an app doesn’t do everything the marketing description says it does.\n\nA lot of Objective-C developers complain about how they lose flexibility with Swift in hacking something together quickly because they have to satisfy the type system, that the compiler diagnostics aren’t always helpful, and compile times are much longer. These are all valid criticisms and part of the trade-off, but also things that are being addressed and will likely only get better in the future.\n\nIf you’re interested in a less academic and very practical and business-oriented environment where a transition from dynamic to static typing is taking place right at this moment, Swift and iOS development are an interesting case study to look at.\n\nAlso interesting: the effects this has on API design for libraries and frameworks — after five years Apple just released the first Swift-only frameworks designed to take advantage of Swift’s unique features. The new Swift APIs are fundamentally different from the old Objective-C ones: favoring composition, value types over reference types, static over dynamic, protocols over inheritance hierarchies, etc. — it’s super interesting to see the design, and the feedback. Of course, not everybody is happy with such change. And it’s a big bet on a (more type-safe) future and nobody knows how it’ll work out…",

It's hard to glance at it, see the hype from Apple devs, and not feel like they were stuck in ObjC land for 15 years and never used anything else. Their hype about Swift seem so out of touch the last 15+ years of non-apple dev.\n\nAre there any blog posts with like \"I use to love C# but then I touched Swift and it's 1000% better. I can't believe I ever used anything else!\" type of posts with some concrete \"this is what used to have to do and look now! 75% less code and all these bugs avoided!\"\n\nI'm sure the new tools make an amazng system but those tools are not impossible for many other languages so what's so special about the language itself?",

But being blunt, studies don't find less bugs programs written in static languages.\n\nIf haskell was hands down safer then clojure, purely based on types, then shouldn't it have shown? Instead the opposite is found. \n\nMany other factors seem to be at play. I think it's perfect possibly to build a language that has the checks you just mentioned and keep it dynamic  in that devs aren't responsible for specifying types.\n\nIf academics and type theory pureist are going to stand on a hill and discard other approaches isn't it responsible and reasonable to demand some form of proof beyond anecdotal stories.\n\nI think I would have more patience for these things if the tone of the conversation was more academic in nature. Again, that's my fault, I need to take the time to learn the principles and terminology so I can have a more meaningful conversation.\n\nFinally, I'm not interested in what works at the lowest common denominator (people unwilling to test) that's not the future of programming for me. That race to the bottom type argument, more then anything, is what drives me away.",

So far I haven't seen what that is with Swift. Everything brought up seems old (but presented as new hence my bad reaction). But maybe Swift is the perfect recipe so like a fine chef makes something special out of the same ingredients others have only made bland meals. I just wish it was easier to see by reading about it.\n\nAgree 100% with the general premise that a language can make certain problems less likely and possibly just disappear.

        "text": "Thanks for the link! Mixing the history with the garbage collector is an interesting technique, I've been working on sorting out memory reachability in my own language (it doesn't have a GC), and getting something optimal has been tricky.\n\nThe thing I'm building sits somewhere between a language and a runtime. Build systems like CMake and Bazel run 'programs' as directed acyclic graphs of pure, deterministic functions. There are a certain limited set of programs that can be created with this structure. The concept of this new language is to extend this framework to non-finite programs, such that a 'program' is a Directed Acyclic Infinite Graph (DAIG?).\n\nMy theory is that this infinite graph representation of programs is general enough to represent a large number of different types of applications (currently the language targets game development).\n\nThe key benefit of this approach is that even though the graph is infinite, all operations are pure, deterministic, and singular (they only need to compute once and the value is permanent). Debugging becomes the process of sifting through this infinite graph of operations, and inspecting the outputs of various operations. Running the 'program' is just the choice to evaluate different nodes in the infinite graph at a certain schedule (ie. show me the frame 1 output, then frame 2, etc).",

For one, as computers grow in ability, we simply want to do more complex things with them. Give programmers space, and they will fill it up until things get slow. A more efficient language gives more room to grow. More deeply, a faster language can be said to be more \"high level\" than a slower language since the programmer doesn't need to worry about performance consequences so much. My simple, brute force C++ algorithm may be smaller, simpler and faster than your complex Python algorithm :slightly_smiling_face:",

There are some great stories in the earlier days of computing where people were creating hardware implementations of VM’s to be able to efficiently run high level languages (like smalltalk, etc). This removes some of the false dichotomy around high level and low level languages. Ultimately, you just want good speed and decent control and if you can get that with a HLL and a good hardware VM … well!\n\nThis also meant when the floodgates to commercialization opened, microcomputers with cheaper hardware dominated and didn’t support these higher level languages (since the custom hardware was often quite pricey to make languages like smalltalk work quickly).\n\n*disclaimer: this is all my understanding from stories \/ hearsay from talks. Would def love more references to this kinda stuff*",

While managed languages don't have to worry about issues like aliasing in C++, so in theory they could be faster, in practice they never go that far. The levels to which a compiler like LLVM can collapse both code and data in C++ to almost nothing is crazy, nothing in the managed world compares. Languages like Java have their own optimisation challenges, e.g. as soon as escape analysis fails it gets very inefficient.",

The majority of apps in the world run in JavaScript in browsers or webviews which fits the description of \"99% of programs\". Maybe quibble with 99% to just \"the majority of programs\"\n\nI'm a game programmer so I generally hate inefficiency and am super sensitive to how inefficient things are but here I am in this app called slack that is written in JavaScript (the client side at least) running in a browser on my desktop or a webview on my phone. I use gmail, google docs, google sheets, all the time. I use VSCode also written in a browser in JavaScript. The majority of games today are written in managed C# (Unity) so while it's true we could get 5x to 25x more efficiency if we used the right techniques it still seems true that for \"most software\" those things don't matter.",

What does it mean to multiply PI by \"hello\"?\n\nThat doesn't fit my experience _in the slightest_. Most of my time spent programming is figuring out the design of my system. The most time-costly class of \"error\" would be uncertainty about what exactly I want to build, which manifests as building something experimentally, playing with it, realizing it's not quite what I want, repeat. For instance, types can't help me decide if I want to implement my graphics library using SVG or WebGL.\n\nSure I make errors — we all do — but I discover almost all of them almost immediately, and they're trivial to fix. Something like PI multiplied by \"hello\" isn't nearly as nefarious as \"I misunderstood the linear algebra and now I'm getting weird looking results when I convert a rotation into a skew+scale\", which I don't believe a typical type system can help with.",

        "text": "One morass I repeatedly see conversations fall into is trying to make generalizations about \"programming\". The discussion about \"most time spent programming\" is like this. And also the discussion of static vs dynamic types above. Programming is a huge field! Indeed, as it eats everything it's better seen as an aspect of all fields of endeavor. Like reading. Or history. Try to make a valid statement about \"most time spent performing arithmetic\", and hopefully it's clear how silly such statements are about programming.\n\nWhat we should be focusing on is _domains_. Games require very different languages and libraries and processors from scientific simulations, compilers have their own requirements. Even the category of \"web app\" is huge, because web apps can do many things. I work on deployment tools in my day job, and the domain has certain properties whether you create commandline tools or GUIs or web apps. (We've done them all.)\n\nThe challenge of end-user programming isn't to figure out the smallest set of things people need. I promise you programming will overflow any box you put it into. No, we have to meet people half-way in each domain separately.",

        "text": "&gt; rather than local RAM bit fiddling optimizers\n\n&gt; you will always need the latter\n\nAgree, but I'm saying that it could be much simpler than millions of LOC and the C++ language spec without cost.\n\n&gt; This LLVM level optimization you so dislike controls 99% of data center costs\n\nYes, I'm well aware. But also looking at how much proxying, redundant encoding\/decoding, RPC fan-out and model duplication happens across all the services, it seems we're losing a lot as well.\n\nI don't dislike LLVM, I think it's pretty solid. I'm arguing for exploring a different model starting top-down. Not just LLVM but all language runtimes\/compilers come from a world where 'process' meant OS\/Unix process (maybe your whole world was a single OS instance). But processes in large scale systems are very different and we're kind of hacking them on top as a separate layer.\n\n&gt; I guess I personally prefer to work on designs I can implement myself, today :slightly_smiling_face: Maybe I'm conservative?\n\nWhy not do both? :smile:",

We can choose to retain as much detail as we need to still state things meaningfully.\n\n• The amount of time people spend on various kinds of programming tasks is measurable, and has been measured, both broadly (across languages, skill levels, domains) and narrowly (within a language, skill level, domain).\n\n• Our gut intuitions about such matters are, more often than not, worth listening to. Especially when discussing things in a group, sharing and challenging our collective intuitions.\n\n• Totally agree about needing to focus on domains. That's a great way to carve up the space, to decrease the abstractness of our discussions. But we can also achieve similar carvings-up other ways — and one such way is saying, \"Let's look at the spectrum\/space of static to dynamic and see what clusterings of ideas we can place in that space\"",

I think it flips once you have to interact with code that isn't in your own short-term memory; or change a previously-made decision. Strong types tell you immediately which pieces don't fit, which is a hard (sometimes intractable) problem if you don't have the entirety of the software in your head.\n\nI'll reiterate what I've said in another thread, which is that \"labelling types\" is a task that I think the machine should do, not the programmer. It's currently a burden on the programmer, because the compiler has basically no control over what text is appearing in the programmer's editor. A language (i.e. a visual one) where the editor and the compiler are the same software could plausibly take over this task and relieve the burden on the programmer.",

Now I've started learning about free monads and those seem like a possible answer. There's a new Haskell library called polysemy which (ostensibly) finally makes free monads workable in Haskell (boilerplate wise and performance wise). Does Conal address free monads?",

        "text": "<https:\/\/www.joelonsoftware.com\/2002\/05\/06\/five-worlds\/>\n\nAs an example AFAIK git has not made much inroads into AAA game dev as it's horrible for large files and horrible for helping to deal with non mergeable binary assets. Not really a programming thing but I suspect the majority of programmers take git as a given now-a-days. It's not and the problems it doesn't solve seem mostly ignored outside of game dev.\n\nAnother example of a difference for many AAA game devs, they fill up ram. I've shipped games where I often needed to change jumps (3 bytes) into unconditional branches (2 bytes) so I could squeeze in a bug fix. Maybe not a good example. I've shipped games that used all but 2k of all available ram and for example had to put all data in one file to prevent the OS from allocating more memory opening multiple files. Many languages are lax at memory management and so either are not appropriate or else my app will get xx% less features\/level size\/texture detail since I need to keep xx% of ram free for the language to play with.\n\nAnother example might be loading binary files. AFAIK most executable loaders load the executable straight into memory, fix up some pointers and then execute it where as most language level serialization libraries load some intermediate representation into memory, then parse that building language native objects from the representation. Plenty of games though use the executable style. Load the data, fix up pointers, use the data in place. They don't have space to have things in memory twice, once in an intermediate format and again in a language native format. But most languages don't support that at all (one arguable advantage of C\/C++) for certain domains.",

There was a game engine written in C# though, XNA, and plenty of games shipped with it.\n\nIn any case we optimize the parts that are too slow. Tons of scientists use python and numpy to do science. Does the fact that their python code would use less memory and run faster mean they should be programming in assembly language instead? No, they get stuff done by using what they consider to be a productive language, python, and having it call out to custom more optimized solutions when they need to (numpy). This is arguably the same for most apps. They don't need ultimate efficiency. In fact I'd argue if they prioritized efficiency of CPU execution and efficiency of memory they'd lose on efficiency of developer time which would effectively make software less useful. Lowering developer efficiency means less features, less bug fixes, etc...",

Where I find tools lacking is on the other side of the spectrum: the big picture. For instance, know what code is using a function\/method, creating visual maps of symbols and traversing their relations. These are all super useful when working at the architectural level, but there's very little support for that. UML2.0 tried to do that, but approached it from the wrong end (model-&gt;code), while in practice the code-&gt;model is closer to how we work in practice.",

This is something very natural, which we learn from childhood: grammar, alphabet, syntax, etc. It is not a limitation of the text-terminal era - it is a natural way to express things. Some people even argue this is hardcoded in our brains (see Universal Grammar). So when thinking about visual programming, I wonder if there is an example of the successful sohphisticated visual environment for expressing complex ideas, comparable to human language. Technical drawing? Circuit schematics? Given a few decades of attempts to develop a visual programming environment I am yet to see the one which would impress me. Most of the attempts fall under the category \"making simple things easy but complex things impossible\". I do not want to discourage anybody from trying to work in this direction, but I want to make a point that \"text\" in languages is not a legacy limitation from mainframe times.",

                "text": "WinFS (short for Windows Future Storage) was the code name for a canceled data storage and management system project based on relational databases, developed by Microsoft and first demonstrated in 2003 as an advanced storage subsystem for the Microsoft Windows operating system, designed for persistence and management of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.\nWinFS includes a relational database for storage of information, and allows any type of information to be stored in it, provided there is a well defined schema for the type. Individual data items could then be related together by relationships, which are either inferred by the system based on certain attributes or explicitly stated by the user. As the data has a well defined schema, any application can reuse the data; and using the relationships, related data can be effectively organized as well as retrieved. Because the system knows the structure and intent of the information, it can be used to make complex queries that enable advanced searching through the data and aggregating various data items by exploiting the relationships between them.\n\nWhile WinFS and its shared type schema make it possible for an application to recognize the different data types, the application still has to be coded to render the different data types. Consequently, it would not allow development of a single application that can view or edit all data types; rather, what WinFS enables applications to do is understand the structure of all data and extract the information that they can use further. When WinFS was introduced at the 2003 Professional Developers Conference, Microsoft also released a video presentation, named IWish, showing mockup interfaces that showed how applications would expose interfaces that take advantage of a unified type system. The concepts shown in the video ranged from applications using the relationships of items to dynamically offer filtering options to applications grouping multiple related data types and rendering them in a unified presentation.\nWinFS was billed as one of the pillars of the \"Longhorn\" wave of technologies, and would ship as part of the next version of Windows.  It was subsequently decided that WinFS would ship after the release of Windows Vista, but those plans were shelved in June 2006, with some of its component technologies being integrated into <http:\/\/ADO.NET|ADO.NET> and Microsoft SQL Server.",

How do you embed a photo in your journal? The filesystem answer is export\/import and you end up with two copies with no record of the relationship. The WinFS answer is that the journal app can just reach into the db and link directly to the photo *item*. Now you can find uses (\"where is this photo used?\"), enforce policy (\"don't let app A use any photos labelled X\") and have updates to the photo (possibly via a third photo editor app) automatically flow to the journal.",

        "text": "IOW, it's not the RDBMS that makes this interesting, it's that the OS provides a way to express rich linking between artifacts and these links are available for generic tooling. I see the hierarchical filesystem as also providing *one* way to express links via *directory containment*. Consider how many generic tools make great use of this feature:\n\nmv dir1 dir2  # Move *all* files in ..\nzip dir1  # compress *all* files in ..\nrm dir1  # delete ...\nfind dir1 -name '*txt' | xargs grep 'hello'  # search all files in ...\n\nCompare with an imaginary OS that only provides flat key\/value, no directories: you can implement directories on top of key\/value by storing them as value blobs, but they're not visible via a uniform interface since each app invents its own formats. So you can't have the powerful generic commands like above. Moving on this continuum in the other direction, we have an OS where richer interlinks than just 'directory containment' are available. This seems fundamentally different in what in enables. I don't think of this as more pure, but rather more aware of the relationships between artifacts. Perhaps more powerful generic tools  become possible:\n\nzip all_dependencies_of(some_file)\nlocate sources_for(some_binary)\nfind linked_from(my_journal, all_images())\netc.",

        "text": "WinFS was Microsoft's copy of the original Apple File System from System 7, which had the concept of a file containing unstructured data (the data fork), and then a 2 level hierarchical database of structured data (the resource fork). When Apple invented the resource fork, it solved a huge problem that had plagued computer systems, which was that you wanted to add metadata to a file, maybe a custom icon, or a set of preferences for the program, or maybe some login info; and you wanted to guarantee that the meta data travelled with the other data without being separated or lost. It was a brilliant system, and allowed Apple OS to have far fewer files, and not have hidden names with dot in front like Unix uses. It was considered one of the greatest innovations of the Apple OS. However, when the internet got going, and people started doing FTP of files, the resource fork, which could not be represented well on the intermediate Linux servers would get corrupted\/mangled\/stripped. So Apple discontinued using resource forks in OSX, and no longer uses any resource forks in their programs, instead using a fake folder system for applications for example, where the OS presents a folder as an App. Microsoft took so many years to implement WinFS, because they took it way further than Apple, that people forgot it inspiration, as Microsoft was not content with a mere clone of the simplistic Apple system, and created a huge complex and powerful system. However, they saw that Apple dropped their multilevel file system, and scuttled WinFS. I think Bill Gates commented that he regretted that they wimped out on this change, and i think from a purely technical standpoint it would have been wonderful, but let's face it, the 50 year old Linux file system is a millstone around everyone's neck, and bucking it isn't easy, because Linux must be 90% of all web servers, and Linux releases are mostly rehashes of different versions of thousands of components, and the core system changes like a glacier. The Apple system came with a program called ResEdit, which allowed you to register a four letter code for your resource type, and add in a editor for it to that program, and you could share your editor modules, and by having all the companies register ownership of a 4 letter code, they created a whole ecosystem of custom data editors. This approach has been promoted recently by the guy that invented Macromedia director, but without manufacturer support this type of cooperation never gets off the ground. There is no question in my mind that a standardized data type registry with shareable editors could revolutionize access to data. Too much of our data is stored in unshareable, uneditable format. Our code at least has a textual form, and if you stay within the same language there is tons of code you can borrow, but data is stuck more or less in the era of .csv files, as a spreadsheet is the dominant data storage mechanism, as there is little standardization in databases, and transfer between databases is always problematic. A lot of companies make a healthy living converting data between formats.",

The top 10 languages in common use which are Excel, JS, Java, Swift, etc., are not visual, so really a VPL has a double acceptance problem, which is 1) introducing a new language, and 2) changing how you use a language (point and click, drag and drop) versus editing text and pressing RUN.  Visual programming language projects like Luna are not having an easy time. I have great sympathy for people willing to throw their work into the meat grinder that is public opinion, which is governed by the most powerful force in the universe which is inertia. (i know that Inertia is not technically a force in physics, but in the human realm, inertia acts as a force, and like centrifugal force can be considered a virtual force).",

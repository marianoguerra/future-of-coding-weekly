It was invented by a man far too smart for his own good, and blessed with a prodigious memory, he could hold in his head the precedence and left-to-right or right-to-left priority of all his operators. A more ordinary mind is constantly getting snared in APL's traps, where you don't understand how many operators are doing what in what direction.",

Humans are really good at this (but not even close to perfect). Computers aren't good at dealing with ambiguities (and I'd argue they shouldn't have to deal with ambiguities at all). Because programs stored as text are ambiguous (e.g. \"Which version of Python does this script require?\", \"Where do I find the library 'numpy'? And what version do I need?\"), we invented a whole bunch of bolt-on tools (e.g. dependency management) and rules so that our programs become less ambiguous.\n\nIt's clear that these ambiguities need to be resolved, but we can choose when to do that. I'd argue that it should happen as soon as possible. For example, your editor should know that you write Python 3.7 by default and encode that in the storage representation unless you specify something else. The representation shared between people should be unambiguous.\n\nThink of it like talking to a (human) assistant. If you tell them \"Please call Mary and tell her that Tom wants to meet her at 8PM\", the assistant would probably ask which 'Tom' you meant and would assume that the time was referring to your current time zone. Using the additional information, the assistant could inform Mary (assuming that 'Mary' is unambiguous). If they'd just do the call (without asking for clarification), Mary would have to guess the exact meaning of 'Tom' and the time.\n\nIn programming we're guessing and working around ambiguity issues all the time and I wonder if another storage representation could solve this.",

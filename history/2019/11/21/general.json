Productivity is usually defined as efficiency of production (<https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Productivity>). So it takes you less some to do something. What you do with the time you saved is not dictated here, whether you choose to do more things or go chill.\n\nIn any case, I admit I wasn't attending that closely to the wording, just the dichotomy between scratching your own itch and building something others would use. Now that I think about it, even there I'm not airtight. I'm sure there are people who just want to scratch their own itch. But I think anybody trying to build something for others here is _also_ trying to scratch their own itch.",

By \"increase my productivity\", I merely meant that I'd like to make cool things in less time. Although in retrospect, inventing a new programming language was an odd way to go about increasing my productivity.\n\nI think that the real story is: I was looking for an interesting and challenging new project, right at the limits of my ability to accomplish it, because I hate being bored. I also wanted something tangible to show for all my efforts at the end, so downloading and playing videogames was ruled out."

That is, 1) helping lots of folks do things they’d like to vs 2) helping oneself or a few to vs 3) exploring ideas mainly for reasons other than usefulness, such as novelty. Though we tend to talk about the differences between 1 &amp; 2, I suspect it’s not uncommon to find oneself (as I did) doing 3.",

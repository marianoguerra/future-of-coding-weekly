So I believe you'll enjoy these two podcast episodes as much as I did.\n\nFirst up, the fantastic Internet History Podcast devoted an episode to the abridged biography of Claude Shannon, often dubbed the \"Father of Information Theory\", though he certainly was a more interesting character than the title may convey. If you haven't heard of _information theory,_ they do a nice job of hinting at the grandness of the idea in this episode. What I didn't know, though, was just how diverse and charming a character Shannon was. His life and personality don't exactly lend themselves to being biographed (biographized?), but his accomplishments sure do. This episode is a delight, and cements Shannon as a scientific figure of equal stature and historic interest as Feynman and Turing. (And, for that matter, the entire archive of the Internet History Podcast is _golden_. Highly recommended.) <http:\/\/www.internethistorypodcast.com\/2018\/05\/claude-shannon-father-of-information-theory\/>\n\nNext, the podcast Art + Music + Technology interviewed the creator of Max\/MSP and Pure Data, Miller Puckette. Folks who know me know that I'm a visual programming ~nutjob~ zealot, so take my word (if necessary) that these projects are seminal works in the field of visual programming. Thanks to this interview, I've now learned that Miller's focus in creating them was in a very different place than I would have imagined. He didn't seem to think much at all about what the visual character of the languages should be, and instead was far more interested in the way that the underlying engine served as a scheduler, taking after Max Matthews (naturally). In addition to the stories of Max and Pure Data, there's a lot of interesting discussion about the early history of computer music, and they even happen to gush about my very favorite textbook (<https:\/\/mitpress.mit.edu\/books\/designing-sound>). For anyone interested in this particular slice of history, or fond of computer music, I recommend this episode. <https:\/\/artmusictech.libsyn.com\/podcast-090-miller-puckette>",

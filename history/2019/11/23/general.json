When I say “creator”, I don’t mean just me or other developers. I mean everyone on the planet who wants to create things with computers.\n\nI’d guess most people’s common desires would be focused on communication and roughly be described as ways of creating and sharing professional quality interactive documents, which seems worlds apart from the typical FoC demos focused on helping existing developers with  code editor or debugger features.",

I’ve found an incredible diversity, even though they have fairly consistent goals. This post is an attempt to find common patterns, to characterize the design space as a whole. It will be rough, at some points almost a stream of consciousness. If I had the time and energy, I think it could be expanded into an academic paper. But, for now, perhaps these rough thoughts are interesting to some people working in the space.",

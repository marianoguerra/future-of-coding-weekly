        "text": "\nSure, if 1. is the case it’s no problem I’m happy, the original abstraction is reused I don’t feel so bad, “it did worth it!“. But usually this is not the part I am afraid of. And also my point is, that it is only matter of time when reuse won’t be possible with these updated abstractions and I must just dump. Requirements changed so much and IN SUCH A WAY + IN SUCH AN ORDER, it is just literally EASIER to dump the existing (layers) of abstractions to get to the goal.\n\nAnother point: knowing this happens all the time it feels wrong to think a lot about “complicated” abstractions which will help me in future. Earlier, I thought it is not a problem to sit and think a lot about these “partially good abstractions”, because I thought they will be useful. Also, reusing these “half baked” solutions seemed OK and justifiable. Now it feels like chasing a shadow and betting too much on catching it.\n\n2.(b): it happens, I am OK with it.\n\nBut here is the worst point:\n2.(a): getting rid of the old abstraction(s).\n\nIt is insanely hard! And it is weird why it is… Entangled code, changed meanings! Ill-evolved abstractions both in test and in production code! Whaaat?! I think that is the part we should do something about.\n\n“Half baked abstractions” feel like boundaries for safety (code reuse is also safety: “not to forget this case”-safety). But boundaries are rigid. It feels to me a “Sacrificing flexibility for safety”. Sure, abstractions also do have “meaning”, but this meaning alters over time (the dirty part, not the clean part) and sometimes the “stuff” is abstracted away is more like a fast changing “process” without real boundaries and not like an “entity” \/ unit \/ “noun” with clear boundaries. If it was a String its OK, it is a clean abstraction. My problem is with the “intermediate stuff” which are more like steps (which are more likely to change) in a process not a real entity like “AnIdiotAdapterFromXToYAfterZHappenedButBlah”. Abstractions feel declarative and rigid. Lack of abstractions feels imperative and flexible.\n\nSo with all this what I am thinking about is this:\nThe production code should be as flexible (dirty, ugly, duplicated, etc.) as possible, with SHALLOW (layers of) abstractions (shallow not equals low complexity). It feels a bit like “composition over inheritance” aka “fuck and duplicate over using defaults you wont be able to delete later + you have to duplicate later no matter what”.\n\nOn the other hand it seems to be a good idea to have a nice set of integration tests with “full coverage” which tests DO SHARE a lot of abstractions for being able to describe “all the RAW cases”. (By raw I mean no\/less intermediate stuff.)\nMaybe asserting on invariants in tests (and making these asserts reusable in test abstractions) is more maintainable then evolving and maintaining abstractions of production code.\n\nI might be 110% wrong. I am quite sure if I’d do this I’d pray for abstractions I did not introduce … Complexity does this all the time. The reason I feel its something else now is that its not complexity itself which ruins me (and my code) but the ORDER OF STEPS I get there.",

But usually this is not the part I am afraid of. And also my point is, that it is only matter of time when reuse won’t be possible with these updated abstractions and I must just dump. Requirements changed so much and IN SUCH A WAY + IN SUCH AN ORDER, it is just literally EASIER to dump the existing (layers) of abstractions to get to the goal.\n\nAnother point: knowing this happens all the time it feels wrong to think a lot about “complicated” abstractions which will help me in future. Earlier, I thought it is not a problem to sit and think a lot about these “partially good abstractions”, because I thought they will be useful. Also, reusing these “half baked” solutions seemed OK and justifiable. Now it feels like chasing a shadow and betting too much on catching it.\n\n2.(b): it happens, I am OK with it.\n\nBut here is the worst point:\n2.(a): getting rid of the old abstraction(s).\n\nIt is insanely hard! And it is weird why it is… Entangled code, changed meanings! Ill-evolved abstractions both in test and in production code! Whaaat?! I think that is the part we should do something about.\n\n“Half baked abstractions” feel like boundaries for safety (code reuse is also safety: “not to forget this case”-safety). But boundaries are rigid. It feels to me a “Sacrificing flexibility for safety”. Sure, abstractions also do have “meaning”, but this meaning alters over time (the dirty part, not the clean part) and sometimes the “stuff” is abstracted away is more like a fast changing “process” without real boundaries and not like an “entity” \/ unit \/ “noun” with clear boundaries.

As <@UBSMEUXAA> pointed out above, not trusting abstractions seems not so much an extraordinary idea but more just a secret truth that we don't talk about in polite company.\n2. Among hard-core TDD folks there's a school of thought that's the exact opposite of yours: make sure to keep tests entirely devoid of abstraction, to counteract any tendencies for complexity creep and over-abstraction in production code. I subscribe to this idea, though there's always a question of how far to take \"no abstractions\". Do we avoid all standard libraries? Do we skip the language and just program in machine code? My current rule of thumb is that I can use any abstractions from production code, but I am extremely selective about creating test-only abstractions. Since this means production code is often used for test setup, it's very important to be very explicit in each test about the component under test.\n3. Maintaining control over abstractions shouldn't imply avoiding them entirely. Just to 'stay loose' mentally. Any abstraction can be questioned or taken out at any time.\n4. At the risk of repeating myself, you should check out my notion of white-box tests: <http:\/\/akkartik.name\/post\/tracing-tests>. Rather than have tests run sub-components and make assertions on their behavior, I always run the whole program, emitting a trace of domain-specific events (facts deduced by the program), namespaced by different conceptual sub-components. Then different tests make assertions on the state of the trace. Fine-grained unit tests may focus on just traces pertaining to a specific namespace, while coarse-grained integration tests may look at a different namespace. Traces are an abstraction-busting device: tests no longer care about details of _how_ facts are deduced, they only focus on _what_ facts are deduced. And this permits radical changes to abstractions without needing to modify tests.\n5. You should also check out my notion of layers: <http:\/\/akkartik.name\/post\/wart-layers>. Layers are an abstraction-busting device for gradually inserting code tastefully into a skeleton of a program. They're often useful for recapitulating a cleaned-up history of a program's evolution so that newcomers have access to _always working_ copies of earlier, simpler snapshots. One thing I find myself using layers to do is track _alternatives_. When things were simple some sub-system was implemented one way. As features were added the old way got replaced. But it's still really useful for conveying the core idea. I keep the old implementation around in earlier layers, and replace it in later layers. That way the codebase continues to exercise both alternatives rather than let the old way accumulate rust in a git log somewhere.\n\nAnyway, I keep repeating myself about traces and layers, so apologies to those who are sick of hearing about them. But I really think they're super valuable ideas. Certainly they're 2 of the 3 best ideas I've ever had, and I don't expect to add to that list for the rest of my life.",

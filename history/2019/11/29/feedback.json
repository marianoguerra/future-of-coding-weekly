Although it seems like micro examples are the way to build up towards something, i think it just paints you into a corner over and over again. I have seen many attempts to draw flowchart versions of code, but once you get to 100 lines of code, it becomes a big mess, and people aren't having trouble with a 4 way case statement. So my suggestion is take on a bigger example so that you are immediately confronted with the true problem, which is how to improve comprehensibility using the graphical techniques at your disposal.",

Because he did not know how to do user stories.\n\nThe same is true for Microsoft, read Microsoft secrets, they had the same problem and used the same solution back in the 1990's.\n\nHe has a book \"The Mom Test\". I assume he is happy to do an interview in exchange for a plug of the book.\n\nVideo of him talking about the problem and solution. He says you should ask questions about current solutions. <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0LwbFZkyRKk>\n\nNot sure if the topic is right for the pod cast. But feel that the problem he describes and the solution are important to trying to make programming more accessible.",

What’s curious to me is that if you look at any list of projects related to visual programming, almost all (at least IMO) have visual designs that are cluttered and confused and generally break every rule of good design. I’m guessing this is because these are mostly programmers diving into the world of visual design, instead of visual designers getting into programming. Maybe more collaboration from people on both sides would be helpful, but I don’t know if there’s an awareness that these designs need help.",

        "text": "<@ULM3U6275> You’re pretty much describing the situation with mobile apps as well. Tons of developers try to build apps, few work with designers.\n\nYou’re also touching on a related problem: many people think design is just visual aesthetics. That is for sure a part of it, but user experience means a lot more.\n\nNow that most regular people most of the time use pocket-sized supercomputers with touchscreens and all kinds of other sensors, how it feels becomes more important. Animations, fluid transitions, direct manipulation, continuous gestures, physicality, feedback, and integration become more important and will distinguish good design from great design, until what used to be considered good feels broken.\n\nA typical use case for me is having four to six small computers, several of them wearable, on me and actively using them simultaneously. That’s phone, watch, two wireless headphone earpieces, and sometimes a tablet with a pencil all working in concert together. I skip a track by tapping on my watch although the music is actually playing on my phone and streamed to my headphones. The music stops playing when I remove one of the earpieces and continues by just putting it back in. I copy something on my phone and paste it on my tablet or notebook. There's not much visual UI involved, but that’s user experience.\n\nThere is a ton of potential in this kind of integration across devices. But people still discuss whether tablets are going to replace notebooks, like the web will finally make apps obsolete any day now. ;-)",

The execution is fun to watch but when everything flickers you can't tell any patterns. What if everything didn't flicker though? Or if you had a way to only show you the executions that match a specific condition?",

So it's nice to alternate between grouping, say, all the executions of a line of code together and then focusing on one suspicious one.  For me the frustrating thing is that I'll imagine the manipulation of the possibility space of executions in my head, then be forced to slowly and crudely convert that into tools that my debugger can understand.",

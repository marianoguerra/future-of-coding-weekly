This made me ask a different set of questions: 1) What characteristics of spreadsheets are believed to directly contribute to the success of spreadsheets as an end-user programming tool? 2) Has anyone attempted to design a non-spreadsheet-based programming tool by using these characteristics as a roadmap? Regarding question #1, I found this excellent paper at <https:\/\/www.miramontes.com\/writing\/spreadsheet-eup\/>. I haven't found anything else quite like it and was wondering whether anyone here knows of more research like it (I plan to write the authors as well). Regarding question #2, I found lots of projects that explore the programmability of spreadsheet tools, but that's not what I had in mind. Thoughts?",

By looking, the user can tell the state of the device and the alternatives for action.\n* *A good conceptual model*. The designer provides a good conceptual model for the user, with consistency in the presentation of operations and results and a coherent, consistent system image.\n* *Good mappings*. It is possible to determine the relationships between actions and results, between controls and their effects, and between the system state and what is visible.\n* *Feedback*. The user receives full and continuous feedback about the results of actions.\n\nTraditional “typed statement” programming environments live up to none of these criteria. In traditional programming it is often very difficult to determine relationships between operations and results. The feedback is not continuous and because of syntax constraints often a program being modified is not in a state where you can see the results. Systems like spreadsheets are better, since they offer easier to choose alternatives and usually allow you to see the results with just a click, providing a nice feedback loop. Norman concludes that with spreadsheets “it felt as if you were working directly on the problem, not on a computer.”",

Programming in spreadsheets is possible, but spreadsheets don't seem to be very good at nudging people to think about architecture or testing. Design sense and testing feel like essential, timeless mindsets for end-user programming. You _have_ to teach them to get comprehensive end-user programming, and you can't just paper over the cracks with better tooling. The tooling has to support _education_.",

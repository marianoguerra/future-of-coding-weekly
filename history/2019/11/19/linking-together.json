If you subscribe to the theory laid out in those two articles (unsurprisingly, much better in the one by Christopher Alexander), and if you believe that it can be applied to software, how does this change the way you design (as in architect — but that’s not a verb, as Alexander would say) systems?\n\nIn essence one possible conclusion is that we’ve been doing software architecture all wrong for decades, trying to cleanly separate everything into distinct layers or subsystems with as little overlap as possible, modeling everything as a tree, when it should be a semi-lattice.",

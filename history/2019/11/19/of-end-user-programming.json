The only way to teach taste is to create a suitable environment and let people find it in their own time. Forcing when people should do the right thing is motivation-sapping.",

        "text": "After banging my head on a problem at work all day, the answer came to me in a flash of insight on the way home. I spent all day repeatedly running experiments on my program, inserting complex sequences of breakpoints, emitting large traces, gradually refining and automating a whole complex workflow so it could be more easily repeated after making changes to my program. I had more ideas for things to try later in the night, but the insight short-circuited them.\n\nOne voice in my head (the one often active when interacting in this forum) whispers that if only I had better tools the process could have been shortened.\n\nAnother voice in my head whispers that I'm stupid for taking so long to figure out something some putative body else would find obvious. (\"If deleting no-op nodes in a dependency graph causes nodes to fire before they're ready, that means some edges are being spuriously cut.\") Or maybe I'm rusty, because I don't work anymore with graphs 12 years after finishing grad school.\n\nBut the dominant voice in my head is just elation, the flush of insight, of having tamed a small portion of the wilderness around me and inside my own head. And it wouldn't have happened without struggling for a while with the wilderness, no matter what tools I had. A big portion of today was spent trying to visualize graphs and finding them too large for my tools to handle. So I had to resort to progressively more and more precise tools. Text-mode scalpels over graphical assistants. And that process of going beyond what my regular tools can handle is a key characteristic of going out into the wilderness. When tools fail, the only thing left is to try something, see what happens, and _think_. No improvement in tools can substitute for the _experience_ of having gone beyond your tools, over and over again.\n\nThere's a famous saying that insights come to the prepared mind. It's easy to read and watch Bret Victor and imagine that we are in the insight delivery business. But we're really in the mind preparing business.",

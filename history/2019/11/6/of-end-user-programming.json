Visibility - just like excel shows states and formulas leading to them, so should editors. The data and it’s structure should be the priority, not the code.\n2. Good model - Our editors are either text editors or UI editors, what we need is a visual Lisp - a list is a great general conceptual model, a tree is an even better one and everyone understands it. Excel has tables. Everyone gets tables.\n3. Mappings - oh god IDE’s are mostly terrible in this one. Too much information everywhere and you gotta be an expert in the IDE to understand what any mapping does. Excel is not great at this one but pretty good tho, everyone understands it and you can do more if you know the options beyond basics - but don’t need to know them.\n\n4. Feedback - Result is also a part of the process and should be treated as such. Pretty obvious what we need here from excel.",

        "text": "here are a few other things about excel that i don’t see talked about very often: \n\n1. started with existing conceptual tools (double entry accounting, arithmetic, graphs and charts) and gradually extended them, rather than forcing early adopters to immediately understand a whole new abstraction before they could get anything done\n2. direct editing: you don’t have to issue commands to get data entry done. you don’t have to click a link to get to a different part of a sheet. you just click on cells to edit them. if you want abstractions you learn more complex menus and commands but (given enough time and patience) you could manually do pretty much all of excel with the basics. this also makes learning easier\n3. saved state: people copy scratch info to random areas of their tables ALL THE TIME and it’s an incredibly rare feature. wish i had it for the browser\n4. your data is never “finished”. every spreadsheet is a breathing document. they get updated all the time and work in almost every intermediate state. it’s data transformation with structurally typed holes\n5. ubiquitous metaphor. everything is a table\n6. types are visual. you know that blank fields will give you different results. you can see which columns have them\n\n\njust off the top of my head",

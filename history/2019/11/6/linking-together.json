It is this kind of \"outsider\" work that make me enjoy a lot programming, it shows that you can do anything.",

There's nothing they're doing in that piece that couldn't be done in a cross browser way. (NB: they could have generated the image pixel by pixel using square divs and manually set colours. Not saying they _should_, just saying they aren't being forced to support Chrome only.) When I'm making similar CSS craziness (which I do from time to time), I check my work in 3 browsers as I go. There's no extra cost. I'm being appropriately respectful of my audience. And I'm fighting the Chrome monoculture. _This_ is the hacker attitude.",

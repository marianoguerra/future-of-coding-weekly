        "text": "I would assert that REST interfaces are difficult to debug, as you need to see the state on the server and the client at the same time in order to understand the conversation. And most systems don't let you see both at once. A lot of programmers in this area resort to Wireshark dumps to see the packets go by. If your IDE permits examination of both sides at once on the same machine, that will certainly make this process a lot easier. I am not a big fan of text protocols, i want to see the ability to  use binary data, and i hope that your system will help graphically present complex messages with structured data (not JSON, which is as Joe Armstrong calls an inefficient way to ship binary data). I don't consider anything related to REST remotely suitable for the masses however. REST is often used with stateless protocols, yet in game programming, which is arguably half of all programming, the whole point is to track a mutable state on a server, and transmit some subset of that state to the client, and have the client change the part of the universe they control on the server. Games are loaded with finite state machines, and stateless comm protocols are not a great fit. I am working conceptually with a graph database at the client side, and i have difficulty imagining how to use REST API's in that situation.",

        "text": "A very interesting project Dark is. To my knowledge it is the only one focused on the server side, and tackling REST API improvement. It does seem like most clients are emitting RESTful calls, it is the dominant client\/server paradigm today. In fact, i don't see a lot of overlap in the staff between front and back end developers, I think partially that is because the language and toolchain sets between front and back end are currently so different. Parasail is targeting massive multicore problems, Red is targeting Crypto smart contracts, not sure if Luna has anything remotely as concrete as a target yet.",

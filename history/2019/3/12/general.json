        "text": "One of the problems with Van De Vanters work, which was excellent, is that it was based on C, and C is such a low-level language, really a replacement for Assembler, that it would be hard to build something great on top of that language. Its too bad that he didn't pick a more robust language like Modula-2 to base his work, because a strongly typed language like Modula-2 would have allowed for a lot more help from the IDE editor, because the strong naming and type conventions catch a lot of errors and thus the IDE doesn't have to be so smart. This is also the reason JS cannot have a great IDE, because the language itself is so flabby (hence all the preprocessors like TypeScript and CoffeeScript).",

        "text": "Any statistics you see about the decline of funding are put out by the people seeking funding, and as Mark Twain pointed out there are Lies, Damned Lies, and Statistics. The Universities have increased tuition 20x the rate of salary growth (an unsustainable path), the total amount of student debt is so alarming it isn't funny. Administrators of various colleges like Michigan State fly on private jets to pick up their donations, and almost every major magnet city is based around universities across the globe. Mr. Piepgrass' point about his professor making a great salary while publishing incomprehensible papers is all too common today. We don't need free college, we need cheaper college, and there is a lot of fat to trim in the universities.  Long term research has traditionally only been funded by fat market leaders like Bell Labs,IBM, Xerox, Microsoft. Schools don't engage in long term research; they are limited to the time spans of the master and PhD student project lengths, so they do basically 2-4 year projects. Finally after a decade of pouring money into MS research, they came up with the hololens, which is a winning product, and we all know that it will be used extensively in 20 years. Just for medicine alone it is a gigantic breakthrough that is going to change things at a fundamental level. One other thing i should mention is that the federal research dollars are not spread around evenly, the top 20 universities basically take it all. I don't know what goes on inside Google or Apple. They clearly have a lot going on, and Google commendably at least tries to launch various of their more esoteric projects, unlike Apple, which is dominated by fear of embarrassment and failure and basically suppresses release of most of their wacky ideas. Apple makes great products, but let's face it they are a very unusual company.",

It is based on the experience of leading developers of the Unix operating system. Early Unix developers were important in bringing the concepts of modularity and reusability into software engineering practice, spawning a \"software tools\" movement. Over time, the leading developers of Unix (and programs that ran on it) established a set of cultural norms for developing software, norms which became as important and influential as the technology of Unix itself; this has been termed the \"Unix philosophy.\"\nThe Unix philosophy emphasizes building simple, short, clear, modular, and extensible code that can be easily maintained and repurposed by developers other than its creators. The Unix philosophy favors composability as opposed to monolithic design.",

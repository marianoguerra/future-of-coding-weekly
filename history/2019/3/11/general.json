A lot of end user UI is task specific so that is the better choice.\n\nFor creative tasks however, the use case is more like putting a lump of clay on a potter's wheel and then massaging it into your end result with the ability to explore lots of different paths. If a high level editor adds constraints and abstractions that means you can't do this, it becomes a bad editor.\n\nI am quite interested in the philosophy of craftsmanship which has a lot to do with interaction between a craftsman and material. I think a structured editor can achieve the same certainty as text if it's fundamental unit of material has the right properties.\n\nI'm not sure what these properties are but it's something like:\n- predicatable rules of combination\n- always possible to add or remove anything\n- no hidden state\n- can act on groups as you can on individuals\n\nSpreadsheets work quite well with cells as materials. It's not perfect but you know where they are and how to combine them so it feels solid. Spreadsheet formulas however, eh, not so much!",

Nothing obliges Apple, under the current conventions of capitalism, to do anything other than maximise its shareholder value so there's absolutely nothing anomalous in its behaviour. As you say, we should be grateful that many private companies have accidentally ended up disseminating breakthroughs of benefit to society.",

The value of the structured editor is that, because you are rethinking the code display, you are freed up to offer rich program insights and manipulations close to and interspersed with the code. It’s those tools, not the structural tree manipulations, where the real value is.",

        "text": "An issue with “classical” structure editors is the cursor UI, where the thing that is selected at any time is a subexpression (i.e., some subtree within your AST), and any edit you make targets that selected subexpression. This causes awkwardness in situations where we’d rather have text-like entry that relies on operator precedence to construct the tree appropriately. Say we want to type `2 * 3 + 4`. We get to `2 * [3]`, where `3` is selected because we just constructed it. Then we hit plus. A simple structure editor implementation would lead to `2 * (3 + [_])`, which is not what we want. In this implementation, we’d have to first navigate up to select the multiplication expression (`[2 * 3]`) and then hit plus. This kind of mode switching is annoying.  <http:\/\/www.cs.ox.ac.uk\/bernard.sufrin\/edit.pdf> gives a solution to this that leverages online precedence parsing on insertion commands. Hazel does a form of this, I believe Lamdu and mbeddr do as well. Independently of whether we’re switching modes, AST navigation via ‘parent node’ and ‘child node’ commands can also be at odds with an interface that presents things as a linear sequence of characters.",

        "text": "I think another fundamental issue with structure editors today is the implicit assumption that constructing an expression node needs to happen “all at once”. Suppose we have an AST structure that represents a parenthesized expression as a parentheses node with a single subexpression child node, and say we want to place `1 + 2 + 3` in parentheses. Because we’re creating a single node, it seems to make sense that this should be a single ‘parenthesize’ command. This requires the user first to select the entire expression `1 + 2 + 3`, then do ‘parenthesize’. So this requires the expression selection cursor UI, which has issues as described above. One thing that’s nice about a text interface is you can break up expression node construction into multiple insertions. Given `|1 + 2 + 3`, I can type `(`, then move over to the end of the desired subexpression, then type `)`. One approach I’m exploring and implementing in Hazel is having an expression construction mode, where you can similarly rely on multiple keystrokes to specify how to construct an expression node. Given `|1 + 2 + 3`, I type `(`. This gives me `(1[)] + 2 + 3` in expression construction mode, where the right parentheses is selected for moving to the appropriate spot. I hit right, that gives me `(1 + 2[)] + 3`. Hit right again, I get `(1 + 2 + 3[)]`. I then hit enter or `)` and that returns me to the regular edit mode. People like to hate on modes, but it’s not that different from selecting autocomplete suggestions, which people like. The important thing is for that mode to be made visually clear and to be automatically entered\/exited at expected times. This is what distinguishes this expression construction \/ autocomplete modality from the classical structure editing modality described above.",

        "text": "I discovered Michael L. Van De Vanter and his work today. He's been working on advanced code editors already when I was born and recognized several problems with structure editors a long time ago. I read the following papers [1, 2] and can only recommend them. Especially the idea of using only lexical information for structured editing [2] sounds very interesting. His website [3] lists more publications that might be interesting for this community as well.\n[1]: <http:\/\/vandevanter.net\/mlvdv\/publications\/the_documentary_structure_o.html>\n[2]: <http:\/\/vandevanter.net\/mlvdv\/publications\/displaying_and_editing_sour.html>\n[3]: <http:\/\/vandevanter.net\/mlvdv\/publications\/>\n\nPS: This demo video shows cool things like proportional fonts, managed whitespace and IDE features that still aren't widely used nowadays. And it's from 1994 :astonished:: <http:\/\/vandevanter.net\/mlvdv\/publications\/the-clarity-code-processor.html>",

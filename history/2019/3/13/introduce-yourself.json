        "text": "Hi people from the future,\n\nI'm based in Portugal and I've started working at OutSystems 18 years ago, where we are approaching this opportunity space more from a business side, targeting medium-large companies. Historically it's been hard, as there has been a lot of push-back from the more technical crowd.\n\nRecently industry analysts (Gartner, Forrester) have discovered there is a big market for these low-code solutions (thanks, in part, to our own effort), and we're riding that wave and have become an Unicorn.\n\nWe've always approached development from a user experience angle, and now we have more and more established usability practices that steer our IDE and our language.\n\nLooking forward to learn and share, and for the critique of a group that has this subject in their hearts and minds.\n\nWe have a free version that can be tried out at <https:\/\/www.outsystems.com\/>",

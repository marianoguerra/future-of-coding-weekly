The male designer made choices not very suitable for target audience by having an interesting background that to a woman feels like stained fabric. In position of being pregnant ( so far this position is “women only” )) and the choice like that is a no-no for design in particular app. In some situations design have to be done by a woman. And in some situations it should be better done by a man. I feel that if we actually value the differences we will be closer to having a respect.  That is just my opinion. I do not want to be like a man or treated like one. Perhaps my position is not very modern. I do not know. ",

Which is the remaining 90% of the population, if our techie sample was 10%.\n\nThe target audience of my own work is the 90%. I'm very lucky to have three excellent examples of that in my close family!\n\nI normally don't discuss Onex with techies because they simply _can't understand it_!! My family gets it right away.",

        "text": "Negroponte has many flaws, and since i had a buddy who worked for him at the Architecture machine back in 76, it would be humorous to recount those. But he does make some good points like Apple is so secretive that nothing, not even new products they desperately need, seem to be able to escape the final committee that is so afraid of failure or being considered lacking in creativity they withhold all new products (and even stall updating existing ones, like the Mac Pro which is now 6 years without an update! imagine if Samsung sat on their Galaxy flagship for 6 years what would have happened?). But his assertion that government research is dwindling is not factual. Governments across the world are funding universities to the highest level in history, but because of the peer review system which has been corrupted, only projects that are sympathetic to the existing staffers on the committees that award funding get funded, and so breakthrough ideas are left unfunded. I have an old saying, \"you get what you finance\". If you stimulate mini-malls with tax credits, you will fill your country with those. In the case of physics research, we have seen over 20 years of suppression of LENR (aka cold fusion) research, instead continuing to dump billions into completely unworkable hot fusion projects which has been 30 years away from working, for the last 50 years... Thankfully in computers we haven't been dependent that much on govt and academic funding.  In the computer area, Academia has produced so little of value for the last 10 years, i can't think of a single language like Pascal or Modula-2 that Prof. Wirth's small group produced, that i have been able to profitably use. If you tabulate the major breakthroughs of computer software, they are invariably the result of private companies' research, whether it be Xerox, or Visicalc, Lotus 123, etc.",

        "text": "David Piepgrass: it's not too late at night. That's a fundamental problem we have, in trying to describe what we have*. Essentially the goal was creating a new interactive content creation and sharing platform, and the main technique to reach that was directing development of distributed (CRUD) event sourcing towards that goal and taking its development to logical conclusion on several different sub-domains. End result is... kind of hard to describe* without 1. face-to-face interaction 2. if one can't assume the listener knows event sourcing and 3. without demonstrating how it works*.\nAs such, the buzzwords in the README.md are indeed just condensed descriptions of implemented features, not design goals. The document was written with the specific intent of \"dump all truths we have in there with minimal effort, and expand when required and when the particular system has stabilized\".\n\nAll the items marked with * are items where writing good documentation takes non-trivial time investment, so I need to make a prioritization decision on whether to invest time doing those things.\nHence my original question about the dynamics of people in this forum.\n\nThe arrogance of these thoughts is out of necessity. We believe in our solution and have staked our medium-term livelihoods on it without comfortable funding, which is kind of insane... we've tried looking for funding of all kinds: but investors understandably want relatively straightforwardly understandable concepts. No one wants to feel stupid when investing their own or someone else's money.\nOur concept is not such a simple concept unless one groks event sourcing. So no big funding, no surprise there. But that means we gotta prioritize stuff that actually pays or directly improves our solution on the technical side.\n\nAnyway, I digress.\n\nThere's a strong probability that I will invest the time in updating the documentation that is written with this community in mind in the coming months when a good opportunity arises. From my technical perspective this is the most promising community audience indeed.",

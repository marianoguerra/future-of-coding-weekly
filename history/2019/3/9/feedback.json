        "text": "&gt; many modern DJ's are doing generative music with various tools\n\nI don't think I agree - DJs are using tools that don't give them that freedom, I believe there's a huge difference between generative\/system music (even early Steve Reich work) and what DJs are doing.\n\n&gt; And isn't every 3D graphics program effectively a very complex programming language that is a mixture of data, built-in algorithms, and lots of direct manipulation\n\nInteresting take on this, my intuition tells me that there's a difference though between using blender, and writing python for blender. Although I'd have to think about it to tell you why, maybe I'm mistaken and there's really no difference after all.",

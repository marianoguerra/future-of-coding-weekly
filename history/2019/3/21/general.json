        "text": "You are correct that if you don't care how complex it is, or how ugly, you could create a new language pretty quickly. GitHub probably has 100 languages invented in the last year. But as for a simple general purpose language taking a lot of man-hours, the evidence from the Red, Eve, Luna, and Beads projects shows that thousands of man-hours are indeed input into such a project. To be general purpose, you have to test it against a diverse set of project types, from games, to business applications to scientific, all the while making adjustments to keep smoothing the rough spots, while trying to keep it simple. If you exclude data storage and graphical interface\/event management, and imagine we are still in the 70's on terminals, you can probably crank out a simple language like Lua or Python easily enough, but i don't expect any new general purpose language to catch on if it can't do interaction and at least touch on client-server types of programs. We already have acceptable terminal-based languages that can't draw or interact, i don't think we need any more. Swift, which is probably the best designed language from the major players, is representative of the end of the road of OOP. Certainly the Apple development community has strongly embraced it, and i think it has a very good percentage of use in the Apple ecosystem, ramping up faster than hardly any other language.  Another aspect of language design that sucks up the man-hours is the diverse range of platforms that are now extant: you have wristwatch computers, mobile phones, tablets, desktops, browser apps, game consoles, VR headsets, AR headsets, so many more platforms than before, and so many more devices to connect with. This is one of the big reasons for example Swift got taken up so fast: if you want an Apple Watch App, you are very likely going to be using XCode and one of only 2 languages. It is very hard for new languages to cover the full breadth of computing today. If you get down into the nitty-gritty of the GPU, you are talking tens of thousands of hours to master each of the commonly used GPU's. This is why people use Adobe AIR, and Unity, and Unreal Engine, because those systems did the really low level work of learning the hardware and making a reasonable layer on top of the hardware to make it feasible. You will note therefore that most of the projects listed on Steve Krouse's spreadsheet are 2D products, because a 3D platform is a truly massive undertaking, and a moving target because 3D hardware is iterating fast.",

        "text": "Fair enough; I was not aware of that aspect of history in detail, thanks for the correction.\nHowever it still does not essentially change my point; creating new languages by copying major parts of existing ones and making adaptations is perfectly valid strategy. I would argue that it's the most sane strategy, in fact.\nI can't really comment too much about Datalog because I know jack shit about that, but a brief google states that it's at the very least a syntactic derivative of Prolog.\nWhile I can be persuaded that the JS-in-10-days is essentially a myth, the whole \"standing on top of 'giants'\" still clearly applies. Everything's a derivative.\nAnd the context of this topic as far as I see is not \"how much is the total work that has gone into making a language X possible\", but \"what is the incremental work needed to make language X possible, given already existing tools and languages.\"",

For example if the language innovation that one is pursuing is on the front-end side, then the only thing you need is to specify the runtime semantics be such that they can be reasonably efficiently expressed in C, JS or Java runtime models and you're... well not golden, but let's say \"silver\".",

        "text": "I have published on my blog the specifications and ingredients for various small reference programs, starting with a clock (150 words) , then a wristwatch simulation, then snake, tic-tac-toe, minesweeper and ending with chess (no AI, just two player). That project set spans from 150 to 1500 words of code, and have given these challenges to some of the various next gen language teams like Red, Luna, etc. You can also compare them to the various GitHub examples that have been done in longstanding languages like JS, Java, etc.  One thing you immediately have to deal with is the graphical subsystem that the language uses; that is a major factor, and in a lot of older environments they predate the explosion of target devices, and one cannot actually make a resolution-reactive product in these older frameworks without great difficult. Another issue you see immediately when looking at existing toolchains like Objective-C\/Swift from Apple is the gigantic number of system API calls you have to learn to do almost anything. You have a dozen major library subsystems to learn, must to make a sound effect, respond to a click, and draw an image. So one of the biggest problems i see is the total number of pages you have to read in order to accomplish these simple functions. Thats what makes a little game maker tool like fancade so outstanding; it manages to boil down the verbs and nouns to a small enough set you can program on a cellphone.",

        "text": "I'm well aware that a _simulation_ of an entire bacterium is generally beyond our computational abilities. To counterargue,\n1. both bacteria and mitochondria vary a lot in size, and some are less than one micron in all dimensions.\n2. a car is ~2 metres wides. The planet is ~20,000,000 metres from pole to pole. Across two dimensions that's (over) 14 orders of magnitude (510 trillion m^2). But individual cars are generally discernable in Google Maps.\n3. I don't see what the problem is with the visualization. The person building the model knows the boundaries of each component and subcomponent (AFAIK the model cannot be produced automatically using, say, an electron microscope; experts in the detailed structure would have to make it, so they know the boundaries) so these boundaries can be easily highlighted for visualization. And with a GPU, local approximate simulations of parts of the cell should be possible.\n4. I think lots of _software developers_ feel a low need for visualizations compared to the general population, but I don't feel that way. It's weird to me to hear someone imply that we need not \"visualize\" a physical object.",

        "text": "I wasn't claiming that we shouldn't visualize physical objects. I was claiming that focusing on _just_ the physical is an intellectual disease. When we think of the world we mostly visualize maps. When we think of \"Steve Jobs\" we mostly visualize his body, which is why sharing the same restaurant or auditorium with it seems to become worthy of comment. But the geography of the world hides many flows that would be better off emphasized. Steve Jobs when he lived inhabited a far vaster phase space than just his body.\n\nI think you should visualize a bacterium or mitochondrion out of building blocks of flows rather than atoms. That may end up being vastly more complex or less complex, depending on the details of the flows you choose. Neither should stop you.\n\nShort story recommendation: <https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/17084967-wang-s-carpets>",

Is it supposed to make it easier for beginners? More efficient for experts?\nSince there are a lot of other structured editors, I'd also be interested in what you do differently and how you're going to tackle the usability issues structured editors have a reputation for.\nWithout having tried it, selection based on tree traversal seems unintuitive to me. Do you have plans to change that in the future?\nAnd a minor suggestion: You could display keyboard shortcuts in the mouse menu. That way, it'd be easier for people to transition from using the mouse to using the keyboard shortcuts.\nThanks for sharing the demo :+1:",

Evidently I wasn't aligned with my bosses, nor did I have a lot of contact with them as they are usually 7 time zones away.\n\nI was puzzled why the problems with the software had gone unaddressed for so long; I guess management  doesn't appreciate people trying to take the focus away from \"next quarter\" problems.",

I wanted to work on improving the inefficient build &amp; release processes, but I was told, \"no, we hired a C++ developer and we want to see your C++ skills.\" So after 3 intensive months of studying how our spaghetti-code software worked, I was ready to do a major rewrite of one component and I was determined to show that I had excellent C++ skills... just as I was working late nights to put the finishing touches on it, that's when I was fired. I'd say there was over 3 months of training (mapping out roughly half of this excruciatingly bad software) and just 4 weeks of actual software development, 4 months total. There was no warning - no one told me I was doing it wrong.",

        "text": "That sounds very frustrating. One thing I've learned is that it's not enough to be right about something, but it's equally important to be able to communicate to those who are making the decision why it might be the best way to go forward, and also be open to the idea that there could be factors (not necessarily technical) at play that I'm not considering. I obviously know nothing about your particular situation, but I think often we in the software field expect the \"right answer\" to be as obvious to others as it sometimes feels to us. It's very difficult, and a very different skill to package up a \"right answer\" in a way that makes it clear to others. I think that's a big part of what folks working on novel programming ideas struggle with too. A particularly skilled or patient higher-up might be easier to communicate with, but we don't always have such luxury.",

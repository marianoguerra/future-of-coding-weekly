I’ve been lurking on this Slack for a while after enjoying a few episodes of Steve’s podcast. Some relevant bits of history:\n1. Ever since I first logged onto *LambdaMOO* in 1993, I’ve been obsessed with the potential for *shared programmable worlds*. This led me to 5 years working at *Linden Lab*, the creators\/maintainers of *Second Life*, Blocksworld and Sansar, all of which are shared programmable worlds like MOO. It taught me a huge amount about the underestimated benefits and problems of these systems.\n2. I spent 4 years at *18F*, a consultancy within the US Government. It teaches departments about agile development &amp; procurement, user-centered design and open source, all with the aim of serving citizens better. Most of my time was spent both programming new systems and learning about legacy ones. *It convinced me that most of our software development was inherently a bad idea*, and that it would be better to build on no-code\/low-code systems, and to focus on empowering staffers rather than automating their jobs away.\n3. I’m fascinated by debugging, with existing and new tools. I’ve given talks on debugging (see thread) and played around with creating new debugging tools.\n4. These days I’m something of a software pessimist, to the point where I’m not sure that we should be teaching kids to code at all - at least, not until we are able to sufficiently manage the complexity we create.\n5. I love amazing bug stories - see the thread for a couple, and also for my favourite computing paper.\n\nLooking forward to meeting and chatting with folks!",

        "text": "Hi Everyone,\n\nIt was great to meet some of you today at the SF\/Dynamicland meetup. While I've\nbeen on Slack for a bit, I never posted to introductions so here it is.\n\nI'm a software engineer professionally and over time I've grown increasingly\ndissatisfied with the general state of affairs. It was all fun and games for a\nwhile, but then I started watching Alan Kay videos :smile:. While digging into\nhistorical ideas and banging my head against what seem to be a hard ceiling in\nmany of the tools and systems we use, I've arrived at the position that there is\na large space of possibilities that has been left unexplored while we continue\nto incrementally hammer away at the entrenched systems. I believe big leaps can\nonly happen if many established fundamental ideas are changed or replaced. For\ninstance, we store and share *information* by encoding it in a\nnon-introspectable, very low level medium (aka files) that also loses its\nconnections to related information, history and identity. We then redesign these\nfeatures over and over in various ways in different contexts. Programs as text\nfiles is another poor representation. We re-implement the same functionality and\nschemas in different siloed processes and services. It seems our language for\ninterconnection and scaling up is really poor. Much of programming deals with\nstuff that isn't really computing anything but just dealing with represenation\nchanges (e.g. parsing - doesn't change the information content). Worse, this\ntype of represenation shuffling code is tightly intermingled with the computing\ncode. We sit in front of powerful computers, and simulate them in our heads -\nhumans are simulating the general purpose simulator.\n\nSo what's an alternative? I don't know but perhaps creating a new\nPL\/DB\/framework to fit in a PL\/DB\/framework shaped hole in the current mess may not\nhelp. We need to explore ideas that are holisitic, ground up rethinking of what\ncomputing is, how the space is partitioned into concepts and artifacts (note\nfiles\/filesystems, OS processes, databases, 'programs', compilers etc. are all\nmeans to an end, serving the users achieve some of their goals - what are the\ngoals and what other ways can they be expressed?). How does something like this\n'alternative substrate' or 'new material for computing' fit onto the existing\nworld? It doesn't, but my interest is more of a research exercise - how can it\nbe done, what would make it complete and self sustaining? If we have some good\nideas, we can prototype. Since this is broad and can go in all directions, I've\nbeen writing to try and clear my thoughts and keep moving forward in some way.\nIf you're interested take a look at <https:\/\/shalabh.com\/programmable-systems\/>",

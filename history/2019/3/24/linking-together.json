        "text": "Shouldn't be surprising. A carbon atom is ~1 ångström in diameter. A mitochondrion (smaller of your examples) is 3 microns in diameter. That's 4 orders of magnitude in one dimension. Across three dimensions that's 12 orders of magnitude.\n\nAlso, the atoms don't exactly \"fit\" together. Cells are fundamentally liquid, and the system has more in common with fluid dynamics than Legos. It's also a dynamic system so you need to answer the question of how long the model should simulate. Which adds another dimension and orders of magnitude of complexity.\n\nThere's also the question of initial conditions. Since it's a dynamic system, a random initial configuration doesn't actually cover everything. Even the far simpler simulation of a 3-body solar system is complex enough that we're still finding new arrangements of stable orbits.\n\nAnd even after doing _all_ this, a model wouldn't actually be good for very much. It would seem mostly like noise to us. Finding the right abstractions for the visualization would be far more difficult a problem. The visualization itself wouldn't be much help in finding the right abstractions, going by history.\n\nLately I think of over-valuing visualizations as a cognitive bias. The visual cortex is evolved for a tiny, tightly circumscribed set of circumstances. We don't yet appreciate quite how far beyond its abilities we've gone.",

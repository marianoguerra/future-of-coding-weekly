But I’m super interested in other (simple) ways to measure code complexity, so counting words sounds intriguing.\n\nAnd is the source for your progression of apps available online (GitHub maybe) to take a look?",

I haven't posted all of the apps yet, but i did post the first two (clock and wristwatch). Yes of course you have to strip comments out before counting the words.  You can't use lines because then you get a huge advantage for horizontal languages like Red which would unfairly lead you to the conclusion that Red programs are 1\/5th that of other languages, which in reality they are merely very horizontal with lots of run on\/ chaining operators which is reminiscent of APL.",

I can see why counting words is more useful when you deal with smaller snippets of code. I don’t know Red, and I suppose that both language features and coding style are a consideration for the word-based approach too, as for instance `for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 100; i++) {` and `for(int i=0;i&lt;=100;i++){ ` are 10 vs. 2 words, if just using spaces as delimiter (what `wc` does by default). \n\nBoth are a good examples for applying a lower-level concept that considers the data to just be text for a domain where the data actually has higher-level structure. What we get is a much simpler (and more commonly available) tool, which also turns out to be rather imprecise for the domain were applying it to. Still good enough for many use cases, especially if language and style can be assumed stable across comparisons.",

Application programming is the word for this. It seems to have fallen out of use, though, right? There used to be this clear separation between application and system programming... that there should be two domains of intensity of programming.\"_\n\nArguably what happened is that application programming became hard as single applications started having lots and lots of users. It's not that we need to add more terms for different kinds of programming, rather to notice that using the same app as lots of other people gradually causes you to descend into living in a _favela_.\n\n• There have been many prototypes exploring many different ideas, but one constant through them all is a deep faith in structured editing.\n\n• _\"What [abstractions] would be the easiest to visualize? Let's say you're programming with continuations and all these category theoretic abstractions that people love these days, okay? Trying to materialize those into UI is a Herculean effort.\"_\n\n• _\"We've got to figure out a way of funding the engineering needed to redo stuff. We just can't keep adding layers.\"_ <@U6KQ2S410> do you have thoughts on how your current work connects up with this? Is redoing stuff going to address the expert use cases as well? I'm interpreting it as rethinking lower levels of the stack so that say `ls` has fewer commandline flags or something. But that seems to require thinking through how current experts operate?\n\n• What to expect from his next project, Subtext Alpha: _\"It's a full programming system, a full graphical environment that you program in. The text shows up on the screen, but there's no text files. There is a textual syntax. It turns out that really, really is a handy way of defining and building a language, but the textual syntax is only designed to support simple examples and test cases. It's not designed to support building and editing and incrementally modifying code. It doesn't support everything you can do in the language.\"_\n\n• _\"I think that I'm one of the oldest young programmers.\"_ [Ran into computers in 1970 at the age of 13.]\n• DEC is the company that outcompeted Data General, the company depicted in _Soul of a New Machine_.

So some new ideas for questions to ask ourselves that may act as a \"sorting hat\" to get us collaborating with like-minded people:\n\n• _Optimizing for learnability vs power once learned._ There's lots of overlap between these categories, things that would work for either side, and that's ok. But what's your fundamental goal\/intention?\n\n• _Simple vs complex use-cases._ (Jonathan Edwards refers to this in a couple of ways in the above interview. On the one hand, focusing on how people learn programming or new tools vs how experts use tools. There he prefers simple use cases. The experience of learning is anything but simple, but the programs beginners try to write are typically simpler than what experts try to do. On the other hand, Jonathan also draws a distinction between people supporting just \"canned parameterizable components\" and \"full on programming\". So his approach seems to be to go as simple as possible but not so simple that you lose the essence of programming. There may be other ways to slice this dimension.)\n\n• _Adding new layers to the stack vs redoing existing layers._ I suspect any new prototype has to start out building at the top, but is the intention to eventually burrow down? (It seems to be Jonathan's intention, though it wasn't really clear what the plan is to get there. Perhaps the attempts at creating new institutions fit here, hoping to inspire others to run with prototypes, retrofitting them back into existing stacks? I'm skeptical that existing power users can be relied upon to make truly deconstructive moves on a tool or layer that they're fluent with. The incentives don't work.)\n\nAnyway, that's a few more bends in the idea maze. I'd love for others to add to this list, going beyond this particular interview. (My previous comment linked above had 4 questions as well, with one point repeated here.)\n\n\/cc <@U6KQ2S410> <@UD3AK9JRF>",

        "text": "One alternative to an idea maze for sorting ourselves may be for each of us to list principles, so that we can build up some sort of adjacency matrix to figure out who overlaps most with us. Here's a list for myself I came up with after chatting with <@UD3AK9JRF> last week, trying to be opinionated rather than bland:\n\n• Longevity over adoption.\n• Implementation matters.\n   - Transparency over abstraction.\n   - Minimize dependencies. No, _really_.\n   - Minimize number of languages used.\n   - Conciseness of language is secondary.\n• Rewarding curiosity about implementation should be a first-class design goal.\n   - Doesn’t matter what the architecture is; _can others tell_ what the architecture is?\n   - Encode knowledge first about the outside. Environment\/context over algorithms. (tests)\n   - Encode knowledge in the repo. No other place to look at. “Don’t make me talk to you.”\n   - Knowledge automatically complains when it goes out of date. (tests)\n   - Keep it easy to update. (domain-independent traces over domain-specific immediate UIs)\n   - Organize knowledge autobiographically, in a cleaned up version history. (layers)\n• Make it tractable to delete features.\n   - Encourage more forks.\n• Don’t charge for software. Messes with long-term incentives. (Charging for hosting\/operational services is ok.)\n\nComments most appreciated. I also worry that I'm too verbose in my comments, so feel free to tell me that :slightly_smiling_face:",

Anyway, we might be about to dig down and down to get at what we really care most about, and then compare \"branches\" off common roots. That might allow for more meaningful cross-influence (and purpose) than comparing features for features sake (I say \"features\", but whatever else it may be).\n\nAnyway, potentially big task, and it might not be perfect; but in all seriousness, maybe we should try to make a \"tree\" or commonality?

I'm a UX designer and user researcher by day, but I've got Bret Victor's 2014 CDG research agenda tacked up on my wall, and I think there are a lot more intersections between this sort of work and more qualitative knowledge work (like user research) than is being broadly pursued.  I wrote up some early armchair Dynamicland commentary here: <http:\/\/vitor.io\/on-dynamicland> and followed it up on Jason Brennan's forum here: <http:\/\/discuss.nearthespeedoflight.com\/t\/dynamicland\/86\/9> (thoughts gratefully welcomed!)",

This will be my first time writing these ideas out loud, and I hope you’ll ask questions if they don’t make sense, and that you’ll have thoughts in response if they do.

It feels like the Geokit essay covers how Dynamicland currently functions in practice pretty well, in that it’s 1:1 with my imagination coming out of my essay last year.

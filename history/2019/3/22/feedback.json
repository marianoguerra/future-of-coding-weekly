When using a keyboard shortcut for toggling comments, entering comments becomes consistent among many languages (just tried it with Rust, Python and TS in vscode, works out of the box). Additionally, syntax highlighting makes it easy to recognize comments and differentiate them from other code. I'd argue that when using an editor that provides both, the actual PL's choice of comment syntax doesn't matter. You could probably show Python code using C-style comments to me and as long as the comment would still be highlighted as comments, I wouldn't even recognize the difference.",

Here are three examples:\n\n1. LeMP: the lexical macro processor is language-agnostic and since it works at the level of syntax, not semantics, it can be used to transform code of any language.\n2. Tree-structured find \/ find and replace: I wrote basic pattern-matching and find-and-replace algorithms for Loyc trees, so again, given the necessary parsers, the same algorithms can be used with any language.\n3. Gathering comments. Typical lexers throw comments away since the parser can't easily handle comments in arbitrary locations. But if you gather the comments and newlines into a list, I've written a language-independent algorithm to recombine the comments with the Loyc tree produced by the parser. (It requires a small amount of custom code per-language, and in order for the algorithm to work reliably, there are some reasonable constraints on the relationship between the Loyc tree and the original text. But it's a lot less hassle than reimplementing the algorithm from scratch for every language.)",

                "text": "Conway's law is an adage named after computer programmer Melvin Conway, who introduced the idea in 1967. It states that\n\norganizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.\n\nThe law is based on the reasoning that in order for a software module to function, multiple authors must communicate frequently with each other. Therefore, the software interface structure of a system will reflect the social boundaries of the organization(s) that produced it, across which communication is more difficult. Conway's law was intended as a valid sociological observation, although sometimes it's used in a humorous context. It was dubbed Conway's law by participants at the 1968 National Symposium on Modular Programming.",

Maybe I learn more today? :D)\nSo for this situation all three groups are considerably larger and language designers...

I'm worried that WebAssembly will become wildly popular and then features that could have been possible in new programming languages will be dropped because \"Wasm can't do that\" or \"We can do that but there would be a performance hit on Wasm so... let's not bother\".",

I think my reasoning is that anybody who wants the power-user ability to comment out a whole block is also going to be using a high-power editor that can provide a single shortcut for it. `shift-3 down left` seems pretty lame as well :stuck_out_tongue: (Among other issues, it requires you to think about empty lines.)\n\nThis is turning into a bit of a tangent, but I think language syntax for block comments is deservedly an obsolete idea:\n\na) Non-nesting block comments (the way C and Java implement them) is obviously bad. I can't block-select twice to comment out.\n\nb) Even if you have nestable block comments, you now have to be careful to only select well-contained blocks.\n\nAll this is unnecessarily complex. Just select blocks and hit `C-\/`, and it'll always do what you want. Use my recommendation above and have the shortcut insert an extra leader character, and you'll also be able to undo such block comments really easily, while leaving real comments untouched. It works really well, and as I said in my reddit comment above, I don't really understand why editors and IDEs don't support it out of the box.",

        "text": "I predict it'll usually be ranges but the lowest-common-denominator is row\/col pairs, as all parsers need to be able to produce those for error messages. As a hack the algorithm ought to still generally work if you combine row\/cols into an integer (like, top 16 bits for row, 15 bits for col). A bit less hacky, one could use `IndexPositionMapper` to go from row\/cols back to indexes. The main thing some parsers might be missing is an end index (in compilers that can only report start indexes in errors, not ranges) in which case, yeah, you'd have to retrofit the parser. And some parsers (including my own) might occasionally have a bug in their range assignments, which tends to cause comments to be assigned to the wrong place in the AST.",

I had a bunch of C libraries I wanted to be able to use at my job but without them taking ownership. I didn't need\/want them to pay me for the libraries I just wanted to make my life easier.\n\nI have a friend who has a very popular open source library . popular enough it's nearly a full time job maintaining it. fortunately he got hired by Google to maintain it but he's been \"stuck\" with it for like 8 years now. He might enjoy that but I can't imagine myself enjoying feeling stuck on one project so long.\n\n",

There is, however, a shrinking ratio between science funding (and quantity of professorships) to the number of people who would like to be either college-level teachers or professional researchers [pet peeve: that universities conflate these roles].",

I assume there are lots of other areas where getting funding is too difficult, e.g. consider the case of Ketamine where no one is paying for the necessary work to get FDA approval - <https:\/\/slatestarcodex.com\/2019\/03\/11\/ketamine-now-by-prescription\/>\n\nIt seems fair to hypothesize that the amount of innovation _per capita_ has gone down. This, along with funding difficulties in certain areas, could seem to innovators-at-heart as stagnation [but I'm not familiar with Thiel's opinions].",

It is inevitable when you allow concentration of this kind to occur that it becomes corrupt and stale. Luckily, technology has advanced so greatly that it doesn't take much R&amp;D budget to produce a breakthrough.",

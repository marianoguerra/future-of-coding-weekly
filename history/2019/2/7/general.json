        "text": "<@UC6997THT> I think the core problem with diffing\/merging (V)PL code is the *mismatch between the data structure of the code and the data structure the diff works on*. The data structure that most naturally represents code is some kind of a tree\/graph. This data structure is usually stored by encoding it in a binary or textual (JSON\/XML) format. The encoded data structure is a flat string \/ array of bytes that still contains all information of the initial data structure, but needs to be decoded\/parsed to use that information. We then usually take these encoded data structures and perform diffs on them. This works well with changes in the initial data structure that only lead to local changes in the encoded data structure (e.g. changing a `1` literal to a `0`), but fails in more complex cases (e.g. changing the order of elements, wrapping an element, ...). It's like comparing two strings by encoding them as a images first and performing a pixel-by-pixel diff on the images afterwards. Even small changes like adding a character would lead to large differences in the encoded images. We should really move past text-based diffs and use AST \/ data structure diffs instead IMO.\n\nIt's also interesting to note that *more accurate diffs also reduce the number of conflicts*. For example, if user A adds a parameter to a function and user B changes the return type, a line-based diff would yield a merge conflict. A diff that works on an AST-like structure could detect these changes accurately and combine them without producing a conflict.\n\n*Splitting code into smaller files seems like a hack to me*. It forces git to only search for changes locally (within the file), which might indeed help getting smaller diffs for local changes. On the other hand, non-local changes like combining two files into one become even harder. If we'd perform diffs on data structures instead, local changes would lead to small diffs quite naturally...",

This comes up every now and then so that it almost feels like we all agree on this, but yet I haven’t seen this anywhere. Why is that?\n\nIs it too hard to implement? Are there implementation challenges that I can’t see (because I haven’t tried)?\n\nOr maybe is there a good solution I just haven’t heard about that just needs to become more popular?\n\nOr is it because it’s too daunting with all the text-based tools (git etc.) in place that nobody really believes we can pull this off?\n\nThis seems like a smaller, much more manageable version of the grand “let’s revolutionize programming” problem, so if that is not happening for whatever reason I wonder if there are any insights to gain for the even bigger challenges we discuss here.",

The issue is that an AST representation tends to be verbose both structurally and with an excess of redundant meta-data that is otherwise perfectly comprehensible in the underlying text.\n\nThe thing people may be missing is that the underlying text is the most elegant and human readable version of the behaviour that the language designer and programmer could achieve. If the AST was clearer, that would be the underlying text.\n\nJust like @ says with diffing vpl text serialisations, ast visualisation is not wysiwyg. It takes a lot of effort to look at an AST and actually match it to the code you wrote.\n\nI think the potential value is as an information layer on top of the text diff. You can use AST information to indicate that a value's type has changed in a passage of code despite the underlying text not changing. This however is very much in the realm of \"neat idea\" i.e. I can't recall a situation where this would have been super valuable.",

At the low level, semantic constraints makes more things unmergeable e.g.  can't merge a boolean and number value. I haven't been able to make semantic knowledge about higher level constructs produce a better result. You might be able ensure syntactic correctness but the real problem at the heart of merging is preserving intent. I have found that broken text can better preserve conflicting intent and provide a better basis for a resolution than coerced correct syntax. I think this is because:\n\n- merging text = merging the actual material that is changed\n- merging asts = merging a higher level interpretation of the material\n\nSurprisingly, I believe the underlying material that people are editing better captures intent and the high level interpretation can disguise it.\n\nI think AST merge lets you identify more types of conflict but rarely new types of resolution. If you want radically better merge you need radically better information about the **intent** of the change in addition to the change itself.\n\nThis is something that could be achieved by a new class of editor that captures more about a user's editing intent in addition to the actual changes to AST or underlying material.",

        "text": "<@U5STGTB3J> Good Questions. I guess that the reasons are somewhat historical \/ cultural (for example in the Unix Philosophy: \"Avoid stringently columnar or binary input formats\"). A lot of people have probably tried working with binary formats and failed because tools for viewing, searching, editing, diffing, ... weren't available. It also seems like most binary formats are very domain specific which indeed requires custom tools for the tasks I listed before. These formats also cannot be used beyond their original use-cases which means that they're not universal.\n\nSo the interesting question to me is whether it'd be possible to create a \"universal\" general-purpose binary format that could be used to encode domain specific data structures. Something that allows to encode trees, graphs, lists, primitive types, ... would be nice. You could then write tools for editing, seaching, diffing, ... these \"universal\" files. Applications could encode their data structure in this format like they currently do with text.\n\nI don't know whether something like this exists, but even if it did, you'd still have to convince people to use it. This is probably the hardest part.",

It might be wrong but closer to the solution.\n\nI'll try and give the simplest example. Assume three way merge within lines:\n\nOriginal: `var x = 3;`\nUser A: `var x = 4;`\nUser B: `var x = \"3\";`\n\nText merge: `var x = \"4\";`\nSemantic merge: conflict - can't merge string literal and number literal\n\nEssentially I needed pairwise merge rules between different types of semantic transformation. Text merge only needs to implement one pairwise merge rule for all text edits.\n\nIn this case, we could combine text and number edits by stringyifying numbers but doing this type of thing is relaxing semantic constraints rather than taking advantage of them so it now seems like a hard way to do a dumb text merge.",

        "text": "&gt; &gt; We should really move past text-based diffs and use AST \/ data structure diffs instead IMO.\n&gt; Yeah, agreed. This comes up every now and then so that it almost feels like we all agree on this, but yet I haven’t seen this anywhere. Why is that?\n\nI think you can't retrofit this idea onto systems built around the plain text medium. For any language, the language designer has put a lot of thought into the text syntax with specific goals such as comprehension. How editors and version systems treat the text files is not something that is designed at all - it's already *established* and an important context that the designer works within. The AST is designed, but not for the same purpose as the surface syntax. When talking about AST\/graph based versioning, we're really talking about a context shift - a deeper shift in the primary surface medium - i.e. some structured editing medium *instead* of plain text blob editing. Really we want a top to bottom redesign here - languages designed for structured editing combined with a common medium and tooling for viewing and manipulation. I don't think anyone has nailed this yet to get the fluidity and flexibility needed for multi purpose expression. As an example of a frame with a different medium - if we were to say we're going to implement a language to express programs as 'spreadsheets', we're immediately thinking about what the rows here or columns there could represent, and not the high level plain text syntax. Diffs and versioning also falls out of the medium - we think of cell oriented diffs.\n\nAnother aspect with structured editing is that versioning could be integrated with the editing experience. The idea is you want to preserve identity of the cells\/nodes\/items while you manipulate them. The possible power for semantic merging does seem higher than text. E.g. you might be able to encode that multiple items added to an entity are all merged and global identifier renames merged properly with other changes. But we'd want any custom merge logic to also be embedded in the medium.",

        "text": "To answer <@U5STGTB3J>’s original question as to why AST Diffs aren’t more widely used I’d offer a few points. \n\nFirst — I’ve tried doing this before and some of the less intuitive technical challenges come as the structure of the ASTs changes over time.  Your diff and merge algorithms then need to have a notion of migrations between each subsequent version of the language— even additions of new types \/ relationships can cause a problem for the algorithms. This unfortunately brings along a terrible scaling characteristic — the algorithms for each language gets much more complex as time goes on — never something you want to build in. Meanwhile Git works the same way on every type of text file and it hasn’t changed much in 10+ years of reliable operation. \n\nSecond — you need to consider what problem this is actually solving and what representation the user is expected to work on? Is it a text reconstruction of the AST you check in or is it the AST itself? If it’s text then you likely have to store that \/ diff it too or formatting is lost on each commit. So all you do is bolt on complexity to Git. Also it’s non-trivial to regenerate code from an AST — especially code you’d want to work with as a developer. \n\nIn general — complex solutions are hard to maintain, collaborate on and advance. With dozens of languages to support and thousands of versions it’s no surprise that text has won. Think in terms of natural selection — same level of fitness for a fraction of the cost is going to win out over time. \n\nI think AST diffs will be important in the future but not for SCM use cases. They’ll be used to help people code alongside generators without worrying about losing their manual contributions. That domain is sufficiently constrained and provides enough value that I think we’ll see production tools using it within 4-10 years. ",

        "text": "I am one of those opposed to prettiers. The topic comes up about once a year on the Chrome team. Someone suggests \"We should add a auto formatter to the commit system\" and then it's always pointed out that an auto formatter never handles the exceptions and ends up making the code less readable.\n\nMaybe you believe there should be no exceptions. I disagree. As a simple example let's take javascript objects. should they be\n\n```\nconst arrayOfRects = [\n  { x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, },\n  { x: 123, y: 45, width: 10, },\n  { x: -45, y: -410, width: -123, },\n];\n```\n\nvs\n\n```\nconst arrayOfRects = [\n  {\n     x: 0,\n     y: 0,\n     width: 100,\n  },\n  {\n     x: 123,\n     y: 45,\n     width: 10,\n  },\n  {\n     x: -45,\n     y: -410,\n     width: -123,\n  },\n];\n```\nvs\n\n```\nconst arrayOfRects = [\n  { x:   0, y:    0, width:  100, },\n  { x: 123, y:   45, width:   10, },\n  { x: -45, y: -410, width: -123, },\n];\n```\n\nI prefer the last one depending on the situation. There are plenty of places where turning the data into something more like a table makes it much much easier to find errors and see exceptions but auto formaters normal destroy such formatting.\n\nIn the same way I'd expect issues with VPLs in that people want to arrange their nodes the way that works best for them, not on some auto-layed out way. Consider 6 nodes that could be stacked vertically, horizontally, 3x2, 2x3 or just manually placed wherever. Now two or more people move the nodes and you've got a conflict that needs resolving.\n\nMaybe not a good example. I'm just trying to point out that just like an code AST generally removes all formatting info which is often an issue, VPLs probably also have similar types of metadata that will end up causing similar issues.",

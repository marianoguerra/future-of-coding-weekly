And since the creation of a new language, which is often what is really being attempted in a future of coding project, this group is a wonderful collection of some of the people working on new languages. Some of the projects already have hundreds of users (like the Luna and Red languages), so they don't spend much time here. But for researchers and projects not yet out in the open and actively growing their user base to that critical 1000 user base that is so elusive, this is a great place to be. It takes thousands of hours to start up a new ecosystem, and the more radical and powerful the advance is, the harder it will be, because a major leap will be so disruptive as to invite attacks from traditionalists. Thankfully there are few such people here.",

He suggests that that vision assumes that a system (s) can just \"emerge\" from many objects, rather than having a holistic top-down design (because that's what happens in biology: amazingly complex and adapted systems emerge and evolve from these amazing structures called cells). Essentially, if all the objects just \"do the right thing\", the whole system will just work (and hence SmallTalk being centered on editing \/ reflecting on individual objects -- oops, I mean classes).\n\nMuch traditional \"OO\" code is built this way: all the objects (er, classes (oops!)) are designed to \"do the right thing\" (play their part on the whole system), which means that the behavior of the whole system is exploded into pieces, and divided up about the different (classes) (you do part A, you do part B), and the result is that there is no clear model for the system (or any one behavior\/ use case) that can be reasoned about as a whole.\n\nHe makes the analogy between all these classes, and an Egyptian pyramid which is \"just all the building materials stacked on top of each other\" (e.g. as compared to a cathedral, which is mostly empty space).\n\nHe proposes DCI as a (temporary -- \"finger in the dike\") fix to the OO vision by offering a \"context\" container to house behaviors that span multiple objects, with the roles that each object-participant plays being defined as part of the context, rather than as part of the class that each participating object.",

I try to capture system behaviors (i.e. pieces of the human model \/ use cases) as single coherent whole pieces rather than chopping then up along classes; but I don't see a need to try to do that in an OO way, e.g. still associating each piece with an individual role.

Some people should not drive a car ). The problem with teaching how to drive a car was solved by a person needed to pass driving rules exam.

All so should be able to own &amp; shape their own tools &amp; environment in whatever way (and to whatever extent) makes sense. That can (and should) mean LOTS of things *other* than dealing with raw code.\n\n* We can use reflection to code unanticipated scenarios\n\nThe intent is that code already written (and compiled) can be supplied with a new \"instance\" that was not defined previously, and still work. So there's code saying \"give me some X that has behavior Y, and I'll tell it when to do Y\". You can then give it some new definition of X that it never heard of, even long after it was built &amp; compiled, and it works. Traditional class-based-OO does this with interfaces &amp; abstract base classes \/ virtual methods; but there are other ways, such as dynamic types, ST-style message passing -- heck, even HTTP REST qualifies as that style of message passing.\n\nFor me, that's more about how do you properly design a system in terms of composable units, rather than using some clever polymorphic mechanism. I think that a lot of times the latter is an over-used \/ abused substitute for the first. E.g. using inheritance and interfaces to glue parts of code together that should have been coherent whole units to begin with. Or having poor software design such that one thinks that inheritance and overrides are necessary to be able to change the code in the future, versus having coherent code that is easy to understand and make direct modifications to to begin with.\n\n* Local reflection ... similar to the above.\n\n* Self organization is the order of the day\n\nI agree with Jim that this is a dead-end substitute for actual concrete system design.

Green is life, way to grow, prevail. Yellow is a transitional color between them. The colors were found naturally. Out of real emotional attachment to other things in life besides road traffic regulation. When it comes to transfer knowledge of computer to everyone, one would need to find things connecting to other aspects of life. Cache is absolutely nothing to most people. Meta data is also far out.

        "text": "Glamorous Toolkit has so much work behind it to make all those wonderful little windows and graphs. I see problems ahead however, as the OOP paradigm underlying Pharo has some inherent aspects that make it extremely difficult to achieve interchangeable parts, which is what i believe is one of the main pillars of the future. I think that one should design from the standpoint of interchangeable parts, and then calculate backwards what a language must look like to allow such a phenomenon to exist.",

Would you like to detail your concern?\n\nIn any case, while the graphical stack has interesting properties, Glamorous Toolkit puts forward the concept of a moldable development environment. We see the IDE as a language that combines and extends the host language. Reusability of components is secondary to programmability because we believe that the development experience must be contextual. To this end, when practicing moldable development, we create tools for each of our problems. When working like that, the inner workings of systems become explainable and approachable even by less technical people. So, the key aspect is moldability and Glamorous Toolkit is a specific instantiation of that.",

Almost the same thing except that I was trying to figure out how to support cyclic dependencies, like in a temperature converter, how to update the \"fahrenheit\" box when you change the \"celcius\" box and vice versa. I didn't entirely figure out that part...).\n\nWhile various other visual aids are useful, reactivity is the big thing in my mind.

That's inconvenient!\n\nWrapping arbitrary cmd-line apps sounds to me like a harder problem than building the feature into the programming language \/ standard library... but I don't really understand what it does just by looking at the gif in the readme.",

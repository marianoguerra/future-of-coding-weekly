        "text": "Yep. The idea of separating \"software engineering\" and \"programming language design\" as different subjects is kind of horrifying. Design has to be informed by studying use exactly as you are doing.\n\nI don't think a lot of the claims about programming language features e.g. advanced type systems and purity are evidence based. I think we need to rebrand PL design away from theory and mathematics to something pragmatic based on data from observations e.g. call it \"PL Engineering\".\n\nSize of project is definitely a factor for understanding language features. You just don't face problems that matter in primitive languages on toy projects. There is a hierarchy of comfort something like:\n\n`    100 LOC` - asm\n`   1000 LOC` - dynamic types\n`  10000 LOC` - static types\n` 100000 LOC` - modules\n`1000000 LOC` - package managers\n\nI won't experience much pain writing up to 1000 lines of a dynamically typed language but I'd refuse to write 100k+ lines without static types, generics, lambdas, refactoring tools, profilers and static analysis tools etc.",

        "text": "An idea for an exercise that might be fun:\n- have a 3 hour work shop to build a little game\n- everyone starts on their own machine\n- every 15 minutes, a whistle blows and they have to get up and move to the machine on their left and continue building the game based on their neighbour's progress\n- everyone reviews the history of each project to work out why some projects proceeded faster than others\n\nMight learn a little bit about language design and readability \/ safety but more about engineering practices. I think students would quickly invent a lot of strategies for how to leave incomplete work e.g. inline documentation about what they were aiming to achieve.",

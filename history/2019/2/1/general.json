It is reported as being carried on by its main designer Julien Verlaguet. I haven't had a chance to review it yet to see what it added to the mix, but it was another substantial effort like Eve, and anyone working on their own project, should at least glance over and see what happened to other teams. Facebook is notoriously fickle about projects and products; they are a dictatorship, and subject to whims of the management.",

And the iPad has amazing stuff in the music real. However, one thing i don't like about those tools is they are age discriminatory, because nobody much older than 35 is going to be able to read those tiny icons and controls. I think companies should be fined for making products that hamper older people. We are very sensitive in the USA to wheelchair access, but i daily lament the trend toward low contrast interfaces with faint shades of gray icons that are teeny. We need to make programming more inclusive, and make interfaces size adjustable. The ability to program on a small screen is only limited by our ingenuity, however, during debugging of a larger program, a big monitor is frankly a must.",

        "text": "In Microsoft Assembler programming, the debugger had the ability to watch a piece of memory and pause the execution at the instruction that was modifying that object, thus allowing you to back-trace from the effect to the cause. This has been around since early days of computers. I think the technical term is WatchPoints, but different language has been used over this long span of time. Unfortunately with object oriented programming, it is very difficult to set a watchpoint on an object's properties when the object doesn't exist yet. This is therefore one of my main objections to the entire OOP paradigm, that it precludes triggering a stop to examine things on a data transition. Languages which have no allocation (no new, no dispose) and are static in structure are so much easier to debug. If you look at the RAM map of a typical object oriented program, its like a bucket of vomit.",

        "text": "It is a sad fact that Apple, which took the Nokia touchscreen invention and ran with it to massive success, has blocked touchscreen evolution in their desktop OS, and let MS push forward in that area. And because Mac OSX programming is a substantial home of programming (90% in web), touch interfaces have not developed there. We see it all the time in sci-fi movies where people interact with their hands with computers very fluidly, and if apple will stop blocking it the whole touch thing could take off, but for now you have to offer a mouse fallback, and frankly you can't build a touchy feely interface and a mouse one, it is just too hard to reconcile the very different aspects; one is very precise but only has 2 buttons typically, and the other has many gestures possible which cannot be mapped to a mouse easily. For my IOS apps i never asked for more than tap, because i found that people are lousy at knowing how fast to double tap, and you can't discover gesture support in a program, so some fancy gesture command will never happen. In order for touch to work, you have to train millions of customers in a very consistent interaction movements, not an easy thing. Touch interfaces will thus continue to roll out slowly over the next 20 years. Voice interfaces will end up winning anyway because it is so easy and takes no coordination at all.",

        "text": "If you look at the computer hardware, we have either ARM or Intel architecture CPU's in 99.9% of all computers. This architecture is at its core, a one dimensional instruction pointer flying at light speed through the code segments. It hops via branches, and then pushes\/pops in and out of subroutines. This jumpy nature is extremely hard to make into simple motion. Your visual language to be understandable thus must stray very far from the machine. This is one of the reasons why visual languages have been such a bear. It is an intrinsically very difficult problem, and the closer one gets to the CPU the more jumpy and chaotic things will appear, thus some serious tradeoffs and abstractions have to be introduced. There are aspects of program development that are very amenable to graphical representation, and i am of the opinion that a graphical approach can be of benefit especially in the area of tweaking parameters to make things look nice, and quickly laying out interfaces. There are wonderful prototyping tools that really should just go the extra mile and generate good code.",

It also is evidently a transpiler to JS as well as a compiled language. That must have been a lot of work to reconcile those two universes (presuming they use LLVM or something to emit machine code). This was obviously a huge project, representing millions in R&amp;D dollars. From first glance they embraced OOP as a paradigm, and that might have been one of their downfalls.",

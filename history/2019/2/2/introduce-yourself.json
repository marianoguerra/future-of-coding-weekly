        "text": "<@UEQ6M68H0> Interesting you mention Aarvo Paart. Yes, certainly I’ve heard about how meditative and mystical his work is. I have been searching for this kind of “transcendent” experience and finding it in a diverse range of others including Somei Satoh, Toru Takemitsu, Lilli Boulanger, John Luther Adams, Gyorgi Ligeti and sometimes with the “night music” aspect of Bella Bartok. I haven’t quite gotten into Aarvo Paart yet, but now that you bring him up, I think I’ll give him another listen this week and try to have an open mind. Thanks for mentioning.",

        "text": "The Requiem by Maurice Durflé is a killer work. He takes you straight to heaven. If you are interested in mystic music, you might look at Scriabin's piano works. He was working on a super-work called the Mysterium that would cause spontaneous enlightenment. He was a very interesting fellow. Also post-awakening John Coltrane is wonderful stuff. Myself for programming i used Anoushka Shankar to power the first year of my project. She's better than her father was, and he was great. Rhythmic music helps with typing.",

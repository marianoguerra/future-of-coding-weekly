        "text": "Here is an idea explaining the algorithm for linked list. Group of people, a robe in a length of exactly 20 feet. The road. The tree at the end of the road. How can someone from the group to go towards the tree and stop exactly 20 feet from it?  Exercise at first might have an idea to go all away to the tree, place the robe there that measure the distance and the other end of the road will be the place to stop. Modification for  more optimal decision would be two people holding a robe and walking towards the tree with a robe between them. Once the leading person gets to the tree, the one behind is standing where we wanted to be. Just came to me as possible way to explain. So not know how useful it is but things like that can be taught to children at early age. ",

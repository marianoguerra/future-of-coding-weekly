        "text": "This is a great article. The things vs. dependencies dichotomy is a powerful insight and resonates strongly with me, who has always been vary of too many dependencies. The “getting an old web app to run” example describes succinctly why I think today’s web has serious issues beyond repair.\n\nI’m not sure about the link to scarcity and abundance. This seems more like describing the shadows thrown on the wall by the real reason. And as you might expect I believe the real reason to be rooted in business models (<https:\/\/twitter.com\/stefanlesser\/status\/1188384797510586368>)*. That aligns with the points he makes about SaaS vs. Bitcoin.\n\nIn summary I think each of us today is in a great position where we can choose to blindly build on infrastructure that “isn’t ours” and we only shallowly understand but make impressive progress, or go back and refine and simplify the stack, make it easier to understand, but solve boring infrastructural problems that have been solved already, just not well enough.\n\n*) I posted the wrong tweet before and changed it now, but the preview here in Slack is still the wrong one.

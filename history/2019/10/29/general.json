        "text": "It is amusing to me that his laptop has an Erlang sticker, when Joe Armstrong, the inventor had such a dim view of the Actor model. There is a lively reunion on YouTube of three famous senior UK computer scientists who each selected a different technology to pursue. One was Hewitt, the actor model, and Armstrong, and Hoare who had some other paradigm i forget which. Anyway they had a debate about what were the results, and Armstrong ripped them to shreds because he pointed out that is system worked and theirs didn't actually work. Pharo has the best IDE i have ever seen, but the underlying language smalltalk was DOA (dead on arrival). The original editions of the smalltalk book by Goldberg are worth a lot, because sensible people like me who bought that book tossed it out because the language is so clunky and hard to read, and frankly absurd. You send the message PLUS to the number 3 along with another operator 2, and then the 3 updates itself to 5. That isn't too far out, but when you get to bitmap manipulation, the model really gets ugly.\n\n The actor model creates not only huge numbers of little islands of state, but then compounds that mistake by creating a message passing system that is hell to debug. In any toolchain that becomes hypercomplex to understand, there are always exceptional people who claim it is no problem, but if you take a big actor model program, and pass it to another programmer, they will have zero chance of understanding it. It becomes a nightmare of dependencies and cross-connections, just like the human body.\n\nI only make these possibly inflammatory remarks to warn people to look up Armstrong's talk, and think twice about wasting your time on a model that has such a legacy of failure.    If someone would like to debate this with me, we can have Steve Krouse act as referee, and hold a fire extinguisher nearby so when you burst into flames you won't be permanently harmed ;-&gt;",

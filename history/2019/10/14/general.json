        "text": "<@UJBAJNFLK> Thanks for the clarification. I guess that the definition of a language primitive is: if you implement a primitive in the source language itself, you induce a meta-circular dependency on the language implementation. Non-primitives can be implemented in terms of primitives without creating this kind of circularity. Meta-circular definitions of language primitives are not just a party trick. They are necessary if you want to implement an operating system that runs on top of the bare metal, and if you also want to use that same language &amp; operating system to develop newer versions of itself. The C compiler is written in C. <@ULM3U6275> I agree with your sentiment. Implementing a language in itself, all the way down to the bare metal, is possible, but then you take on the job of supporting all modern hardware, which is a huge commitment.",

        "text": "Mathematica being the only commonly used symbolic system, has arbitrary precision available. Excel, the most commonly used programming tool offers protected arithmetic. COBOL, the most derided tool still in use, offers BCD arithmetic, where 0.1 + 0.2 does equal 0.3, (which it does not in IEEE floating point). There are a lot of choices for arithmetic, and it is a very interesting, and fundamentally very important design decision for any language. In my Beads language i offer physical units of measurement which stores the exponents of the fundamental units along with the magnitude of a number, so that when you multiply  kg times meters you have a quantity with mass^1 • length^1, and this is maintained at runtime, so as to support catching mistakes in units both at compile time and more importantly at runtime, which per Van Snyder of JPL is the 3rd most common error in engineering and scientific software. I recently announced this feature to the scientist subgroup of Reddit and got heaps of abuse from scientists who claimed that they never make units mistakes, and couldn't possibly tolerate the additional overhead of storing such things. I was quite surprised by the negative reaction to this very clever implementation of a desired feature from the 70's, and it has taught me that violent opposition to any fundamental change is going to happen. Offering too many kinds of numbers in languages (like INT8 INT16, INT32, INT64) is a hangover from the 70's when you spent a lot of time figuring out how many bytes each field should take, and carefully trimmed field sizes so as to take minimum space. Those days are long gone, and in the JS world, you only have FLOAT64. Too bad IEEE floating point is so stupid, as pointed out in the wonderful talks by Douglas Crockford on its many intrinsic flaws.  It is very hard to fix this nasty problem because of interchange issues, where really we need to change all at once to a better format. That might not happen for another 20 years at the rate we are going.",

In fact, the problem mostly comes from different people tacitly assuming different conventions, so people who use only code they wrote themselves are perhaps in a better situation.\nCalling IEEE FP stupid is a sign of... stupidity. A lot of careful thought has gone into that specification, which is a good fit for what it was designed for (scientific computing). People who barely understand it and use it for accounting get the punishment they deserve. The real problem with IEEE FP is that it is commonly presented (in programming tutorials) as \"real numbers\" making people believe in properties that IEEE FP doesn't have.",

Software doesn’t have to be synonymous with applications, and there is great potential to be unlocked if we break out of them. In this talk, I will argue for a renewed focus on developing computational media and show efforts we have undertaken to demonstrate how software can be made differently. I will, among other things, present our work on Webstrates (<http:\/\/webstrates.net|webstrates.net>), its authoring environment\nCodestrates (<http:\/\/codestrates.org|codestrates.org>), and a data visualization environment built using these called Vistrates (<http:\/\/vistrates.org|vistrates.org>).\n\nBio:\nClemens Nylandsted Klokmose is an associate professor in the Department of Digital Design and Information Studies at Aarhus University.

Substrates are software artifacts that embody content, computation and interaction, effectively blurring the distinction between documents and applications. Substrates can evolve over time and shift roles, acting as what are traditionally considered documents in one context and applications in another, or a mix of the two. Substrates may be composed in various ways, e.g., one substrate can give meaning and structure to another. For example, a bar-chart substrate can define how to visualize a statistical data substrate.",

If you're looking for something analogous to a stateful interactive doc or non-linear presentation this would be the tool for you.\n\nAnyways, would really love feedback on the tool itself, and the way we're describing ourselves. We've described ourselves as a \"simple app builder\", \"micro-experience creator\" and \"interactive presentation\" before. It seems that in FoC land it's actually quite difficult to describe to end users what you're building. We've found that a seemingly straightforward descriptions like \"app builder\" to us, often means nothing to an end user.",

Letting people distribute these apps as a link (or eventually bundle of HTML files, images, etc) is really important to us. In fact, we hope to let people effectively build progressive web apps with these documents\/apps at some point.",

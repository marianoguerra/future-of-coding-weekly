        "text": "Macros are used extensively in Assembler, and one of the key tools is to see a printout of the expanded code ,because complex macros can do unpredictable things. This is the reason why macros which were present 50 years ago in great abundance have gradually withered. There is little interest now in seeing printouts of your code, and people are working more directly with their source code, thus Macros are inconvenient because they force a user to expand the macro in their head. This is really about a super powerful feature that is being disused today, because we don't print code out like in olden days.",

You have a multi-step computation in which each step takes the output of the preceding one as one of its inputs. This point of view also covers related approaches such as code generation.",

        "text": "This classic distinction between compile and run time made me wonder if there are other “times”, and I like the idea of generalizing it. If you think about it a little differently than what Racket generalizes it for, say for a program lifecycle: \n\n1. You design it (think, write code), where the development environment can support you, \n2. Then it gets compiled, where a compiler supports you with error detection and optimization (this can be further divided into smaller, more specific steps, which is what Racket does and what you were discussing above in terms of macros), \n3. Then there's configuration time, when you start a process with parameters that are not hard coded into the binary but also guaranteed not to change over the process' lifetime, \n4. And then there's runtime, which of course could also consist of several distinct phases if you designed it that way.\n\nThat reminds me a lot of currying in a functional language, where each curried parameter is the current lifecycle stage’s “state” in a chain from hard coded design time invariances until you get to the runtime parameter for user input in that moment. Ha, game programmers could probably think of each frame as a stage within the broader runtime phase.\n\nOr if you don’t like the functional perspective think of a dynamic program that goes deeper into a stack of scopes, where each scope holds the environment for that particular stage and can access all the environments up the chain.\n\nDoes that sound familiar to anyone? Do you know any papers or talks that think of it in this way?",

All steps offer various degrees of tinkering, even a tool chain has different settings, so the programmer can be involved in every step.\n\nEspecially the first step, design, benefits from a toolset which augments that experience. And that is where IDEs could shine much more than they do today. Thinking in the direction of “moldable tools”. On further reflection, that is where this lifecycle becomes an actual cycle I guess…",

In the third phase, these functions are compiled into GLSL shader code, which is run on the GPU in the fourth phase. During 3rd phase compilation, many compile time constants were actually computed during 2nd phase evaluation. So 2nd phase evaluation could be viewed as a kind of partial evaluation.",

It means that all arguments are passed to functions as uninterpreted syntax trees. A lexical environment is also passed in every function call. Most functions will just evaluate their arguments using the parent lexical environment, but some functions will do weird stuff. For example, `lambda` is just a function in this system, since macros and functions are the same. `lambda(x,x+1)` is a lambda expression which binds the first argument, an identifier, as a local variable in the environment of the second argument, an expression, and then returns an ordinary function.",

        "text": "Mark Twain was the first author to submit a manuscript in typewritten form. He invested in an early typewriter. Given that you had no erase functions in early typewriters, it was the precision task of a secretary to spell and type accurately. As we invented the ability to erase mistakes, the need for a skilled typist gradually disappeared. Now with autocorrection, people can be awful spellers and the world will never know. You are correct that as computer programming gets easier, there will be less need for professional programmers, as simple programs will be done by end users. If you think about it, every day devices get more computerized, and users take more of the load off technicians. A mainframe computer would take 1 person 30 minutes to start up, now your cellphone can reboot in less than a minute, and all you gotta do is remember the keypress sequence to get it going or shut it down (if you even bother shutting it down)",

But then the ending has a twist, pointing out that even if you're entirely romanticist when thinking about the next release, thinking more long-term forces you to reintroduce the classicist viewpoint.\n\nTo me the conclusion seems inescapable in the context of this channel: end-user programming is fundamentally about giving people a sense of architecture, and of teaching them this without them noticing.\n\nProgramming isn't like motorcycles at all, something fewer and fewer people hack on over time. It's more like typing, an activity that used to be restricted to professionals but now performed self-service by everyone.",

        "text": "software is malleable like sand is malleable. Software has a very tiny cell size, like sand, and as such is very tedious to construct anything. It is not really a flexible material, it is merely a microscopic rigid material, and has to be used in great abundance to achieve good things. The fact that we are not in an era of interchangeable parts means that people have to build their castles over and over custom made, instead of using pre-fab small pieces like lego. Lego is arguably the greatest toy ever invented, founded on the 8 bump brick which snaps together in many ways, but always perfectly. We need better data interchange between pieces and then it will be a much more flexible medium. It's not locked down really; none of the pieces snap together that well.",

        "text": "Hi all! I've been working on a web development platform called Boomla for 14 years, I'm sort of coming out of the bush these days. <https:\/\/boomla.com\/> I also call it a Website OS as it is a platform where websites are first-class citizens.\nIt is a server-side platform, with its own object-oriented filesystem, functional execution model, package management solution, etc. It can currently be programmed in JavaScript on the server, but it will support multiple languages in the future.\nIt also provides a drag&amp;drop user-interface for end-users to let them build websites. But that's optional, you could build a different frontend for it.\nIt has a web based IDE and lots of documentation. I made the decision early to focus on the platform and not write any new programming language. :smile:\nIt was designed to be low on maintenance. The platform is fast and rock solid stable. Developers tend to agree that the most interesting part of the system is the object oriented filesystem with lots of interesting properties.\nI'm glad for the existence of the group, looking forward to interesting conversations!",

Or were it initially seen as a polytechnic trade or craft, rather than an avenue to research mathematics and physics. Imagine if the computational substrate were emergent from nature, like leather or fabric, rather than emergent from mechanics and electronics — how that would change the dissemination of knowledge and practice in the early days. (I don't mean emergent from \"fiber arts\" — I know about card weaving and there's a loom in my house. I mean emergent from fiber itself.)",

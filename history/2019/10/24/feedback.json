        "text": "Hey Parris, some quick first impressions: I find this line to be kind of confusing: \"Old document creators print to paper. This one publishes to phone.\". People are already pretty comfortable with docs being online, so not sure the paper reference works.\n\nMaybe something more like \"Don't just write a doc, tell a story\" (prob not good either, but just a thought).\n\nI like the second paragraph except for \"documents should be the next best thing to a conversation.\". Don't really know what that means.\n\nAnimated GIFs are a nice touch. This looks really slick and I can totally get why someone might use this instead of a Google Doc if they're trying to present or persuade.\n\nI do like the comparison to docs (or maybe slideshows?) over calling it a \"simple app builder\" or \"micro-experience creator\". Lots of people make docs\/slideshows, probably no one is thinking \"I want to make a tiny app\".",

        "text": "Just posted a handy color picker utility web app written in beads that lets you copy a color name or Hex value to the clipboard. It sorts the colors nicely, and resizes to a very wide range of window sizes. I believe that it is within 20% of the theoretical minimum program word count to achieve this task. 0 external dependencies, and only about a dozen functions total, how much simpler can it get? Anyway please check out the code at <https:\/\/github.com\/magicmouse\/beads-examples\/tree\/master\/Example%20-%20Color%20Picker> or just use the utility at <http:\/\/beadslang.com\/apps\/color_picker\/picker.html>",

To erase the screen you had to press a zap button. The image was rock solid though, as it was etched in slow phosphors, so no flicker at all... It came with two clumsy thumbwheels for XY input, before they had trackballs and mice. Even more astonishing, it had a thermal printer that printed the screen for you in grayscale in a few seconds. Developed for the military, it was such great gear, and Tektronix was and probably still is a great company with excellent products.",

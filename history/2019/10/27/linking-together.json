I also agree photo editing is in the process of being disrupted these days, and that's also an interesting phenomena, but that's the inverse of Superhuman, there a more specialized skill is in the process of becoming democratized, e.g., Apple folded their tool for professional photographers, Aperture, into their built-in photo tool for everyone, Photos.",

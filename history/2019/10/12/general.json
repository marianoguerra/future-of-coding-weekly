        "text": "20 million is a lot of money. If i recall correctly Eve raised 2.3 million from Andreesen Horowitz, and the Luna team just raised 2 million for their second round, and the Red team via an ICO raised an unknown amount, probably in the tens of millions.  So 2 million gets you about a team of 6 people for 2-3 years, depends on the country of course. Red is pursuing a multi-platform initial release, so they have higher costs and a larger team. the best way to do this type of funding is to put at least 3 parallel competing teams on the same general project area, and whichever one looks the most promising after N months gets increased funding and the other teams are disbanded. This was the general methodology used so successfully under Thomas J. Watson Jr. who presided over the most successful and excellent tech company the world has ever seen. I know that most of you folks don't know how great IBM was, but they were amazing, and for a near monopoly, while Watson was in charge, the company was of the highest integrity and innovative like no other. After he retired it was ruined as a company, they became gutless and lazy. They are only a shadow of their former selves. But anyway back to this idea, by having competing teams you get peoples' juices going. A race is far more exciting than a country club atmosphere with no deadlines and a steady paycheck you won't get much. Look at how little gets accomplished in France. They are so smart, but so far behind in programming. I think it is just too comfortable. I had a friend David who tried working in Paris and couldn't stand the lack of motivation and quit his cushy job. If you are not going to have a VC breathing down your neck, at least put some danger into the process by having some competition. Some of the greatest creations in history were done very quickly. Like building the Pentagon (under 1 year), or the most impressive musical composition feat in a short time period in history, Donizetti's Don Pasquale which was done in just in a handful of weeks, which if you ever go to a big public library and see the score, you would be hard pressed to copy by hand that score in the time he took to write it. Nobody has ever done an opera of that quality in what amounted to just a few days.  <@U5TCAFTD3> , i suggest you study the biography of Thomas J. Watson, as he directed some of the most productive R&amp;D, and was quite a forceful personality without being a chair thrower, etc. Hewlett &amp; Packard were also superb tech managers and developers; actually very few great leaders in computer history. If you just throw money into a project without a strong plan, you get poor results. Take a gander at the doomed california high speed rail project for an example of how not to run a project. They spent billions, and accomplished nothing useful. Or the hot fusion projects of the last 30 years, which have promised fusion in 10 years for the last 30 years straight. Many R&amp;D projects fail, so I thing Watson had the most practical approach to solving an important problem.",

It's really no different from (e.g. can be accomplished via) ordinary programming techniques using functions + data-structures + abstraction, etc. And since code can be represented as data-structures, the whole world of programming can fit into things like lists and key-value stores. You really don't need anything more than that for anything!\n\nAs for the DB, you can code up whatever model works best instead, or you have something that translates your \"ideal model\" into code that creates and populates a DB and the code interface to it.

Expressions are LISP-like (list of operation + arguments), but the interpreter\/evaluator simply looks up ALL operations in a \"context\" object (which represents lexical scope and may reference a \"parent\" context -- think Scheme).\n\nFunctions can be native, or consist of objects that contain the code to evaluate, the arguments it takes, and the context (scope) in which to do so (typically same as lexical scope of the function).\n\nThe entire system (evaluator, a compiler, base operations like get, set, +, -, etc.) are all defined in a \"root\" context, which is not different from any other manipulatable entity. The evaluator was originally written natively (JavaScript for now), but then rewritten in \"objects\".\n\nThe goal was to rewrite everything that way, and have code that regenerates the native code for the whole system which, when run, recreates everything as it was at the time. This mostly just means spitting out the static data-structure for the whole thing, inserting a native evaluator (by feeding it into the compiler) which is then invoked immediately on some code to bootstrap the UI.\n\nFrom that point, you can reshape the whole thing just by interacting with the running program -- and that will allow me to evolve it further without ever looking at the \"source code\" again!\n\nThe only remaining \"native\" code (other than the base operations) was the logic in the compile function to convert code to JavaScript. But hey, I could (using the tool itself) make a compiler for something else (e.g. assembly, .NET, JVM) and supply the level base operations for it, and then boot up the entire system (in the same state) on something else!\n\nI took it too far with how minimal I wanted the native set to be (e.g. defining \"lookup\" in terms of objects, when that's a key function that the compiler injects everywhere), and forcing a CPS model under the hood sooner than I should have. It just became very difficult to manage, and stuff started to blow up when I got 90% of the way through rewriting it in itself ... I might go back some day and replay some of my development with different decisions.\n\nI'd been developing and interact with this entirely though the browser debugger, leaving the UI as an afterthought for after the base system was working properly. I knew I'd need some primitive graphical operations that could translate to any system -- just whatever is minimally sufficient to bootstrap a minimal foot-in-the-door UI, because then I could just use the UI to improve the UI code. ... But as stated, I never got to the UI.\n\nMy \"Interact\" project starts from the UI first and will work backwards to eventually bootstrap itself into that UI. It's essentially becoming a do-over of \"Objects\", though I might come back to that model eventually and reconcile them. ... I'll describe \"Interact\" next",

So the minimal UI would just expose the raw structure of everything, and provide a way to execute \/ evaluate code. (That's not the end goal, but I'll get back to that later)\n\nEntities (strings, numbers, lists, functions, etc.) sit freely on a canvas, where they can be moved around, inspected, expanded\/collapsed, etc.\n\nDragging values onto a function causes the function to be evaluated with those \"arguments\", and the result appears as a new entity on the canvas. Since there is a function for every basic operation, this is sufficient for making every kind of manipulation *possible* (but not necessarily ideal - I'll get back to that!)\n\n(Certain basic things like getting or setting a value could be as simple as drag-and-drop; but I'll get a working tool first, and then use the tool itself to see what works best for what -- let's call that \"phase 2\")\n\nEither way (e.g. whether the UI \"helps\" or not), any sequence of operations that can be done -- whether through user interaction or by evaluating \"code\" -- directly corresponds to sequence of (nested or otherwise) function calls. Therefore, by recording and replaying actions taken, all code can be created and viewed as direct interactions, rather than as the textual or structural representation one normally thinks of as \"code\". *(From here I might use \"code\" and \"actions\" interchangeably)\n\nSo essentially you can do a bunch of manipulations, and then say \"See what I did? Call that a function, and THIS value here is the result\". And then edit the *actions and\/or the object that represents the new function to replace certain values with arguments, etc.\n\nNow whereas \"normal\" code references values by identifiers (e.g. looking up variables by name), the user is able to just \"grab\" values that are just sitting there. So under the hood, code is stored as a list of actions, which contain either simple values or the index of some other action (referring to the result of that action) ... In other words, it's a DAG.\n\nWhen viewing \/ editing a function, actual values are substituted from the arguments, and you are shown the \"aftermath\" of the actions (i.e. values on a canvas), as if you had performed all the actions yourself. Changing any actions or values causes the whole thing to recompute (think FRP)\n\nThis means that any operation you do becomes part of the current \"function\" you are editing. I'll provide a way to \"cut\" dependencies though, so you can use the canvas as an interactive REPL, and then either throw out the results, or \"forget\" how it was computed and just use the generated value directly. I could also have a \"cleanup\" that will throw out all intermediate operations that did not contribute to the ultimate result of the function.\n\nAll editing is done in a function, so even the \"top level\" (global scope) is a \"function\" with its own record of actions taken. This also means that all the work of \"programming\" you do is recorded as some step somewhere, giving you multiple layers of undo\/redo.  Anything you do can be abstracted into a function and edited for generic reuse. E.g. \"Here's how I do x to the code\"\n\n... Anyway, I'm getting lost in low-level specifics. I'll tie this up in another reply",

The benefit is that whatever \"nice way\" is found to represent or edit something, can be immediately applied to itself to make it easier to make things easier, etc.\n\nOne thing I'll provide to that end, is the idea of a custom \"view\". What I've described for viewing and editing functions is just one such \"view\", which is different than viewing a \"function\" as raw JSON. But perhaps something is better viewed as a table, or a graph, or some other interactive visualization.\n\nA custom view will contain whatever code is necessary to render something, and respond to interaction. This will probably \"just be code\", but (for example) there's no reason there couldn't be a custom view for specifying views using some custom DSL.\n\nAnd that brings me to another major goal of this tool:\n\nThings like DSLs, macros, syntax, even \"programming language\" (compiling, interpreting, translating), ... these can all be fluid things defined by ordinary code. The only difference is when and where it happens. But in a system like this, everything is the result of some \"actions\" taken to create it. So there's always some \"code\" that specifies how your code got created. And there's no reason to treat *that* code any differently!\n\nExpanding this further, with all the possible ways to view and edit \"code\" (or anything else), there's no reason to distinguish between \"code\" and a UI widget with its own custom behavior. No fundamental difference between a macro or a compiler, and anything else that let's you specify or view code\/data one way, and then generate it another way.",

I don't think the future of computing is going to target niche markets like ML or exascale computing; those are best left to specialized toolchains custom made for that sort of thing. You could start by giving a product to clone, saying make me facebook in 3000 man hours, or pick some popular game, etc. Jonathan Blow's very clever Jai programming language is custom built around making his next game. The language does exactly what he needs for that game. And since it is a complex game, the language is pretty complex, and fairly low level as he is shooting for low power consoles like the Nintendo switch.",

What I learned from it was that while it's cool to be able to modify plumbing all the way down, there are extremely subtle implications for correctness and performance that the environment as a whole isn't equipped to support debugging. And arguably _couldn't possibly_ support. So it doesn't seem worth chasing or bragging about. Just stick to 5% or 1% that isn't introspectable. To do otherwise is status signalling at best.",

But maybe this needs a separate thread in  <#C5U3SEW6A|random>. It's not a huge disagreement that I feel a need to explore.",

In Pharo, you accomplish this by making a copy of the system, and modifying the copy. It's described in the 2014 paper I linked. This paper mentions some limitations (eg, on making changes to how SmallInteger and the boolean values work), due to the original system and the copy sharing the same VM data structures and byte code format, but there's been a lot of new work on the Pharo bootstrapping system since then that I haven't read about yet. Maybe some of these limitations have been removed. It seems plausible that there is some boundary, but I don't know where the theoretical limits are.",

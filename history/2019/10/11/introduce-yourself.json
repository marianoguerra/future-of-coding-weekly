        "text": "You have done such a great job of making things pretty, and routing the wires nicely. But I think you have picked the wrong level of abstraction to diagram. You are drawing the microscopic local variables, yet in a program like Snake or TicTacToe (see <https:\/\/github.com\/magicmouse\/beads-examples>\n), one has the core model stored in some data structure which holds the source of truth, which for TicTacToe might be whose turn it is, what is in the 9 cells of the grid, etc., then you have the layout of the screen, which has its own data structures, and then you have user input events, which are not data but a stream of inputs driving the finite state machine of the game. There is negligible computation in this example, and if you diagram the functions you would make it less understandable. I like visual tools, but diagramming local variables and formal parameter inputs is too low level IMHO. Lots of things one could draw nicely, but the low level computation is perhaps the least interesting thing to show.",

Discovered the podcast recently, and hope to find more thought provoking resources here. (I don't think I'm going to attempt to build something myself anytime soon, but one never knows.)",

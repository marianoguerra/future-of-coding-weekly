When I say 'system' I mean not just the computer but the computer\/human\/physical interplay. We have agency and build stuff with tools, materials and complex machines called computers for goals that exist outside the machines. So the stuff we build doesn't have to be correct with respect to itself (~math proof) but really useful to *us*. If the 'types' correspond perfectly the reality being simulated, sure, the type checker gives us useful feedback. More often there is no perfect correspondence and problem is that the formalism cannot be tweaked to represent what we really need and cannot be selectively overridden. In extreme cases the formalism becomes the lens we look through to view reality - we have now lost our ability to even find the gaps between the formalisms and reality.",

        "text": "When working on Curv, I alternate between periods of language and API design, and periods of using the language to make art. My approach to language\/API design is formalistic, even using abstract algebra and category theory to justify design decisions. The order and symmetry is needed to keep the complexity of learning and using the language in check. The raw material used as input to that formalistic process sometimes comes from Hermeneutics. For example, \"Solve et Coagula\" (a motto from Alchemy) is a design principle. Then when I use Curv to create art, I'm writing code with some artistic intent and looking for the emergent behaviour, so that's hermeneutic as well. As a user, I insist on dynamic typing, not static typing -- formalist me doesn't have a say in this. I can't be the only person who is in both camps.",

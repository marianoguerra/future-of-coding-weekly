A language is a tool, and like a hammer which is great for nails but lousy at being a screwdriver, every language has its natural problem space where it excels. You are clearly very concerned with compactness and performance, as your language maps directly to the Intel instruction set (which has 99% market share in desktop computers, but ARM has 99% share in mobile devices). Wouldn't you be better off first picking some test programs you want to build, little utility things that represent the kinds of things you want to build, and then by working from both ends meet in the middle, like the golden spike of the transcontinental railroad of the USA. Working from both ends at once is the only way design can work; after all you always have at least 3 layers in a compiler system, the source syntax, the intermediate representation, and the target machine + runtime. With no runtime mentioned, i cannot figure out what this project is for. You clearly have spent a great deal of time thinking about and building stuff, but honestly i can't figure out the \"why\".",

My initial impression of tree notation is that it's all about trees, as the name implies. Trees can of course be used to encode pretty much anything (which I think is the main contribution of Lisp), including any type of cell universe. If that's what you are doing, please say so. Otherwise I wonder what role cells do play in tree notation, given that the main Web site does not use the term.",

Cells I think now only come up in Tree Language code (cells are placeholder for words and provide types, you'll see a \"cells\" keyword in the Tree Language called Grammar)...but the 2D register bit and \"tree machines\" is where this paper is headed, long term...",

        "text": "&gt; because if your users only understand things from the x86 level on up, they don't really understand things, imo\n\nHmm, not sure why you think this. You have to accept _some_ substrate.\n\nI'm not a fan of x86, but it is easily accessible for anyone who wants to try Mu out on a whim.\n\n&gt; Would it be correct to say Mu is a language that compiles to x86 Assembly, with the goal of being easier to use than direct x86, but not to be far removed from x86 so that the programmer is at all times aware of what the x86 machine is doing?\n\nYep! The Mu programmer can always bump down to machine code at a moment's notice, no matter how many levels of abstraction it gains over time. And all the tooling takes this capability for granted, so it can be less hermetically sealed and need less code at all levels of the stack.\n\nIf conventional stacks try to be like the _Starship Enterprise_, all gleaming chrome, Mu is designed like _Serenity_, with the ductwork hanging out.\n\n&gt; it may help to explain more x86...\n\nYeah, this is the fundamental underlying struggle. Currently the Mu Readme tries to provide a crash course on x86 in ~500 words: <https:\/\/github.com\/akkartik\/mu\/blob\/master\/Readme.md#lengthy-interlude-how-x86-instructions-compute-operands>. But I need to improve on that.\n\nThanks a lot for all the feedback, Breck!",

Again, I think it might be worth looking at RISC-V long term (or other competing open ISAs). Perhaps people would even go out and buy RISC-V boards just to use something like Mu. I know I would. I think otherwise your users will constantly run into the question, \"well why is there this instruction?\" and the answer will be \"because intel says so!\" and they will never be able to say \"how does this instruction *actually* get executed on the processer\" and they won't be able to say \"I'd like a new instruction, how can I go about it\"",

But nowadays every shipping chip includes the AMD x64 extensions, which AMD licensed back to Intel. It adds enough registers so that you aren't constantly shuffling data in and out of the measly 2 registers EAX and EBX. Remember that multiply uses the ECX EDX registers, so intel x86 really is a 2 general purpose register machine, and a huge percentage of instructions are loading and storing data from those registers. Another thing to consider is that most of the work Intel has been doing in the last 5 years with their instruction set is adding crazy instructions that have zero actual practical value, but are solely designed to confound and raise costs for the cloners in China, who have caught up with the basic instruction set, and sell cut-rate intel clone chips. The only useful instruction intel has added in the last 10 years is a true random number generator, which uses electron noise conditioned to produce the first actual random numbers for computers. Part of the AES extensions. But i would ignore the batshit crazy instructions like the GF2P8AFFINEINVQB — Galois Field Affine Transformation Inverse, which not one person in a million will ever use, much less understand.",

        "text": "okay i corrected my comment. I wrote 1% of my Discus labeler in intel assembler because i needed to do various bitmap masking operations that are not part of Win32, but  present in Quicktime; but that was 15 years ago. The MS Assembler is a fantastic tool, with macros for IF, WHILE, etc.,; and with macros you are really quite productive, and readable. Just don't forget to restore a register or else you will be hounded by phantom bugs! That's the reason people abandoned assembler. Otherwise it was quite productive, and incredibly efficient.",

        "text": "Another suggestion i have is to make the subset of Intel a bit more regular; in other words, tweak the intel architecture to fix the not-quite orthogonal instruction set. Add memory to memory moves for example (something so wonderful in the Motorola 68000 instruction set), and maybe offer more registers, etc. When Prof. N. Wirth made his Lilith computer, he created a compiler that generated code for the National chip, the Motorola 68k and the intel chip, and his code generator was smallest for the national chip, second best for motorola, and significantly bigger for the intel chip. Interestingly, the market success of the chips was inversely proportional to the easiest chip to program. There is strong evidence that whenever a major choices are made in the computer industry, the one that generates the most billable hours wins. This explains how COBOL beat out far superior languages, and why Java was selected, when it is an awful language.",

        "text": "&gt; You see lots of charts showing performance of various benchmarks, which is an obsession about run speed. Given how cheap and omnipresent computers are, the cost of the software development typically dwarfs any cost of execution.\n\nThe suggestion here seems to be that developers are optimizing without reason. Which might be the case or it might not. But in cases where you need to, its often the source of bugs, not *just* because of the programming language, but because optimizations depend on a stronger depth of knowledge concerning the platform. I imagine we have more papers on speed benchmarks because they approach being verifiable, as where studies on human productivity are probably a lot harder to compare.\n\nOn studies though, those that i have read have ranked Clojure very high. Higher then haskell in terms of having less bugs. As it's a lisp, i'm curious if you have any insight into how its doing so well given what i interpret as a somewhat bleak outlook on the LISP family.\n\n&gt; The large pool of people using a language is frankly of very little value much of the time for repair and improvement of a codebase. What help are outside people in updating some complex thing?\n\nThe community produces libraries that general have more well thought out and understandable abstractions. Being able to leverage those libraries and community experience is very valuable too me.",

        "text": "I am not saying that a large development community isn't helpful. It is very much so, as it is well known that the more users of a tool the fewer bugs you will encounter. Tiny communities like Modula2 which had only a few hundred people in the USA (it was a swiss languages) meant that you had a single compiler vendor for a platform, and if you hit a snag you had to plead mercy to get the runtime fixed. Using Microsoft toolchains means you had hordes of people beating on it, so you have a higher degree of polish on the tools. But when the product is already built, and you have some minor changes to make, the hordes of people who haven't seen your code base are of little impact.\n\nAs for Clojure, it is an interesting language. The recently defunct Eve project started in ClojureScript, which is a very productive language, and then switched to Rust if i am not mistaken. It would be interesting to hear from the team about their feelings about the switch. Rust is a much lower level language IMHO, more of a systems programming language compared to ClojureScript. I don't have any experience with it so i can't comment. However, there are plenty of blogs across the web expressing disillusionment with Clojure, so I would say that the problems of LISP remain.\n\n<https:\/\/medium.com\/@boxed\/my-disillusionment-with-clojure-and-lisps-9eca38ab7f0c>",

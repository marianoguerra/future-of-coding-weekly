        "text": "Dear Corey, i have published 4 specifications for short programs, why not try writing these 4 programs in Mech; after the programs are only in the 150 to 200 word range, that is about as short as it gets. Comparing 2 different languages with the exact same spec really gives people a clear idea of the differences between languages. Too often it is apples and oranges, because even the simplest programs can have quite a range of implementation details, and as we know, the devil is in the details.\n\n<https:\/\/github.com\/magicmouse\/beads-examples>",

        "text": "Since John Backus invented his Red programming language (never released publicly) around 1972, functional programming with its insistence on immutability has been trying to win over hearts and minds for almost 50 years. Certainly in the last 10 years it has had a big uptick in popularity. However, it is an illusion, as both the Intel and ARM instruction sets have registers that mutate, and in fact there is nothing in the instruction set of either CPU architecture that makes immutability practical. The hardware is going to mutate, and the only way to create immutability is to use the \"mad hatter's tea party\" approach to memory. So there is going to be some resistance to immutability from the people who notice all the memory cache misses. Remember that it takes 100 clocks to get a piece of RAM that isn't in the cache. So you are going to pay dearly for immutability. It's a very interesting tension. Obviously they could change how CPU's work.",

Unlike Java which has a tendency to disperse state transition logic across different source code files, because each class might have some logic associated with it, my assertion is that when the state logic is collated into one central place it is far easier to understand it. One of the toughest parts of learning someone else's code is understanding what the states are, and what causes the machine to go from one state to another. In complex systems it can be extremely hard to figure out, especially looking at a static system. Usually you have to fire up the system and put in tracing to see how it behaves. Debugging incorrect transitions is one of the reasons why reversible systems hold such great promise.",

        "text": "I haven't read the paper yet but I think such efforts often come from the frustration that so much data is opaque to other programs. Databases have a shared set of primitive types and a limited set of combination semantics that can be shared across languages. If programs would use a serialization format that would be inter-operable on the units of work of the application it would be much easier to create rich interactions between applications.\n\nImagine for example that image formats instead of being binary blogs with exif style metadata sections that are xml encoded rdf embedded in binary, the entire object model would be persisted into a database - let's say sqlite. Let's say further that no files would exist in the OS and instead applications would have to add additional tables and entries in those tables to store their data. It would then be much easier to create queries that want to find image files that were created in a certain period, with a certain camera and lens. Or it would be easier to query for emails in your local email client because every message, contact etc would live in the shared database.\n\nUnix style OSs solved this issue by treating everything as a file but thus you loose a lot of structure and ability to discern data from metadata.\n\nThe real world problem that I would see with such a system is that this is only really powerful if different applications share types as much as possible, but in reality applications rarely share type definitions even on a superficial level even for the exact same concern. I think that great effort would have to be spent to try to avoid a proliferation of types that would in the end not make it much easier to deal with data because every app would represent it's data in different tables in the database and queries would have to accommodate all these different forms.\n\nWinFS was a Microsoft effort around the mid 2000s that for what I can tell went into this direction but was unfortunately abandoned. I wrote about this back in ... 2005: <http:\/\/danielbachler.de\/coding\/2005\/07\/03\/how-we-will-be-crushed-by-terrabytes-of-data.html> (I just noticed that these old articles didn't transition the markup correctly, sorry about the mess)",

For instance, that you should structure abstractions, or layers of your system, so that the things that are likely to be changed at the same time are easy to change at the same time, without needing to change any other things. Never really any explanation of how to do a good job of this. I've seen people say that composition via protocols (as opposed to class inheritance or interfaces) helps with this by allowing for better separation of concepts. The Clojure community is big on that. But again, nothing too formal. I believe the book Elements of Clojure by Zach Tellman (which is ostensibly more of a book of general principles than it is notions exclusive to Clojure) talks about this in more detail, but I haven't read it yet.",

They make an attempt to help you organize your web service into conceptually separate slices of domain logic (\"resources\"), and to organize each piece of each slice into a purpose-specific area of the codebase (model, view, migration, controller, services, script, stylesheet, etc). They also create homes for code that *must* be shared, for cross-cutting concerns (literally called \"concerns\" in Rails).\n\nSo when you're working on a particular problem, you can think of it in terms of \"I need to make a change that will affect just models\", or \"... a change that affects just the Users resource\" and clearly identify which parts of the code need to be changed, and which don't.\n\nOf course, this falls apart in the real world, because resources are often tightly interdependent and it's hard to draw clear boundaries.",

I don't think Rich Hickey's products represent the future of ease of use. Clojure is a LISP derivative, and that is not a user friendly language. Clojure and ClojureScript are incredibly productive, but they don't solve interchangeable parts or simplify the biggest time suck of programming, which is debugging. That's why there are so many people in this group, but we know it can be much improved. The whole regime of deciding if something should be immutable, and trying to recast things awkwardly so that is true, is extra work and complexity. i don't think the programmer should have to bother considering that; it is like worrying about which register the CPU uses; that decision is all automated now, and I don't know or don't care how many registers my CPU has.",

This system revolutionized French cannons, with a new production system that allowed lighter, more uniform guns without sacrificing range. The Gribeauval system superseded the Vallière system beginning in 1765. The new guns contributed to French military victories during the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars. The system included improvements to cannons, howitzers, and mortars. The Year XI system partly replaced the field guns in 1803 and the Valée system completely superseded the Gribeauval system in 1829.",

        "text": "Interchangeable parts were indeed pioneered by military suppliers. There is a famous anecdote about how the salesman showing president Abraham Lincoln how a gun could be assembled by picking a part from a series of tables, where the parts were pre-selected because the tolerances were not yet good enough to actually work. But the system was used to generate guns for the American Civil War, and it remains the most costly war in American history in terms of lives lost. Anyway interchangeable parts in software have been done a few times for selected ecosystems. Microsoft's VB6 was the high water mark in my opinion; they had a thriving marketplace of components for sale, and people were assembling products out of components that fit well together. To a smaller level of success but still a success the Borland Delphi system also has this going. They don't get any love from people as it is an old product, but it was well designed. If i am not mistake Anders Hejlsberg designed it, and he also designed TypeScript, so he is supremely accomplished tool developer.\n\nWe are definitely not in an era of interchangeable parts for software. If i have a project i am building and i peruse GitHub, i can search millions of repositories of code, yet I can't easily use any of it. There are too many framework and toolchain dependencies, and you either get a gigantic pile of dependencies, or it doesn't even work because things depend on conflicting versions of libraries. And the quality of the work is highly uncertain. You can't report a bug and be assured it will be fixed promptly because there is no incentive other than \"brownie points\" for keeping it up to date. You can't pay your mortgage with GitHub stars. And one cannot tell on these repositories how solid a piece of code is, and because of the tyranny of people who viciously attack any one daring to try and make a living directly and honestly from software, there is no marketplace for software components like the Apple iTunes app store or Google Play store. We really need a marketplace so people can be compensated for developing and maintaining components. For 3D models there are many marketplaces, like TurboSquid where you can pay a few dollars for a model of a ferrari that would take you 100 hours to build. A thriving business they have.\n\nIn this glorious future world, software will be more like Lego, with snap together pieces. Interestingly, there are some gigantic VC funded unicorns like Tableau which purports to offer interchangeable parts, but actually it is a bit of misdirection, as it is really just a collection of pre-made components all from one company, and it only works with their chassis. It is more like Excel with each special feature sold a-la-carte, which to me is more of a product marketing strategy than a technical breakthrough. You have to solve the dependency problem, the data interchange problem, and have a consistent drawing model for components to work harmoniously in a graphical interactive world. This is the tripartite challenge that makes it so difficult to achieve interchangeable parts. A gun is perhaps 30 pieces; compared to software a gun or a cannon is a very simple device. The whole motivation behind my Beads project is to create the possibility for interchangeable parts, which is why Beads includes a graph database, and a drawing\/event model, and an automatic dependency analyzer so pieces stay untangled. If you leave out any one of those 3 pieces, such as leaving the database outside the language, then people will choose a wide variety of databases, and then you can't mix part A with part B because one uses MySQL and the other Oracle. In toy systems like Scratch, they can achieve some interchangeability, but those kinds of systems have what i call a \"low ceiling\" where a product past a certain complexity level becomes burdensome, clumsy and clearly beyond the design vision of the original system.",

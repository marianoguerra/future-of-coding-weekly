        "text": "<@UCUSW7WVD> On your comment that \"Cathedral is way more loosely coupled than making a film.\" Okay, it can be, but surely it must be possible for software development collaboration to be as tightly coupled as making a film? And maybe some developers are using tightly coupled collaboration and getting benefit from it? I think that is worth exploring, if we are making a taxonomy of collaboration styles. What about pair programming?",

Other people (who you may not know) can discover your code, reuse it, remix it.\n\nCentralized version: github public repository.\nDecentralized version: IPFS, plus a discovery mechanism.\n\n2. Share your code with members of your team (but don't share it outside your team).\n\nCentralized: github private repository.\nLess centralized: Run your own git server, with authentication and a user account for each team member.\nDecentralized: Each team member has their own git repository, shares patches with other team members.\n\n3. Real time collaboration. Several people editing the same code base at the same time.\n\nCentralized: The true version of the code exists on a central server.\nDecentralized: Each person has their own copy of the code, and a peer to peer protocol keeps them in sync.\n\n4. Collaborative live coding. Several people editing the same code base while the program is running. Or, in a video\/music performance, outputs of one live coding session are taken as inputs to another live coding session, in real time.",

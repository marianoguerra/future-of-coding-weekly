        "text": "I guess the key things about the plan are that the infra makes it possible to just point to any part (resource-tree) of any other thing made by the infra (provided access is allowed), and use it in the code interchangeably from if it was within your code. (The client reading the infra will on the background automatically connect to and\/or cache the remote content.) This is then coupled with the attempt at reducing any app complexity and supporting a structure for a layered approach to app creation that would naturally consist of interoperable parts within the app itself. This is then extended by the (infra-level support for) not just using remote code, but  adapting it while maintaining the link.\n\nSo in the short-term vision this leads to me (as a overly simplified example) creating an app that rolls a d6 die with having a Dice element, and then you creating an app that directly uses my Dice element but I adjust the value \"6\" to \"10\", yet maintaining the link. So then when a third party looks at your code, it'll lead to mine as well, and perhaps they take it and make the number a parameter that can be provided...\n\nBut this leads to obvious issues about versioning and structural changes and authorship, and there's no inherent backward loop for improving my code (for easing further collaboration), etc. etc. etc. No silver bullet, this is a tough problem, but I have hopes something will develop out of this.\n\nThe grander vision would be to have an IDE\/software crafting environment which is built to support this sort of interaction, visualizes\/conceptualizes the connections between apps and makes them more social, and has some capabilities the bridge gaps between commercial and open source software.",

Doesn't matter what it's called, I think it's key to supporting this passive kind of collaboration\n\nHere's an unspoken thought in my head that's influenced  this line of thought: I normally see a strong correlation between people who are good with computers and those who like to work alone. I am one such person. I hate teamwork. I think this is partly because I am so augmented via a computer (which Engelbart designed to augment the single human) and much of that augmention disappears in a team setting, such as a spoken meeting, where I can't Google and precisely unpack assumptions and arguments and other pro tools. Thus teams are where I am weakest, so I avoid them. But that's also a huge weakness because teams are really powerful. What if computers were designed from the group up with the team usecase prioritized? I don't want to throw out the personal computers we have but maybe a new kind of interpersonal computer (maybe like Dynamicland) would be a great addition, and so I'm beginning to put my focus there",

In many current systems, it's either \"stay with flawed drafts\" (e.g. c++'s backwards compatibility) or \"refined abstractions that break everything\" (e.g. Python 2 \/ 3). I'm daydreaming of a system that is stable as it's first priority (think pinned dependencies) but allows to easily update (e.g. using code transformation tools). Rust's editions and `cargo fix` are interesting too (and have worked perfectly for me until now).\nProgram representations have a big impact on how effective code transformation \/ stability guarantees can be. So yeah, our \"text files in folders\" abstraction for representing programs might have to be changed first. I'm currently thinking of a graph-like \/ hash-based program representation. Using such a representation, transforming programs based on their semantics could be much easier and a lot of \"breaking changes\" (e.g. renaming a function, changing the order of parameters, ...) wouldn't be \"breaking\" anymore and therefore safe to perform frequently.",

        "text": "The interesting aspect here is how sharing happens. What are the artifacts you produce, how are they published, located, acquired, integrated etc?\n\nIn a shared-first approach this is built-in to the system. Like a persistent world multiplayer game, you create stuff in a shared virtual word that easily visible to others, and available for reuse and remixing. In an individual-first, this not a big concern because existing sharing methods may be deemed sufficient and are outside the system itself (copy files around, push to git etc.)\n\nI think the single shared world idea affects fundamental design decisions around composition methods. For instance, copying code files that need to be compiled into libraries does not seem the same as linking to a web page. The web is halfway there. It's a shared world where any published page has a URL and can be linked to. However the links are unstable and only jump links are available (no other forms of composition) and local development is outside the system. Projects like Unison and the Object Network are attempting to get there, it seems.  Both have the notion of a 'global id' to locate an element. Fluid is similar too, I think?\n\nAn earlier related idea from Joe Armstrong (Why do we need modules at all?) is `I am thinking more and more that if would be nice to have *all* functions in\na key_value database with unique names.`",

                "text": "Conway's law is an adage named after computer programmer Melvin Conway, who introduced the idea in 1967. It states that\n\norganizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.\n\nThe law is based on the reasoning that in order for a software module to function, multiple authors must communicate frequently with each other. Therefore, the software interface structure of a system will reflect the social boundaries of the organization(s) that produced it, across which communication is more difficult. Conway's law was intended as a valid sociological observation, although sometimes it's used in a humorous context. It was dubbed Conway's law by participants at the 1968 National Symposium on Modular Programming.",

        "text": "If a function in valos calls another function, say `foo.doSomething()` then what actually happens is that the resource `foo` is a valos Entity that has a Property `doSomething`, which references a valos resource containing the function data - this is likely to be a resource directly owned by foo, but it doesn't need to be, in fact it could be a resource on a completely different authority. When that function call starts to happen, the system running the valos (the valos _gateway_) will notice the reference to doSomething, discern from the partition URI the correct protocol for connecting to the authority that has that resource, establish the connection, fetch the contents, and then execute the function. The code doing the call (and indeed the user) doesn't need to care, and the actual Resource that the `foo.doSomething` references could indeed be called or renamed to whatever, the relevant part is that it's `a810b-c9eea-...` that lives at `<valos-protocol:\/\/authorityUri\/partition>`. In the programmer's IDE it will be just a reference like any other (well, probably with a small indicator that it's a foreign reference). (This has obvious app security ramifications, but those can be mitigated by various means.)",

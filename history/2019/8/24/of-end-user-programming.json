        "text": "<@UCUSW7WVD> I've worked in several software development environments where all the developers were on site in the same small team in the same office (no remoting), and where we had a \"one true source\" philosophy for the SCM system (no branches), and where accumulating changes for days or weeks at a time before checking in changes was discouraged. This required discipline and frequent communication between team members. Everybody had to know what everyone else was working on. At one place, we even had a scoreboard showing how long each team member had gone before checking in changes, to create peer pressure. I think this counts as a \"cathedral\" style. I think this style of work is far less common today, due to the effect of things like git and remote development on the culture. Today, I'm sure a lot of people can't comprehend how you'd develop a significant sized system without using branches. Just want to make it clear that this style of development has been practiced, and maybe still is in some places.",

        "text": "Hi <@UAVCC2X70>\n\nThis used to be called cooperative multitasking.  It was discredited in Windows 3.1, and then never(?) tried in an application setting (instead of in an O\/S setting).\n\nI believe that we need to get rid of the call-stack.  Esp. in a world where “everything is smart” and cpus are cheap.  The only (reasonable) way in which things can talk to each other is over a wire, not using a call-stack (for the comms\/IPC part).\n\nIn that kind of world, all software components must be designed to be concurrent.  [Hence, my interest in FBP.  I used to conflate “concurrency” with “parallelism” until I saw Rob Pike’s talk “Concurrency is not Parallelism (It’s Better)“.  (If you search for the talk, note that it has been renamed to drop the parenthsized bit)].\n\nIt is nearly trivial to implement cooperative multitasking using closures. A list of closures is randomly walked by a single routine - the Dispatcher.  The Dispatcher calls a closure.  Then, when the closure returns, the Dispatcher calls another closure.  The closures cannot (must not) directly call each other, they can communicate only by leaving events (short messages) in queues.  In this way, the call-stack only becomes 1 level deep.\n\nCooperative multitasking works in an application setting because, a bug - anywhere in the app - is - just a bug.  We don’t need MMUs to protect one subroutine from another inside an app.\n\nThis matches the FBP model and the thing I’m working on (incl. a set of rules to “structure” message passing).\n\nIf early OS developers didn’t have a disdain for Lisp and friends, they might have used closures instead of manually building closures in C and assembler (aka multiple stacks).",

One is obvious - an OS is under the control of the companies that make it. A third party cannot simply add a feature to Windows that allows two concurrent users with their own screens, mouse and keyboard, let alone a system where two users share the same screens; MS wouldn't want to redesign the OS to allow things like that because it might reduce their revenue (two users should buy two licenses!)\n\nMore subtly, I'm not a businessman, I'm a developer, and I have no interest in the business side of launching a startup. I have ideas that no businessperson could possibly have (extensibility and interoperability being technical problems), but without a business model and a business guy that can dream up a path to profitability and find investors, I can't implement my ideas. (UBI FTW?)\n\nMore broadly, while the business side is always a challenge, for a great many \"future of coding\" problems, it seems to me that the current world order is structurally against solving them (the incentives are missing, and we need those incentives to buy food). Which is not to say that the problems won't get solved, just that it will be a very slow, painful, annoying process that we will have to fight hard to be involved with.",

        "text": "I was interested to see how you measured success. I would like to have seen:\n- comparison against alternative courses\n- measurements other than student feedback\n\nI suspect a charming lecturer will score highly irrespective of the course content!\n\nI like the motivation but as someone from industry not academia, I would want you to go much further! It sounds like the assignments are all greenfield work. I'd like a PL design course to give students a 1M LOC dump of code and some rearchitecting goals. Can they understand the code and successfully refactor it?\n\nFrom a PL design point of view, it's the real test of a language and it's type system that I care about in practice and as an employer, it's the real-world skill I want students to learn.\n\nI am horrified by the waste we have in industry due to \"legacy code\" and rewrites which I fear is more about our difficulty to grok and maintain large code-bases than anything else.",

The point of this essay is moreso to discuss the curriculum than to make a sound claim about the outcomes.\n\n<@UFD2JRE58> it would be interesting to know what kind of refactoring tasks you consider most challenging. I’ve considered such assignments in the past, but I haven’t been able to find the right balance of challenging, meaningful, and doable in a week.",

I think I would collaborate with project maintainer to look over the history of a real codebase for a suitable bug\/feature that has been already been completed so you can assess the actual changes required.\n\nIt may not be a good assignment on an open source project if the answer is just sat there on GitHub! Might need to find an old deprecated project that isn't so accessible anymore. Anything on sourceforge lol.\n\nA better idea might be collaborating with a local company who has a suitable project. Good opportunity for the company to learn something too.",

But since I just keep pushing the date, I'll cut the crap and say hi: Hi :wave: Also I just started listening to <@U5TCAFTD3>'s podcast and it's been eerie (and fulfilling) to hear so similar thoughts.\nMy thinking for the last few years has been around more incremental improvements to the programming status quo. ~2 years ago I built a JSON editor that doesn't let you syntax error (<https:\/\/gregoor.github.io\/syntactor>). It was supposed to be a full JS editor, but I drowned in TODOS. I talked about the project at the Salon des Refuses of that year (and met <@UEJDZRQB1>, nice to see you here :slightly_smiling_face: ).\nI've restarted the project a couple of months ago and I'm close to having it in a state worth showing. It's not super out there (you're still \"just writing\" JavaScript) but I think it's a step out of the text-manipulation stone age we currently live in.\nIn my day job I work as the lead developer on Mozilla's Common Voice (<https:\/\/voice.mozilla.org\/en>). Leave your voice if you want to contribute to an open data set :upside_down_face: I live in Berlin, so if you're around ping me, and I'll show you some great vietnamese restaurant. :ramen:",

Eve seems to have made strides in one possible direction in that area.\nGiven people's familiarity with Excel, table columns and rows should be a relatively simple sell.\nFor your example, you could also write it as:\n```\nclass People {\n\tstring[] phoneNumbers;\n\tstring[] names;\n\tstring[] addresses;\n}\n```\nwhich is not too dissimilar from your original layout. If you squint a bit, you can see the members as the column headers of a table called People...",

I'm thinking having users write SPMD programs by default, take away their ability to iterate over collections and treat all code as kernels that operate on smallish heterogenous arrays of data (the language can convert everything to SoA if necessary). pixel and vertex shaders do that already (especially material editors in AAA game engines), so do visual particle system (unity vfx and niagra) and machine learning\\scientific computing frameworks kind of do it.   All of these environments are heavily constrained, and its still possible to make things that perform horribly, or perform well in isolation and poorly in production.  I think its possible to build a pretty robust simulation framework\\game engine type thing that encourages high performance, even if its constrained in certain ways",

The primary difficulty is caused by the 1 out of 500 or 1 out of 1000 word errors that are inevitably in the code. This tiny percentage of the total number of words represents the majority - if not 85% by some peoples' estimates - of the total effort of the project. So it is the flies in the ointment that are the hard part. If people could type in their programs, run it a few times to shake down the rough spots, and be done, it would be a fun occupation and hobby. These errors in the code are not caused by the computer but by the inhuman level of perfection that one must rise to, to match the computer. We need a more protective and assistive toolset. Error is the enemy to be conquered. My mentor at JPL, Prentiss Knowlton, wrote out his programs in longhand, and after bench checking them, put them on to punch cards and ran the program. For him, Fortran was like prose.",

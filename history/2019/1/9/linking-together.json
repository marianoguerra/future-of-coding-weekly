        "text": "I loved the fact that my 8-year-old son was able to jump right in into designing his own game with Pico-8 in the sprite editor. And the sound editor was also easy to learn. So maybe one thing to learn from it is that if a platform offers solid design tools, then that will motivate learning the programming part too? Maybe one of the reasons for success of Flash, HyperCard, Director etc. And the web too — you can start by designing and worry about the code later.\n\nThen again, this creates an artificial barrier between coding and designing, which is not something that I feel to be ideal.",

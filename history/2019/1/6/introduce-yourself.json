        "text": "It isn't hard to prove that JavaScript is about 99% a perfect copy of AS2, because you can write a program in AS3, run it through a type-stripper find'replace script and voila you have a JavaScript program. Nowadays with the ES2015 and later additions to JS they have crept towards AS3 which although it has types so it is more like JS of the future does show the shameless copying that the JS team has done of the AS language. I just converted 25,000 lines of code the other day from AS3 to JS. You can tell it is a copy because of the strange quirks in AS which were copied verbatim. For example, when you ask the date functions for the month of their in AS2\/3 it returns the month based on 0, but the day based on 1. The JS date functions do this identically. And the Math... library is almost identical. When you have worked with converting AS3 code (originating from Adobe's Flash Builder, you can see how close they really are. They can't admit they copied it for legal reasons, so the myth that magically a fully formed syntax emerged in a mere 2 weeks persists. Larry Ellison once he bought Sun spent serious money suing Google over how Java was used, and to avoid another incident like that nobody wants to bring up the subject. Frankly Adobe is a much nicer company than Sun, and  I doubt they would ever be so litigious as Oracle is. What annoys me is how poorly they have copied the AS3 features like Modules; the ES Module system is deeply flawed because the implementors have misread the specification on modules, and if you have a module like Math, and import all the symbols, using import * from Math, and refer to a function in Math that doesn't exist, the compiler doesn't catch it. Oops! that is pretty dumb. The current JS compilers think of a module name as an object with an undefined property.  Once again people have neglected to study Prof. Wirth's brilliant work with Modula-2.",

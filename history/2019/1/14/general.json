When there's a specific domain, it's easier to think of ways to make tasks in that domain easier.\n\n\"the allure of programming language research, that the tools and theories we develop don’t affect just a single domain, but potentially everybody who programs\"\n\nIf domain-specific languages were more composable, maybe work can be done to gradually make each domain easier while still allowing a general purpose program to be constructed from those parts?",

I think he makes a good argument for why we should use graphs to represent programs. Are you aware of any work to standardize on such a graph format? <@UD4Q9LT52> presented one at one of the Strangeloop 2018 meetups that runs with this idea. He decided to use labeled edges so that things like type graphs and data dependencies can be represented in the same graph structure.",

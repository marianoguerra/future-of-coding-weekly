        "text": "Based on my work experience as a UX designer, I feel that there is very strong split between different types users on whether they prefer coding or not.\n\nSome people have very strong wish to be able to type raw code (SQL, DSL, Lua, etc) and get frustrated with UI-based tools. If there is an option to either use UI or code, they always check the code first.\n\nWhile others are scared of typing even a single line of code but can do very complex (possibly even Turing-complete!) configurations using a UI. But if something they perceive as coding is required, they ask somebody else to help.\n\nThis is definitely something to take into account when building a tool. The UI should be based on the types of users you have for the tool.",

One thing that I am trying to figure out if there is are use cases that are hard to code or feel repetitive even with code but can be visualized or built much better using a UI. A question for us is whether there are some things that programmers feel are inherently hard to put together in the context of API driven workflows",

        "text": "hi team!\nI've been following <@U5TCAFTD3> for a while.. and now is the time to join.\n\nMy thesis and my team's is that everyone should have access to general purpose computation, so that they can unlock data and processes that only they can customize. Our approach is to package the basic ingredients (logic, I\/O, clocks, persistence and \"databases\") into the functions of the cells of a spreadsheet. Like lego.\n\nMy initial thinking on the matter started a few years back (<https:\/\/www.patife.com\/entries\/9\/>).\nWe're launching in a couple of weeks at <http:\/\/dashdash.com|dashdash.com>. we're a 2-year old startup where i'm a product owner and CEO in a great team of 24.\n\nso far we have built\n- the regular excel functions like vlookup(), min(), max(), etc (same names, syntax, types and coercion)\n- new: web functions like get(), post(), and integrations that give you send_sms() and more\n- new: automation with repeat(  , period)\n- new: side effects with insert() and update() for table-to-table operations.\nYou can find a video of an example of what we do here <https:\/\/twitter.com\/patife\/status\/1086345026643394560>\n\nI hope to get feedback on our product and explore how to _translate_ programming for non-techies, which functions to build, and how to avoid people taping into dangerous resources. you can follow me at <https:\/\/twitter.com\/patife\/>",

        "text": "Hi, I'm Duncan,\n\nI'm building <https:\/\/thorny.io>, an interactive notebook for decision making.\nI want to help engineers tackle overwhelming design, planning and strategy problems where multiple decisions are tangled together.\n\nThe end goal is not a programming tool but it is still an end-user computation problem because at their most general level, decisions, plans and reasoning, are actually types of computation.\n\nThe underlying structure is a knowledge graph which includes possibilities and reasoning (similar to syntax tree).\nLike a spreadsheet, if you change the reasoning, decisions or beliefs, then the consequences ripple through the graph.\nThe UI I have been exploring is\n- an outliner (effectively a structure editor for a reasoning notation)\n- with spreadsheet power (it supports formulas that reference other parts of the knowledge graph)\nThe demos on the site are out of date and baffling, I will update them with the current version shortly!\n\nI am based in Bristol UK. I studied CompSci at Cambridge and was previously head of software at an engineering firm building various design and optimization tools for engineers. I am interested in the typical Brett Victor topics plus:\n- non-monotonic reasoning\n- belief networks\n- logic programming\n- argument mapping\n- optimization and solvers\n\nI have also built various compilers, code generation and visualization tools.\nI want to work more in the open and share more but I find it tough.\nI am so impressed with <@U5TCAFTD3> and this community, I have so much to learn here!",

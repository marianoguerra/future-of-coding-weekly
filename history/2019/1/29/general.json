        "text": "I agree if the student is motivated they'll learn it. But take for example assembly language. How many programmers have written any? I feel like most programmers start with a high level language and may never actually get down to assembly language. There are tens of thousands of LAMP stack programmers or rails programmers or django programmers or Java\/C#\/Kotlin\/Swift programmers that just use the libraries given. I think that's fine. Those people are super productive. A taxi driver doesn't need to know how to fix cars and a Rails programmer doesn't need assembly.\n\nI feel like games and 3D is going the same direction. More often than not a student can download Unity\/Unreal, put some characters in. They don't have to do collision math the system provides it. They don't have to do any math to make one character target another the system provides a solution. They don't have to do path finding that's provided. Give a character a destination and the system will move them to it avoiding obstacles. They don't have to do physics, it's also provided as well.\n\nI'm not sure what my point is, except that maybe in some way trying to teach how to draw 3D graphics or do physics with code is like trying to teach people how to knit cloth. It's nice to know but no longer a useful skill since machines spit out textiles for us now and similarly 3d engines and game engines handle all the math.\n\nIn any case I'm not trying to discourage anyone from learning 3D and I've written a bunch of articles teaching it. I'm just mostly wondering out loud if those skills are becoming more like learning to knit cloth or learning to grind a lens whereas the world has moved on to using machine made textiles and buying cameras.\n\nI still think students, especially younger ones could find writing their own 3D renderer and learning the math involved super interesting.",

I’m struggling a bit with motivation.\n\nSpecifically, getting psyched and motivated enough to consistently work on self-study every evening after work or on weekends (pretty much the only free time I have). I feel tired out at those times and need to somehow get myself to focus, even if just for a short time.\n\nCan anyone recommend a place I might find a motivation buddy? Like someone who also wants to put in consistent effort towards a goal, so we can remind and motivate each other? Maybe one of you are in a similar place and would like to pair up?\n\nOr also, any apps, etc that might help? Or even a simple motivation technique?\n\nThanks ahead of time for any help you can offer!",

I’ve been able to implement successful exercise and reading habits last year with the help of small apps like Seven (<http:\/\/7minworkoutapp.net\/>) and Streaks (<https:\/\/streaks.app\/>). Honestly, the apps just help a tiny little bit, and the main point is you need to somehow manage to install those activities in your day, ideally attaching them to something you already do every day (like brushing your teeth or taking a shower). \n\n+1 for Atomic Habits. Haven’t read the book, but I’ve been reading the author’s blog for a while.\n\nI’d love to see more happening here in this forum where we support each other with our projects or our output. Something like the <#CCL5VVBAN|feedback> channel is in that spirit, but I’m sure there’s more we could do.\n\nWhen I was at the Recurse Center (<http:\/\/recurse.com|recurse.com>) we did daily check-ins. That’s basically like a Scrum stand-up where everybody present just gives a quick overview of what they did yesterday, will do today, and challenges they could use help with or would like to pair(-program) on. That often surfaced helpful advice and spontaneous study groups and helped keep motivation levels up.\nMaybe there’s a similar format that works virtually and across time zones?\n\nI’m in London, UK and also happy to experiment locally, if anybody wants to meet.",

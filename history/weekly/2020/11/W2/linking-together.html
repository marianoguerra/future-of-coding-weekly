Excel embeds images as well. On a team I was on they used google sheets for bug tracking and pasted screenshots into cells. I'm not saying that was a good experience given there was no way to easily filter which bugs are fixed or who is looking into them plus loading a sheet with 500 screenshots is slow. But didn't see anything in the tool above that suggested it would do any better at these problems.</p>
<p>i'm not trying to put down custom tools, only from the video it looked like all they got from is particular one was an extremely tedious way of making basically a spreadsheet but minus 90% of the features, many of which are useful.</p>

We will also cover tools and techniques that help us build user-friendly programming systems—e.g., program synthesis, structure editors, abstraction design, program slicing.</p>

I’m toying with the idea of collaborating towards a series of artworks that manifest and demonstrate Alexander’s 15 geometric properties of wholeness in the digital space and which could later on perhaps serve as material for a practical studio course that teaches these properties in a way more accessible to computer people so that they don’t have to become architects first to learn them.</p>
<p>I tweeted a little thread about this as a beacon for interested people to find me and to start a discussion (and perhaps even collaboration?).</p>
<p>Would greatly appreciate if you helped spread the word to people you know who might be interested. 🙏</p>

Please do (tag me). Not sure how much time you want to spend reading Alexander, but book 1 of Nature of Order is about harmonious configuration of centers, which is extremely geometric (Alexander is a trained mathematician). I am just about to finish book 1 and couldn’t help but think of your work several times. I’d really love to hear your take on it…</p>

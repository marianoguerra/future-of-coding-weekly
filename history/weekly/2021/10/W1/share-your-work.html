<p>I am working on an interactive programming language named Flourish,  which aims to be programmable only in run time. The only available programming style being exploratory programming, I believe it implicitly forces TDD.  Even the concept of dependency injection is somewhat inclusive of language design.</p>

<p>Yes. It won't show the results. The highlighted portion of the stale result corresponding to a previous state  (when the condition was evaluated to false).</p>
<p>On a separate note, in the above screenshot, you cant change lines 10-11(grayed out)  as long as the condition at line 9 is false! You can only edit executing pieces of code. This design decision was taken to prevent ANY mental simulation while coding.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Bold and intriguing idea - can't modify dead code - I kinda like it. I'm usually very strongly in favor of avoiding mental simulation, but even I'm not sure if this goes too far 😂 I can see how this enforces TDD.</p>
<p>What if you call the same function twice? Which of the two values will be displayed?</p>
<p>Your mention of dependency injection reminded me of the Newspeak language - have you looked at that?</p>

Have to say, growth hackers use ‘devs’ (shortening of ‘software developers’) word with same ironic connotations more often than not 🙂</p>
<p>So I have this 4-hours trainings, pretentiously named <code>how to tell a story via web medium</code>, prepared that I run for development+marketing teams being brought together in the same room. It is at the same time attempt to introduce <code>ubiquitous language</code> (in domain-driven-design (DDD) context) for daily communication in marketing+development teams cooperation.</p>
<p>In an attempt to de-mystify some common myths of what <code>growth hackers(marketing communication specialists)</code> actually do and how <code>developers/admins/devopsers/u-name-it</code> could help them do their work better (or at least stop creating huge roadblocks, such as instroducing react&amp;friends in acquisition funnel websites, to give an example) - I would like to propose to an online webinar for FoC community those above mentioned <code>how to tell a story via web medium</code> trainings (free of charge) .</p>
<p>Please put ➕ if you’d be interested in joining this webinar. In case at least 4-5 people would express interest, we could start arrange’ing date&amp;time in a thread, including any special topics you’d like to be addressed and included for me to prepare on top of current content.</p>

So that’s where my grumpiness about “growth hacking” in particular comes from.

<p>Also agree that the term <code>growth hacking</code> is very commonly misused. Yet it is very successfully coined term in a sense how real world activities correlate to semantic meaning of the term, I should say. Comparably, way bigger problem is with <code>content marketing</code> term. I was once strongly considering to attend a nationwide <code>content marketing</code> conference with a speech deck named ‘can you kindly explain me which marketing communications activities are considered not content marketing?’, but decided not to be a party pooper 🙂</p>

Let’s make this happen! 🙂 Am thinking, maybe i’d try to squeeze the content into 1.5 hours (sharing key statements before the call here), and them maybe 1.5 hours for Q&amp;A/discussion. 3 hours is a lot of time to book, so if some of you could only make two hours, than we’d prioritise the questions of those who’d have to leave earlier, and we’d share the summary of rest q&amp;a/discussion later here in slack. So, min 2 - max 3 hours. But to start with, let’s pick a date. I’m offering the week after next - kindly please which day(s) seem to suite enough to fit 2 hours in the calendar: <a href="https://doodle.com/poll/a9af7dewvzbpcf4r"></a><a href="https://doodle.com/poll/a9af7dewvzbpcf4r">https://doodle.com/poll/a9af7dewvzbpcf4r</a> . After we’d pick date, we can proceed to time selection. If this week completely does not work for any of you, we can move the week to one later. Looking forward and thanks again!</p>

For developers - <code>jamstack</code> is a term describing backend architecture - how should the server respond to request - by loading html from disk/cache and serving it statically VS dynamically rendering html response. But in 9/10 cases devs identify it as a ‘trendy’ way to build frontend. The ultimate problem is that there is a void in frontend architectures naming. Or - a mess in frontend architectures naming.

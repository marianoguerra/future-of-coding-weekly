<p>There's something to be said for letting ideas "marinade"... I was working on an outline today and that got me thinking about the Layered Text prototype I built almost 3 years ago (link in the :thread:). With a little encouragement from @niveor, I decided to give it a go:</p>

<p>I am working on a visual programming system to allow for combining multiple visual programming paradigms and not just flow-based-progamming. Finally I've made enough progress to my project to make a small video of it again: <a href="https://youtu.be/mIfs9Axqeic">youtu.be/mIfs9Axqeic</a>. </p>
<p>In the video you see a very simple statechart for a traffic light including the visualisation and other needed logic (it also has timers, gates, splitters, a html-node with support for expression-script and a bit more). The traffic light also shows a countdown when the light is red and will countdown to 0 and show a green light again.. all still very simple offcourse.</p>
<p>In the video you can see that the running of the flow is also being shown by those animated elements which move through the flow... since I want to prevent "spaghetti", I've created some node-types that allow for triggering other nodes without having a physical connection. Currently it's not clearly visible (except by text) which nodes are invisibly connected to what node, but I have some ideas on how to improve that. But that's for another video.</p>
<p>The upcoming months I want to focus on improving the UI, interaction and fix bugs to be able to put this online somewhere so it can be tried out and I hopefully can collect some feedback.  </p>
<p>Greetings, Maikel</p>

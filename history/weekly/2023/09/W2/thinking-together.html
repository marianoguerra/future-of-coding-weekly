I recently noticed how I struggle regrouping things by topic/task/project on my different devices (laptop, phone). Quite frequently, one topic can be spread across 5+ apps/website. My less than ideal solution is to introduce another aggregator app (roam research in my case) and paste &amp; tags different links when possible. Arc browser spaces also helps with that. The issue is that it's very manual and not worth for small ad hoc topic and researches.</p>
<p>Is this a problem you are facing? How do you solve/work-around it? Any interesting links on the topic?</p>
<p>I believe it could &amp; should be solved at the OS level and found really interesting project: <a href="https://playb.it/">playb.it</a>, MercuryOS, <a href="https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/000/">alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/000</a> but I feel like there should be more</p>

<p>Do you think "convivial" in the Illich sense has connotations of communality? Like, having a strong sense of membership in a coherent, shared community?</p>
<p>I'd never really thought of it that way, but I was just chatting with a friend who's only skimmed the essay, and had that impression. Obviously I think I'm right, but I also wonder if I've been reading my own bias towards independence and self-sufficiency into the essay. I'd appreciate thoughts. "The future is a disagreement with the past about what is important." And at this point it doesn't matter what Illich intended, only what we in the audience tend to make of his words.</p>
<p>If we tend to agree that conviviality is independent of social arrangements, and that it is equally applicable to gregarious people who like to be cheek by jowl with others and introverts who are more off on their own, this might suggest that the word "conviviality" isn't an ideal term in the year 2023 for a value a lot of us tend to aim towards here. It was a frontrunner in our long thread about renaming FoC (<a href="https://linen.futureofcoding.org/t/42821/here-s-a-big-one-apologies-in-advance-to-everyone-for-the-un">linen.futureofcoding.org/t/42821/here-s-a-big-one-apologies-in-advance-to-everyone-for-the-un</a>) but perhaps it has some distracting connotations.</p>

<p>Outside of the context of Illich's book, this connotation is much stringer. See e.g. Merriam-Webster's definition of "convivial":</p>
<blockquote><p>relating to, occupied with, or fond of feasting, drinking, and good company</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I first read the book, my immediate reaction was "he uses "convivial" in a weird sense". By now I am used to it, and use it myself in that way, but there is a constant risk of being misunderstood.</p>

Also read some LM Sacasas and Ursula Franklin on this or similar topics. And with regards to your question of "Do you think "convivial" in the Illich sense has connotations of communality? Like, having a strong sense of membership in a coherent, shared community?" I'll have to say: yes, absolutely in my opinion. And I'm having a hard time seeing how it could be different to be honest. Could you maybe go into a bit more detail about how you interpret the term?</p>
<p>Also, I'm not seeing how introverts wouldn't fit into this. e.g. I'm highly introverted but couldn't exist or flourish in any way without a community‚Äìin my view, no human really can.</p>

Practicing conscious creating of culture (group behaviour) is a difficult thing as the observation also changes behaviour again...</p>
<p>Its a bit like quantum physics in that sense.</p>
<p>Buts its so interesting to see you come into this place where you start questionting the  <em>meaning</em>  of words  used by people. HAHA</p>
<p>I'm sometimes also there. Its a related territory to the place where alan kay referenced martin luther as a great interface designer because of the "invention" of a common german language.</p>
<p>I think its a good thing to be in doubt or at least aware of the implications of using terms that lead to misunderstanding.</p>

I'm starting to realize there's a thorny pre-problem in this discussion of even separating two ideas in my mind using the imprecise tool of language. Or at least my imperfect wielding of language.</p>
<p>As I continue to poke at this, it seems worth leaving this quote from <a href="http://akkartik.name/illich.pdf">akkartik.name/illich.pdf</a> (italicization identical to original):</p>
<blockquote><p>After many doubts, and against the advice of friends whom I respect, 
 <em>I have chosen "convivial" as a technical term to designate a modern society of responsibly limited tools.</em> 
 In part this choice was conditioned by the desire to continue a discourse which had started with its Spanish cognate. The French cognate has been given technical meaning (for the kitchen) by Brillat‚àíSavarin in his 
 <em>Physiology of Taste: Meditations on Transcendental Gastronomy</em> 
. This specialized use of the term in French might explain why it has already proven effective in the unmistakably different and equally specialized context in which it will appear in this essay. I am aware that in English "convivial" now seeks the company of tipsy jollyness, which is distinct from that indicated by the OED and opposite to the austere meaning of modern 
 <em>"eutrapelia,"</em> 
 which I intend. By applying the term "convivial" to tools rather than to people, I hope to forestall confusion.</p>

<p>Since its beginnings in the 1940s, automated reasoning by computers has become a tool of ever growing importance in scientific research. So far, the rules underlying automated reasoning have mainly been formulated by humans, in the form of program source code. Rules derived from large amounts of data, via machine learning techniques, are a complementary approach currently under intense development. The question of why we should trust these systems, and the results obtained with their help, has been discussed by philosophers of science but has so far received little attention by practitioners. The present work focuses on independent reviewing, an important source of trust in science, and identifies the characteristics of automated reasoning systems that affect their reviewability. It also discusses possible steps towards increasing reviewability and trustworthiness via a combination of technical and social measures.</p>

If you want to share files on a regular basis, Syncthing (<a href="https://syncthing.net/">syncthing.net</a>) is a good choice. I use it for sharing data across devices (Linux, macOS, Android) and with family members. Its unit of data is a shared directory, which is identified by a UUID. Anyone who has the UUID can access the shared data (by default, you can configure more restrictive rules). Data exchange is P2P, but machines find each other (again, by default) via a public relay. With the standard configuration, you create a directory, add it to Syncthing, and then send the UUID to the people who you want to share with.</p>

<p>I was glad to hear our hosts were on a similar thought-track when discussing the "send this draft to the rest of the group and let me know when they've read it" example regarding how programmers tend to parse the last bit as "let me know when the metrics indicate they scrolled to the end" (etc) whereas a human agent would parse it as "and follow up with them after a reasonable time to ask if they've read it or not."</p>
<p>One thing that struck me was the number of times I've told a white lie in that kind of scenario. Yes, I read it! (No, I haven't, but I just pulled it up when you asked and I'm skimming it now before the meeting starts).</p>
<p>Dishonesty with the metrics-mindset takes a different form. In simple forms, it's like terms of service pages which gate the "agree" button behind a scroll value... You scroll to the end to lie. But if the designers of those metrics were somehow able to perfect them (eye tracking? a quiz at the end?) then an AI agent could force a more accurate/truthful answer from you.</p>
<p>All that to get to my point... Do we have a right to lie about this stuff? How important is it for us to be able to present less-than-truthful representations to other people even if the medium is via an AI agent? If we don't include this concern in our designs, are we facilitating a world of micro-surveillance of coworkers and friends?</p>

<p>An app that automatically sends read receipts is often wrong about whether I‚Äôve read something.  ~<em><em>That‚Äôs</em></em>~  a lie. If my AI is going to lie, I‚Äôd rather it be on my behalf. I don‚Äôt think I can even consider it my AI unless its lies are in my interest.</p>

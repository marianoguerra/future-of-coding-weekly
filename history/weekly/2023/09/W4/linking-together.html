For example, ZIO Test <a href="https://zio.dev/reference/test/assertions/smart-assertions">zio.dev/reference/test/assertions/smart-assertions</a> does something to rewrite assertions "smartly" so that you don't have to use a bunch of "assert*" variants.  The also mention the Verse programming language, which seems to be playing with very flexible concurrency and non-determinacy constructs.  For example, instead of carefully deciding whether to enable/disable buttons in a UI as state changes, you could say, "disable a button if pressing it would fail for any reason."</p>

<p>The smart assertion is a simple way to assert both ordinary values and ZIO effects. It uses the assertTrue function, which uses macro under the hood.</p>

<blockquote><p> Macs have brought a great deal to us over the years: desktop publishing, design, image editing and processing, multimedia, and more. One of the few fields where they have failed is programming, despite many attempts. Here I look back at some of those opportunities we missed</p>

<p>Products seem to be made for users, but I think this might be an illusion; they are more like a medium for self-expression.
Different expressions, conceived by various minds, undergo a form of natural selection, with the surviving expression being the one that resonates most with users.
I mean, the process unfolds like this: you create something not because “I think they might need this,” but because “I find this so fucking interesting.</p>

So <a href="https://ashleyblewer.com/">Ashley Blewer</a> has created this <a href="https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/halt-and-catch-fire-syllabus/">wonderful syllabus</a> to go along with the TV show "Halt and Catch Fire" (2014-2017), "a fictional narrative about people working in tech during the 1980s-1990s." The syllabus features readings on the history of technology, computers, programming etc. as well as recommended RFCs and emulators of old systems to take a look at to provide material for discussions about a set of episodes.</p>
<p>I wanted to watch the show for a long time now, and since I really enjoy the A Pattern Language book club that was linked to here a few months ago, I thought it might be a nice idea to create a watch club to go through the series together–the way Ashley intended!</p>
<p>I created a Discord for this purpose. Right now, no date has been set for the first session, as I want to give people some time to show up first. I'll announce the schedule soon. If all this sounds like something you might be interested in, please join me in this adventure!</p>
<p>Here's the link: <a href="https://discord.gg/T3BDJN6AXz">discord.gg/T3BDJN6AXz</a></p>

<p>Not asking/expecting you to change now, and certainly understand how it's often the easiest choice to get set up... but I also feel it's worth reminding people that in going that route they're making privacy decisions for their users that may not be in their interests. That's true for closed commercial platforms of all stripes, but doubly so when it's a company with a specific history of abusing their users' trust.</p>

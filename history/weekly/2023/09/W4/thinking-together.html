The first thing that I think of when I hear this is “whiteboards”.  What are the dimensions involved in whiteboards? x/y/t.  T goes forwards (e.g. adding new details by drawing them in over time) and backwards (erasing parts of drawings).  Iteration. Scrubbing.</p>

The secret is: be very explicit and make everything very explicit as you think.  Then, you can always wrap syntactic skins over the stuff, in order  to elide the concepts that you think should be elided.  In my mind, you can’t know what to elide if you don’t know - explicitly - what you’re dealing with.  I guess that this is a kind of Physicist perspective - I want to know what makes things tick, I want to know what the Atoms are.  Synthesizing better UXs is easier when you begin with a bag filled with Atoms.</p>

You can't take a state, and the program, and then  move it one step backwards and expect to get the previous state, because the languages don't have a semantics in that direction in time. So time-travel mode would require a gazillion save files that you could reload whenever you like. And the size of the programs grows to match the available space, so programs run on many-gigabyte machines would need many-terrabyte machines to be able to record that kind of history.</p>

So... how about a framework that lets developers add context-specific time-travelling debugging to their code, as a form of instrumentation?</p>
<p>I have done this in Pharo Smalltalk (copying the practice of others, I didn't invent anything in this space), using the <a href="https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo-beacon">Beacon</a> library. It implements an in-memory logging system, which in an image-based language is usually all you need in terms of logging. You can add arbitrary Smalltalk objects to your log. Including stackframes. Which you can inspect in a debugger later on (or process with your own code if that's more convenient).</p>
<p>This isn't quite the same as time-travel because the Smalltalk image consists of mutable objects, to which stack frames only hold references. So if you have global mutable state, you have to add snapshots of it to the log as well, and then it gets messy. If you are careful with globale and/or long-lived mutable state in your overall design, which is good advice in Smalltalk anyway, it's rarely an issue in practice.</p>

<p>Quoting Christopher Alexander ("The timeless way of building"):</p>
<blockquote><p>So long as I build for myself, the patterns I use will be simple, and human, and full of feeling, because I understand my situation. But as soon as a few people begin to build for "the many,"  their patterns about what is needed become abstract; no matter how well-meaning they are, their ideas gradually get out of touch with reality, because they are not faced daily with the living examples of what the patterns say.</p>

New here, but latest episode of Future of Coding (‘ <em>66 - a Small Matter of Programming</em> ’) made me think of something closely related.</p>
<p>Part of the discussion was about using formal vs informal language to communicate with a computer, and whether ‘end-user programming’ would be feasible using those methods or not.</p>
<p>One tool which came to mind is ‘<a href="https://ganelson.github.io/inform-website/">Inform</a>’. It is a tool (mainly a programming language, though it also ships with its own IDE-like thing) to write text adventure games.</p>
<p>But rather than being geared towards  <em>programmers</em> , it is geared towards  <em>writers.</em> </p>
<p>An example of a simple program:</p>
<pre><code>The Cabin is a room.  "The front of the small cabin is entirely occupied with navigational instruments, a radar display, and radios for calling back to shore. Along each side runs a bench with faded blue vinyl cushions, which can be lifted to reveal the storage space underneath. A glass case against the wall contains several fishing rods.



Scratched windows offer a view of the surrounding bay, and there is a door south to the deck. A sign taped to one wall announces the menu of tours offered by the Yakutat Charter Boat Company."



The Cabin contains a glass case. In the glass case is a collection of fishing rods.



The case is closed, transparent, and openable.



The bench is in the cabin. On the bench are some blue vinyl cushions.



The bench is enterable.



The Beach is a room. "A beautiful beach where the sunset can be seen. Some seagulls are flying overhead."

The Beach is south of the Cabin.</code></pre><p>Some points for consideration are:</p>
<ul><li>Where do you think a language like Inform fall on the ‘formal’ vs ‘informal’ spectrum?</li><li>Inform is perhaps the most widely used tool to create text adventures with today.

<blockquote><p>Where do you think a language like Inform fall on the ‘formal’ vs ‘informal’ spectrum?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Preliminary question; what exactly changes from one end to the other of that spectrum? My current answer is: how much of the total information conveyed is formal. I'd love to hear from others who have thought about this question, or know about work on this topic in the literature.</p>
<p>To illustrate my definition, a few examples:</p>
<ul><li>Machine code is near 100% formal.</li><li>Standard programming languages are mostly formal, the informal part being the variable names, which convey context-dependent information to humans but nothing to the compiler/interpreter.</li><li>Markup languages (HTML, Markdown, ...) are mostly informal, because the formalized information is not the most relevant part. You could strip it away and the rest would still fulfill its purpose.</li></ul><p>There are lots of subtleties I am glossing over. Example: A Python program saying  <code>print("...")</code>  with a 100 KB string is basically just decorated informal prose. My definition applies to typical or intended use, not possible extremes.</p>
<p>Back to Inform: I cannot judge from the example which information is extracted from the code by formal processing. Is this a controlled natural language, like <a href="http://attempto.ifi.uzh.ch/site/">Attempto</a> ? Or plain English from which some engine extracts isolated keywords?</p>

<p>The task of developing programming languages boils down to figuring out how to map (1) to (2).</p>
<p>I think that the best language for (2) machine readability is Lisp syntax (not necessarily Lisp semantics, which is a different issue).  I think that the best language for (1) human readability is a hybrid of box-and-arrow diagrams mixed with text.  Currently, I am writing programs in <a href="http://draw.io">draw.io</a> and compiling them to executable Odin code (thanks to Zac Nowicki).  I am using this, also, as a visual shell (VSH) to plumb together Ohm-JS and ‘.RWR’ (“rewrite” nano-DSL) specifications to form transpilers (e.g. Scheme-&gt;JS).</p>
<p>I firmly believe in what I learned in Physics - invent multiple notations suited to expressing the task(s) using “simplifying assumptions” and bolt them all together to form solutions using divide-and-conquer mentality.</p>

You can read them like English sentences but if you try to write them that way you probably will get a connective wrong or some other subtle thing and it won't parse or won't communicate with something else.</p>
<p>More generally I think it's easy to conflate readability and writeability, they're obviously related but still quite different properties.</p>
<p>Actually for a lot of things writeability is far more important than readability. E.g. when live-coding music you don't necessarily have to read/understand exactly what code is doing because you can understand the code by experiencing the results while writing, rather than reading the code.</p>

<ul><li>Jimmy mentioned writing browser extensions. Just recently, there was a thread (probably on HN), with discussion of people sharing filter snippets for uBlock Origin. It turns out that besides simply filtering links and so on, the snippets are also being used to modify styles and visibility for all sorts of things that people find needing change on various web sites. This, along with the whole "view source" era discussion, suggests that it hasn't gone away. Browser extensions such as uBlock Origin also include a colour-style picker for identifying the elements on the page that you're interested in. So in a way, it is very much enabling a simple sort of end-user programming, right in the browser. You won't see the back-end, but can manipulate the DOM that is very much on the client.</li><li>Regarding the discussion in the episode on early education, teaching kids programming, I was thinking along the lines of teaching the means to observe. "View source" is one such part, along with browser dev-tools. Perhaps most people won't be interested in modifying the programs they use, but teaching the idea that introspection, via software-as-microscope, is possible. Too much of our computing is directed to being strictly consumption, that I suspect few people will even think of being able to look at the innards. Think Wireshark for networks, source-level debuggers where you have source, or binary analysis tools where you don't. (Probably related, I got a Snapshot cartridge for the C64 as a youth, and was amazed at being able to capture the entire state of a program, fiddle with it, and save it as an executable to resume.)</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div> <div class="replies"><div id="2023-09-23T00:40:46.859Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Ivan Reese</span> <a href="./?fromDate=2023-09-20&amp;toDate=2023-09-26&amp;channel=thinking-together&amp;filter=#2023-09-23T00:40:46.859Z" class="date">2023-09-23 00:40:46</a> <div class="message"><p>Ah, lovely thoughts.

<p>The Snapshot cartridge struck me as miraculous. One physical button on the top, pushing that dropped you into a menu, with options such as a monitor to inspect the current state of the system. For a know-nothing kid, it was an eye-opener.</p>

<p>For web stuff, tools such as OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite may not tell you what server-side code does, but you can learn to infer quite a lot. Inspect the requests/responses, interrupt and fiddle or replay them, and so on.</p>
<p>I don't know about non-technical resources, but anything that integrated with a scripting environment would be more accessible to the layperson than most. ARexx for the Amiga for instance, to script and connect applications that support it. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARexx">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARexx</a>)  Or image-based environments that include documentation, and the ability to inspect the innards. Lisp environments perhaps, or SmallTalk.</p>

I owned a The Final Cartridge III. Learned so much by poking around a live system. Maybe that is indeed what makes Smalltalk (for me) such a great environment. Your suggestions inspire/evoke some thoughts if this can be broadened to not only the environment itself but a broader scope. Thx! 🙂</p>

<p>But this is really low level shizzle. Maybe not great for teaching. On the other hand...I liked it, why wouldn't other kids nowadays like it. Small poll: add a thumbs up if you also liked the low level debugging/hacking!</p>

<p>Some (potential) customers do find it difficult though, since they see it as a continuity risk for using "impopulair technology" 😉. To be fair, I do understand this feeling and it is something to weigh in when getting into the boat with us.</p>

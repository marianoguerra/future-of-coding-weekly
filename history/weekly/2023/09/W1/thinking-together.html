So.. why not use a full on logic language (prolog or something) to statically analyze your codebase instead of keep patching onto a type system, it appears to me that logic languages are simpler &amp; more expressive than most type systems. I'm starting to work on this for my language, and creating a logic language in efforts to also understand logic programming better.</p>
<p>Another advantage I can think of is that if a the logic language is expressive enough to type even the most advanced languages as well as the weakest, it could be used as a shared interface between languages to understand at least parts of each others type systems, as well as be a tool for user extension for additional static analysis specific to their project.</p>
<p>I'm basically thinking something like this.</p>
<pre><code># here's a sample program in my (object oriented) language

fn add(a, b) = a + b

add(1, 2)</code></pre><p>generated logic program in pseudo syntax ( <code>#A</code>  is a pattern to check value is type of  <code>A</code> ,  <code>?a</code>  is like prolog's  <code>A</code> ,  <code>{...}</code>   is map literal.)</p>
<pre><code>-- preloaded facts

lookup(#Number, :+, {args: [#Number, #Number], ret: #Number}).



-- program

add(?a, ?b, ?ret) :- lookup(?a, :+, {args: [?a, ?b], ret: ?ret}).

?- add(1, 2, ?_).</code></pre><p>The specifics of my logic language is likely flawed, but I'm curious about the general idea of using a fully-fledged logic language to generate a program in &amp; run instead of generated a typed AST and running ad-hoc type systems.</p>
<p>My question is, what are people's thoughts on this? Any previous work in this area? Any obvious flaws?</p>

The benefit of Relational Languages (PROLOG, miniKanren, etc). is that they specify ‚Äúwhat is wanted‚Äù (relations) instead of ‚Äúhow to create steps for achieving what is wanted‚Äù (3GLs like Python, Rust, Haskell, etc.)</p>

<p>There's no reason why the database generated from the logic language can't stick around to be queried for optimizations, right?</p>
<p>One thing that I imagine will require some work is interpreting errors (no answers found) for the results of running these programs. I'm imagining when this logic program runs it'll have to keep track of which queries / predicates succeeded &amp; which didn't - and something to make something like a stacktrace, maybe even track that in a logic db that can also be queried to emit domain specific (nice) error messages.</p>
<p>I think the big idea is having a database that contains really detailed statically analyzed facts which can be used to check correctness, do optimizations, or even help with automated refactoring tools. So it might not even need to be 1 logic language, but a shared database system which all the logic languages can speak &amp; store facts &amp; query from.</p>

<p>Technically, no. Socially, it means that the generation of important information is no longer under control of the compiler writer, and even language designer. They would have to cooperate with the users of their language and tool, and negotiate protocols for information exchange. It's more convenient to be a dictator.</p>

<p>1) There's the industry standard, like "a11y", which I would say is basically always great to have correctly implemented on any production app; generally if the tool can be consistently navigated/manipulated keyboard-only and readable by assistive technology, it is a good sign the UI architecture is sound;</p>
<p>2) There's the interpretation you mentioned that would be designing with a particular user need in mind, like for instance, one can literally blindfold  himself and optimize the tool for that particular usage context; that would quite surely make the tool "more accessible"; also, clearly great powers lie within optimizing for all human senses;</p>
<p>3) There's a third, quite literal, interpretation of "accessibility", as simply "having access at all to something". I personally have used that in the context of "live/visual programming can make technology more accessible", even simply because of ease of use, and mobile, etc. for instance.</p>

<p>Do you think this is always true? (showing my cards my whole  <em>thing</em>  and job revolves around accessibility and sort of trying to advocate for it to be a core part of the design/considerations for stuff...not just cream cheese applied at the end, or blueberries shoved into an already baked muffin.)</p>
<p>As example of how it could contribute to the design of a thing:</p>
<ul><li>say you need some metric to track the  <em>impact</em>  of enhancing accessibility?</li><li>an easy(ish) way to track this impact is to track  <em>completions</em>  wherein you define some set of tasks that can be completed within a system and then track what % of folks start the thing vs finish it</li><li>leveraging accessibility-first design when approaching that situation empowers you to start thinking about "escape hatches," and ways to optimize for completion. Whereas if you just try to make it  <em>accessible</em>  at the end you'd remediate any keyboard traps you accidentally made, maybe with this approach you would ask "if someone were to get trapped at this step what would they do? what way out and through can we provide even if trapped?"</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2023-08-30T11:13:16.359Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Jack Rusher</span> <a href="./?fromDate=2023-08-27&amp;toDate=2023-09-02&amp;channel=thinking-together&amp;filter=#2023-08-30T11:13:16.359Z" class="date">2023-08-30 11:13:16</a> <div class="message"><p>How I mean this is that if I want to experiment with, say, AR goggles, I‚Äôm not going to start from the position of ‚Äúhow will blind people use this display device?‚Äù Or if I want to build a two-handed input device, I‚Äôm not going to start from ‚Äúhow would a one-handed person use this?‚Äù</p>

<p>1) If my interface can be completely controllable/readable by voice, then any person (not only people with impaired vision for any reason) could use it in many arbitrary situations; I can program while cooking;</p>
<p>2) Similarly, if my system can be controlled completely by hand gestures, then I don't have to speak, or even touch the keyboard/mouse/touchpad; I can then build something very casually, like a game, using muscle memory alone; </p>
<p>3) Interesting research can be made on the ergonomics of interfaces considering arbitrary handicaps "Single Handed Programming", "Single Finger Coding", "Software Bending" (Programming using body gestures, which doesn't even exist yet), and their many design challenges' particularities;</p>
<p>4) The fact that one can program on the phone at all is a very sophisticated accessibility feat already, but (at least) that front gets talked about around as "Mobile First" design; still a very rare feat in current software ecosystem, especially for coding;</p>
<p>5) Repeat that for many devices (what about programming only with a joystick?) or body/mental state conditions (I have very little/high energy right now...) or environmental (would this tool be more helpful to code underwater?)... etc... etc...</p>
<p>These are a few examples of this unnamed phenomenon. I will try to compress it: "if you design with limitations in mind, the overall solution might improve". </p>

<p>Software crisis is a term used in the early days of computing science for the difficulty of writing useful and efficient computer programs in the required time. The software crisis was due to the rapid increases in computer power and the complexity of the problems that could not be tackled. With the increase in the complexity of the software, many software problems arose because existing methods were inadequate.</p>

<p> <code>The 6600 was three times faster than the previous record-holder, the IBM 7030 Stretch; this alarmed IBM. Then-CEO Thomas Watson Jr. wrote a memo to his employees on August 28, 1963: "Last week, Control Data ... announced the 6600 system. I understand that in the laboratory developing the system there are only 34 people including the janitor. Of these, 14 are engineers and 4 are programmers ... Contrasting this modest effort with our vast development activities, I fail to understand why we have lost our industry leadership position by letting someone else offer the world's most powerful computer." Cray's reply was sardonic: "It seems like Mr. Watson has answered his own question."</code> </p>

<p>The CDC 6600 was the flagship of the 6000 series of mainframe computer systems manufactured by Control Data Corporation. Generally considered to be the first successful supercomputer, it outperformed the industry's prior recordholder, the IBM 7030 Stretch, by a factor of three. With performance of up to three megaFLOPS, the CDC 6600 was the world's fastest computer from 1964 to 1969, when it relinquished that status to its successor, the CDC 7600.The first CDC 6600s were delivered in 1965 to Livermore and Los Alamos. They quickly became a must-have system in high-end scientific and mathematical computing, with systems being delivered to Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, CERN, the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, and many others. At least 100 were delivered in total.A CDC 6600 is on display at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. The only running CDC 6000 series machine has been restored by Living Computers: Museum + Labs.</p>

<p>But large companies are also wary of trusting any single individual with too much responsibility. They have to be prepared for anyone to jump to a different company at any moment. So just like the software, the organization itself is a distributed system with a high level of redundancy.</p>
<p>Startups usually can't afford to have that redundancy, at least in the early stages. I think they just accept a high risk of failure instead. And most of them do fall, but the handful that succeed are more productive by orders of magnitude.</p>

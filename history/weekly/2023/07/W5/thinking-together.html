<p>Those who are unfamiliar may not see the relevance of a building architect's work to programmers and software / hardware designers, but I assure you that his long history of work is exceptionally relevant.</p>
<p>His designs are a deeply-considered human-scale 'high-tech' alternative to traditionalist buildings and to postmodern buildings. With tonnes of innovative features which had never been implemented before and which seemed obvious and common-sense after the fact.</p>
<p>This work sounds a lot like what we are working on in the software, hardware and otherwise industrial realms.</p>
<p>If you are in Paris or are able to get to Paris, entry is 17 euros.</p>
<p>I'll be going on the 7th of August if anyone is around for drinks, lunch and/or a chat üôÇ</p>

At least at first glance, Foster seems diametrically opposed to Alexander (top-down design of large structures vs bottom-up design of small structures), though your description of Foster‚Äôs work as ‚Äúhuman-scale‚Äù suggests reality may be more complicated‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know much about Foster.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs fun to explore different possible points of contact between the fields! Thanks for the pointer.</p>

<p>A major figure of world architecture who is often seen as a leader of the "high tech" trend, British architect Norman Foster has designed many iconic creations throughout the world.&amp;amp;nbsp;</p>

It's an interesting read though it's probably best to leave it explained in their own words <a href="https://docs.cozodb.org/en/latest/releases/v0.6.html">docs.cozodb.org/en/latest/releases/v0.6.html</a></p>
<p>What do people think, is this approach plausible? Will it make a notcable different to what AI's can do? The author has also written their own knowledge management tool so interesting all round.</p>

I wonder how similar the DBs are. <a href="https://blog.vespa.ai/announcing-maximum-inner-product-search/">blog.vespa.ai/announcing-maximum-inner-product-search</a> </p>
<p>I‚Äôve been storing all the content the app I‚Äôm building creates in Vespa in the hope that it can makes sense of it in the way CozoDB seems to. </p>
<p>Comparing the latest technology to the human mind has been a human foible since the mind was compared to a waterwheel when that was the thing. I think AI is far from intelligent but  the lens it‚Äôs viewed through is too narrowly focused and Descartes set the aperture, so it can appear intelligent. </p>

<p>Vespa can now solve Maximum Inner Product Search problems using an internal transformation to a Nearest Neighbor search. This is enabled by the new dotproduct distance metric.</p>

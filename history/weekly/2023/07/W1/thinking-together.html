<p>Programs contain a lot of cross references that are resolved only after the parser/runtime have had a go. IDEs also redo this parsing work to simulate the same cross references for easy editing. The idea is to embed these references in the medium itself. So, get rid of import statements, file boundaries and such. Each textual reference - function name, type name, any identifier really - would be link to the object it references. Unlike strongly structured environments, this allows some flexibility in representing partial and possibly invalid structures. I‚Äôm interested in implementations you know of that match this idea.</p>

A combination of  <code>link</code>  and  <code>inline</code>  might subsume lots of ideas like Subtext and Brief (<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=R3MNcA2dpts">youtube.com/watch?v=R3MNcA2dpts</a>)</p>

<p>Hyperlinks are not mechanisms just to construct trees. Even in basic cases references form DAGs and even cycles. eg here‚Äôs a trivial DAG:</p>
<pre><code>class T: ...

def f1(a: T): ...

def f2(b: T):

  f1(b)</code></pre><p>The  <code>T</code>  annotation in both function definitions link to the class definition. The  <code>f1()</code>  call links to the  <code>f1</code>  function definition.</p>
<p>Any mutually recursive definition will form cycles.</p>
<p>Note also the hypertext objects here are individual definitions and dont impose any language semantics.</p>
<p>Not sure I understood the  <code>inline</code>  idea. Are you talking about transclusion?</p>

That's one of the principles of Smalltalk, and Smalltalk IDEs implement some of what is being discussed here, though only within the universe of the image.</p>
<p>Example: Glamorous Toolkit lets you see the definitions of methods you call inline, which is very convenient. Your outline of metaprograms defining programs which again contain dynamically resolved references is pretty much what people call metaprogramming in Smalltalk.</p>
<p>Pharo's relatively recent slot mechanism would allow implementing more general types of links, but I haven't seen this done.</p>
<p>Smalltalk users wouldn't call their code "hypertext" but rather "object graph", as much of the code structure never gets expressed as text. But that seems a minor technical detail to me.</p>

References get bound to objects when written. This is even earlier than in plain text compiled languages (identifiers in a text file are not bound at all). However the bindings-as-written are not the final bindings. During the course of meta-program and program execution they get rebound. Eg a reference to an abstract type may get re-bound to a concrete version of that type. Evolution of these bindings can be represented in the same structure.</p>
<p>Smalltalk / Newspeak etc are a key influence behind the above idea. In Smalltalk we write classes and their methods directly, not worrying about file boundaries. I was thinking why the method body is text and not hypertext? Maybe new versions of GT/Pharo do this better. GT still seems layered on rather than native.</p>

<blockquote><p>Where do you imagine the hyperlinks going to, other definitions?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes and also derived definitions (eg objects created via meta programming) and even runtime traces can link back to the definition objects.</p>
<blockquote><p>I‚Äôm wondering if the ability to click on hyperlinks is all we‚Äôre discussing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good question. Clickable links between source definitions exist in many environments. Even vscode lets me do that with most of my programs. However this is typically implemented as a layer on top of the underlying media (text files). The links may not match always actual semantics, but more importantly they do not navigate to  <em>derived</em>  definitions or connect runtime objects with definitions. In fact derived definitions are not typically available in the dev environment at all (smalltalk envs are the exception).</p>
<p>The idea is to use hypertext as a unifying interaction model between the person and the system - for hand written definitions, derived definitions as well as runtime traces. The hypertext ux would include clickable links and any other features we want to include eg inline content.</p>

<p>And the big practical issue in Smalltalk is that you get only the derived definitions, with no provenance tracking unless the metaprogramming framework has its own mechanism for that. But then, that's not a fundamental issue, it's part of the tooling layer.</p>

<p>This would be PL dependent but typically I imagine no in-place rebinding. However a form of rebinding happens by creating new versions of the hypertext objects. Eg the hand edited source objects could only be rebound by the user as part of editing. In the metaprogramming stage the system would create derived versions of these objects where some of the bindings have changed. For instance a binding to an abstract type in a source object may be resolved to a concrete subtype in the derived objects. So the PL semantics would also restrict what kinds of ‚Äúrebindings‚Äù happen. Eg ‚Äúconstants‚Äù would be bindings that don‚Äôt change in any derived objects.</p>

<p>Yes. I imagine viewing the source and various derived objects as distinct hypertext objects where you are able to go back and forth and follow the chain of provenance.</p>
<blockquote><p>Does your point against  <code>inline</code>  apply also to the very idea of hypertext? Why does the writer need to create hyperlinks, can the reader just have tools for all these transforms? That‚Äôs basically the world I live in today.</p>

<p>Good question. While it does bother me that the tooling overlaid links are an approximation (and poorer for dynamic langs generally), the bigger issue is the lack uniform navigation across derived definitions and source definitions.  I  <em>want</em>  to see the rendered macro, the concretized generic method and so on. I want to deftly bounce between those and the original source definitions.</p>
<p>BTW your earlier counterpoint of writer designed experience via  <code>inline</code>  is valid. I think the reader should still have the ability to customize it further (eg collapse an  <code>inline</code> ).</p>
<p>A related point is that reader doesn‚Äôt get to customize the text in text-file-as-code. For example if the writer chose to write  <code>import pandas as pd</code> , the reader has no choice but to see  <code>pd.foo</code>  scattered across the file. If this was hypertext-as-code, it‚Äôs easier for tools to offer customized rendering, eg ‚Äúshow the fully qualified name everywhere‚Äù, or ‚Äúshow the short name, but blue for  <code>pandas</code> ‚Äù and so on. In theory this is possible with text-file-as-code but more challenging, given that tooling is trying to simulate the PL semantics to extract high fidelity references.</p>

Now that I took the time to read them, I feel like overall it‚Äôs been time well spent (I got inspiration and encouragement for some projects).</p>
<p>I‚Äôd like to know if you know about the VPRI undertaking, and if you do, whether you read (some of) their papers/reports - see poll below. I‚Äôm also interested in similar experiences you had with other projects (thinking you know what they do, then having this understanding deepened by looking at their work more carefully).</p>

<p>üîµ I know about them, but don‚Äôt really know what they did.</p>
<p>üî¥ I know what they did, but read nothing from their writings.</p>
<p>üéØ I read some of their reports.</p>
<p>‚úÖ I read some of their reports and specific papers.</p>

<p>But there is so much more. I dream of starting a STEPS reboot that changes the context for building a complete environment in 20k LOCs from multimedia PC to today's mobile computing platforms. What would this look like if we assumed touch interaction and all the sensory input our mobile phones support was the baseline?</p>

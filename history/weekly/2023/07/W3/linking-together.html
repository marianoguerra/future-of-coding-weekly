Simon Peyton Jones &amp; Tim Sweeney | Lambda Days 2023</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Verse is a new programming language, being designed at Epic Games as the language of the metaverse. Verse is a functional logic language, with a bunch of innovative ideas. Like Haskell, Verse is declarative (a variable in Verse stands for just one, immutable value), and higher order (lambdas are first class). But Verse goes well beyond Haskell, with existential variables, unification, expressions that yield multiple values, and much more besides. In this talk we'll give you a sense of what functional logic programming is about, what it looks like to program in Verse, and how we can give meaning to Verse programs using rewrite rules.</p>

My work is less interested in making sure the program is correct, because I'm trying to do knowledge representation of a thing that might not be. Being able to still run queries when part of the code doesn't make any sense - because the law it models doesn't make any sense - is part of what I need. So verification is sort of worthless to me. The "we don't know, we might convert it to first order logic and throw z3 at it or something" approach seems a bit... sketchy. That doesn't give me a lot of hope that it delivers on the promises of validation. But co-opting a bunch of game developers into testing your language by deploying it as the scripting language for your huge hit game is a unique play.</p>

I heard recently with respect to craft (not software specifically, but craft in general):  <em>"Craft is not just the intent but also the hand of the maker and the process, trial, and error all coming together to make something careful and intentional."</em> Is the intention here shared between programmer and AI? Can we consider the AI to hold intent? Or are we moving into a world where some of that intention is lost?</p>

<p>gt4atproto is an environment for AT Protocol built in Glamorous Toolkit (GT). It covers several things at different levels of abstraction such as:
- Creating posts and threads from inside the knowledge management system.
- Working with a server through AT Protocol.
- Streaming and pagination support out of the box.
- Inspecting and visualizing results.
- Code generation from lexicons to Smalltalk code.
- Dedicated styling and completion support for editing lexicon JSON files.</p>

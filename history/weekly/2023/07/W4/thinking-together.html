This feels broken to me. In the visual interface, if you try to put something somewhere and it doesn't "fit", the piece doesn't go back where it started. It stays close to where you tried to put it, but far enough away to visually indicate that it isn't connected. So you get immediate feedback that it didn't work, and what was done instead. But in the text field, if I have "value" and I change it to "value$", and the dollar sign is invalid, the field will only turn red between when I hit dollarsign and when I hit enter, and then it will go back to the previous value, and just hope I notice that it didn't do what I wanted it to do. For people who look at the keys while typing, that's not going to work. Blockly steadfastly tries to avoid invalid state, presumably because syntax errors aren't any fun. But in the visual interface it accomplishes that by making invalid syntax impossible to generate, and when it modifies the syntax for you to keep it valid, that's easy to see. Here, it lets you type an invalid value, let's you hit enter, and the fact it didn't work is potentially invisible. It feels like it should be possible to do better. Has anyone seen an interface for entering values into a text field that solves this problem? Where the field maintains a valid value, starting with a default, but it also allows you to maintain a view on failed attempts to modify it, so that you can correct them? Should the screen just go modal, not responding to "enter" or clicks outside the editor while the value is invalid? Should the failed attempt to change it be noted somewhere? Or is maintaining valid state in text fields a silly goal, and instead you should just throw errors at a later step, or something?</p>

Other idea: each text field stores both the last user input, possibly invalid, ("draft"?) and the last valid, active value, with really clear UI about what text is currently active: probably invalid draft text off to the side in red. Or possibly a "restore 'my previous valid text'" operation if you go the throw-errors path.</p>
<p>I think it's really important not to casually throw away user input even if it's invalid. It might contain a pretty significant bit of work (e.g. digging through an obtuse document for the exact right term) that's only slightly invalid, e.g. only typo'd. And if the user trusts the computer to remember it, they're liable to completely flush it from their mind until they come back later to an error message or mysterious reversion to the old value, whereupon they feel both frustrated and betrayed. :melting_face: (I think I'm preaching to the choir here, just had to vent dredged-up memories of frustrating software)</p>
<p>I think a modal  <em>dialog</em> , front and center on the screen, might be ok, albeit clunky. But just stopping responding to clicks elsewhere is exactly the kind of interaction that gives modal interfaces a bad name. The scenario when this whole thing is a problem is when the user's locus of attention moves away "prematurely", which is the exact reason they'll be confused and frustrated when the rest of the UI "freezes".</p>

Something like that? I'm also imagining a "current value" non-editable element, and a usually hidden "set to" element that hides when it succeeds or is cancelled, stays visible otherwise. Not sure what that would look like, but it wouldn't require you to solve the validity problem first, which seems like an improvement.</p>

<p>I personally hate editors that try to maintain a valid value at all times. When you are sketching something out you want to be able to just put crap like "??? salary ??? wealth ???" as placeholders for half thought out ideas. I really think that thinking tools need to be really, really cautious about editing what the user has input.</p>
<p>Why do you need to maintain valid values only? Can't you just disable whatever feature requires this until they provide them? This is a meaningful quid pro quo for the user. If you  <em>don't want</em>  the quo right now (i.e. I know this code doesn't compile, I'm not asking for that), it's very, very frustrating to be forced to swallow the quid (valid syntax)</p>

That's not impossible, but it would make things clunky, and I don't actually have strings as a data type in the tool, right now. Chris, I don't actually know if maintaining validity is worth it. It's just the approach taken by the library, which I'm assuming is better informed than I am about learning outcomes. My instinct is to override the current behaviour and just leave the thing highlighted red, and refuse to save.</p>

I've explored drag-and-drop a lot in the past and I feel that in order to be discoverable and memorable as an interaction it helps to deal with very concrete object representations. IDK what dragging an email into a tag "is" in the world, I can't imagine doing that with a physical letter and a sticky tag. It doesn't have to have a literal real-world analogue, but the way the software models the objects has to give them a clear physical identity in the visual space (like dragging items to reorder in a list: each item has a physical identity, and you manipulate a direct and visible relationship).</p>
<p>To be not just discoverable, but actually useful, dnd has to also be more efficient than a direct interaction. e.g. I  <em>could</em>  physically understand the action of picking up a tag and dragging it onto an email to classify it, but it's much easier to just press the tag as a button to toggle it.</p>
<p>dnd for file attachments hits both of these. I am paperclipping this file from my workspace onto this message, and it's so much faster than digging through file hierarchies to find the file I probably already have open in my file manager.</p>

<p>Not just that, but the keyboard shortcuts are  <em>disabled by default</em> , one step further than not telling the user about them.</p>
<p>Which makes me think it‚Äôs an intentional design choice:</p>
<p>Perhaps they are intentionally limiting the feature to advanced users who think about ‚Äúhow can I be more efficient with Gmail‚Äù and are proactive enough to seek out and enable such a feature?</p>
<p>Or maybe it‚Äôs the inverse: the Gmail team wants to avoid confusing newbies, who might accidentally activate the shortcuts and have no idea WTH just happened?</p>

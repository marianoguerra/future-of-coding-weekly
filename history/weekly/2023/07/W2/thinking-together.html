<p>I get this completely - but it's a whole nuther thread really. For the sake of this discussion, imagine a non-intrusive AR tech that's fully under your control, etc.</p>

<p>Of course, but then outside of your Dynamicland projectors room, you'll still need to do stuff also. Do you think DL is better than AR? Are you skeptical of DL as a primary computer interface?</p>

<p>You're suggesting we use AR specs (or whatever) instead of projectors — that covers the  <em>output</em>  side of the system. So what do we use instead of physical materials for  <em>input</em>  side?</p>

<p>I think with good hand recognition you could simulate physical objects digitally that would be needed for input (e.g. pieces of paper, buttons, knobs). The main thing missing would be tactile feedback.</p>

That's why I'm curious about Duncan's contention that Dynamicland could be done  <em>better</em>  with AR specs. DL seems to be largely about embracing the real world, and the human beings in it. It defines itself in contrast to traditional computers. So I want to know if by "better" Duncan means (to be a bit glib) "get rid of all that stuff that makes DL what it is and just go back to a more traditional computer approach, but with AR specs, because traditional computers are better", or if he means "here's a way to satisfy the goals of DL without as many downsides"</p>

It would basically work the same as in DL: the camera picks up what's going on (both with hands and with physical objects on the table). AR "embraces the real world" by definition, but can also allow someone remote to be present.</p>
<p>I just think the "stuff that makes DL what it is" isn't the blobby paper, which I think is quite a distraction. If you allow AR instead of all the blobby paper then the real points can come across.</p>

Tell them about the joys of a simple reverse chronological timeline, where the vendor doesn't decide which posts to show you first. Tell them about the flexibility and compatibility that comes from open standards. Tell them about how decentralized systems are resilient against corporate censorship.</p>

<p>I start wondering what "walled garden" means. I don't think it means, "nobody can get in." Facebook has had pretty terrible security at various points in its life, to the extent that other companies were able to crawl vast swathes of it. Rather, in a walled garden information is being created within at such a prodigious rate that it takes a lot of resources for an attacker to keep up. Walls are for the plebes. So "walling off against Facebook" seems like an ill-posed idea.</p>

<p>:pixel-chickadee: yes! </p>
<p>I think there are 2 things a walled garden is: </p>
<ul><li>a physical (or digital) apparatus of separation (so that there can be an “in” and an “out”)</li><li>and a set of “rules” or norms that govern the interior space</li></ul><p>Gates and gate keeping. </p>
<p>So, an alternative: (heavy handed) </p>
<p>Lighthouses and ships. </p>
<p>The boundary is softer here. There’s not a magic circle (uh, oh, danger term) but there’s a discrete node (lighthouse) that connects the ships — makes them aware of one another and some geography. </p>
<p>I think a <a href="https://planet.scheme.org">planet</a> is like this. A thing that connects a bunch of otherwise discrete folks around a common facet — webrings, too</p>

I just finished listening to the episode, "Interpreting the Rule(s) of Code by Laurence Diver". I wasn't sure it was going to hook me, but am so glad it did. I had a few thoughts bounce around as I was listening, though dog-walking on a trail. Hopefully they make some sense now.</p>
<p>Where Ivan was talking about the problem of a program only being able to handle conditions for which it was designed, with no escape hatch, I wondered about exposing something like the restarts that Common Lisp has in its REPL. This probably isn't something you would offer to a user that you didn't trust with a REPL, but perhaps encountering a problem could default to selections of alternate solutions that are offered to the user. When restarts are offered in CL, the program execution is paused, so the choices for the user have all the context of what is on the stack at the time. Rather than just aborting (which is one option), one might take an extra step back and try something different. Web checkouts typically have a weak form of this, but I thought that perhaps very binary conditional checks could often be replaced with "one of" or combinations of options. Don't have that right address? (RR 2, Pfff!). Include some other means of providing a location that is accepted. Maybe some form of fuzzy logic, albeit unfashionable these days, guides the programmer into accepting a combination of responses that satisfy their fraud-prevention algorithm when taken together.</p>

<p>One thought that I had meant to share in the show, but forgot to mention, is that there is actually one escape hatch available to us web developers — the browser dev tools! I'm sure we've all skipped a paywall or fixed a broken form by popping the hood and tweaking the HTML/CSS of some page.</p>
<p>I'm not familiar enough with CL to follow the idea of "restarts" as you've described them. But I like the idea about fuzzy logic + allowing the user to specify data in a that satisfies some program in a format that works for the user.</p>
<p>And yes&nbsp;—&nbsp;"Computer says no" — absolute classic!</p>

<p>On the CL side, that restart example looks at reading files with an invalid entry, and three basic options: skip the entry, skip the file, or provide some default value. A handler is added for each, and the caller can choose which one to use... or none of them, and call another handler function of its own choice.</p>
<p>Choosing no handler, an interactive debugger gives the programmer the option to browse through the calling stack, look at local variables, and edit the definition of one of the functions in the chain. Sounds basic, except that it can be recompiled on the fly, and then the newly-edited function can be called again by restarting that stack frame, and continuing as if nothing had ever been wrong. I find this sort of thing very useful when it might be difficult to get to the specific state that triggered a condition. Maybe the browser debugger can do something similar?</p>

<p>We programmers always laugh at spreadsheet's use of coordinates ("like machine code without assembly") but few users avail themselves of features to name ranges / structured/hierarchical data etc.</p>
<p>But there are real annoyances with what-you-see-is-what-you count consecutive coordinates:  They  <em>mostly</em>  shift correctly on insertions/deletions, BUT one needs to grok $A4 vs. B$7 notation, which I suspect many don't.  Getting range E3:F34 boundaries for formulas  <em>exactly</em>  right is always a hassle.</p>
<p>So I wonder if features like named ranges are "premature formalization" then maybe "structured numbers" in the BASIC's style could serve as more accessible "semi-formalization"?</p>
<p>BASIC users quickly learnt conventions like "increment by 10, start functions on hundreds, big modules on thousands".  And this allowed them to avoid re-numbering almost entirely!</p>
<p>(This was good UX in teletype line-editor era 🖨, and of course now we have full-screen editors and can insert/delete — no need to "increment from 10 to 20 so you can later insert 15".</p>
<p>But a 2nd aspect that imho was really genius was the numbers were  <em>stable</em> , helping your brain 🚲🧠.  Your transcript 📜 had partial  <code>LIST</code> ings, followed by chains of edit actions (poor man's git) + REPL experiments, and the fact that line 60 remains 60 throught helped you mentally interpret that history — making you a better debugging detective 🕵️‍♀️.  It's insane to remember what  <code>GOSUB 437</code>  means; easier if you  <em>assign</em>  semi-systematic round  <code>GOSUB 2100</code> .)</p>
<p>So, suppose spreadsheets let you use higher numbers/column names freely, by skipping display of unoccupied rows/columns.</p>
<ul><li>If you have a long table that might grow, you won't put  <code>=SUM(...)</code>  computation directly beneath it; you put it at next 100 or 1000 — but it will still display close to its bottom.  And you can type the range as  <code>10:99</code>  from the start.</li><li>With some foresight allocating "big enough" ranges for tables, you might never run into situations where  <code>$B7</code>  vs.  <code>B$7</code>  matters.  (This means spreadsheet should become smarter yet in renumbering on insert/delete — do shift rows/columns, but stop at next unoccopied "moat".)</li><li>To introduce users to the idea, don't show consecutive numbers/letters.  Even in an empty spreadsheet, after some rows/columns, skip to some far-away numbers like 100 and 1000!</li><li>Perhaps it might also subsume the feature of "freezing" some rows/column from scrolling?  mockup below has one fake "scrollbar" to suggest a portion could be scrolled separately.</li></ul><p>attaching a mockup to this thread (drawn in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tQt2MgCaqkJGvyPvsqxTDfo3AurgWptWBg03TZr07zo/edit?usp=sharing">regular spreadsheet</a>😉)</p>

<p>On the viz side, the trick is how to improve this. Today, at least in Excel, you have the worksheet model, and that's all you get for  UI (bear with me). e.g. you can't make a table and pop it up in it's own window. Worksheets are a flat stack, rather than something like MDI child windows. But what if you  <em>could</em>  do that, maybe something like Oberon or totally free-form. If you  <em>want</em>  to merge them all into a flat worksheet, their range IDs provide the layout positions, but they also have names and can be addressed relatively that way as well.</p>

<p>Sure, I've seen some people play with rich text in their code editor, applying bold or font size the same way you apply color. Atom's CSS was great. But that's outside the code. Your font size tweaks aren't going in the repo. (That'd be a tabs vs spaces fight for the ages!)</p>
<p>But… what if I want to leave a little pocketbook tucked into the back flap of a function? Unobtrusive. It's there as a reference when you need it. Within, you can fully explain why things are the way they are. You can talk about the history of this code. It's the sort of stuff that you'd put into a wiki, or spread across a series of commit messages — but it's right there in the codebase,  <em>but</em>  it's tiny and off to the side. There when you need it, easy to ignore when you don't.</p>
<p>Makes me wonder about other ways that being able to choose the size of representation in a program — independently from typical size units of code (ie: lines) — could be useful. Eg: at the main entry point of a well-factored complex program, where you're dispatching off to various other subsystems, things deserve to be quite large.</p>
<p>Makes me wonder about other things that ought to live inside the codebase. To start: every feature of Github? (Consider that it serves their interests that, say, the discussion around an issue or PR lives on their cloud, not in the repo.)</p>

<p>I quite like this thought from <strong>@Grant Forrest</strong>. This is one of the big critiques of node-wire visual programming — it's "visual" in only the shallowest sense, because the visual design is half-devoid of semantics. The spatial arrangement of nodes has meaning to the human programmer, but not to the computer. It would be nice to play with a visual programming system that allowed for both.</p>

<p>While it may make sense to change how things look, I imagine many of us remember the early days of desktop publishing, 3D borders in GUIs, circus-inspired web pages, etc. The goal is to communicate meaning and intent clearly, in context, but also let people find more information as needed or desired. So, rather than text size, what if this content became links, maybe with a preview popup? Things can be smaller, but still a paragraph long, which makes them either hard to read or take up so much space that you lose more active content.

<p>A good experiment would be to take a non-tiny piece of software and do this. It's largely aligned with Literate Programming, so yes it's been done. Why didn't LP win? Many reasons and mine would only be anecdotal. I love the idea in theory but, having tech edited and co-authored books, I'm much happier writing code. I'm also a lot better at it. There are two different skills at play.</p>
<p>Another pretty easy experiment is to take a codebase and simply write a ToC and index for it, like a book would have.</p>
<p>Consider, also, that formatting is intended to aid the reader. This is what we should all do. Who us our reader? It's not a novel, or a play, or a textbook, or a newspaper. But if we take those as examples, how much variety is there in typography? Not much. Mostly it's about structure.</p>

<p>Why  <em>should</em>  code look like manuscript? The use case and needs are very different. Code is fundamentally non-linear.</p>
<p>I mean, to the extent that we have zero typography in code, sure, anything would be an improvement. But I think it would quickly hit diminishing returns. It would be a strategic dead end. The typographic needs of code need to be rethought from scratch.</p>

<blockquote><p>Makes me wonder about other ways that being able to choose the size of representation in a program — independently from typical size units of code (ie: lines) — could be useful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One place I would have loved this is when I was trying to grok Lisp interpreters. The classic Lisp interpreter looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>def eval(form, env):

  case

    ... -&gt; eval(..., env)

    ... -&gt; eval(..., env)

    ...

  end

end</code></pre><p>Basically you have a large number of branches, and each of them has some complicated expression that passes  <code>env</code>  around. For more real-world codebases (like <a href="https://github.com/arclanguage/anarki">github.com/arclanguage/anarki</a> or <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/bel.html">paulgraham.com/bel.html</a>) each case might be complex enough to require a helper. In which case you now have a maze of  <em>mutually</em>  recursive calls. And often the case that actually  <em>uses</em>   <code>env</code>  is just one line deep inside one of the helpers. All the other mentions of  <code>env</code>  exist just to plumb it through to that one line. It would be great to typeset all the mentions of  <code>env</code>  in small font size, but magnify the font size of  <code>env</code>  in that one line.</p>
<p>And this is just one argument. If you look at Bel's source code, there's a half dozen such arguments being plumbed through in a similar pattern that would benefit from this sort of visual salience management.</p>

<p>Reminds me of some paper I've seen attaching hand-written ink annotations to code.  don't remember the specific paper, but found now several on <a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~beryl/mypublications.html">Beryl Plimmer's publications</a>, sounds like a good starting point...</p>
<p>(I have to question the long-term accuracy of anything you can't grep, but actually handwriting recognition might mean you can, and anyway there is interesting value in enabling the kind illustrations we tend to draw on whiteboards but rarely commit.)</p>
<p>Varying font size go nicely with zooming!  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/code-canvas/">Code Canvas</a> tried quite a lot of that.  Imperfect aesthetics, but some interesting gradual-reveal functionality 👍</p>
<p><a href="https://eaglemode.sourceforge.net/">eaglemode.sourceforge.net</a> file manager does quite unusual UI tricks with zooming and font sizes – e.g. instead of tooltips, UI elements (buttons etc) documentation is engraved right on them in tiny font.  See "project philosophy" there.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://museapp.com/">museapp.com</a>.</p>
<p>Prototyping tips: (1) Emacs supports varying fonts. The poster child is <a href="https://www.ubuntupit.com/best-latex-editor-reviewed-for-linux-nerds/#h-22-emacs-with-auctex">latex</a> but you can apply it to any kind of syntax-highlight.  Plus various support for folding. (2) on the web, <a href="https://codemirror.net/5/demo/variableheight.html">CodeMirror</a>.</p>

<p>Emacs has many packages to add custom "faces" (its term for stylable fonts, a-la CSS class) to things like "TODO" or any regexp really, so you could add some custom "constructs".  (OTOH really customizing the font-lock parsing is ...ad-hoc pain. maybe LSP-mode makes that more approachable?)</p>

<blockquote><p>having tech edited and co-authored books, I'm much happier writing code. I'm also a lot better at it. There are two different skills at play.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I definitely think there is an element to this. I am certainly more verbose than most of my co-workers — well, oddly, maybe more verbose in issues and merge requests, and perhaps more terse in code. That said — I'm personally thinking  <em>less</em>  of literate programming and  <em>more</em>  of fancy syntax highlighting.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mostly it's about structure.</p>

<p>Yes, exactly! What ways can we devise to communicate that structure more effectively to our brains?</p>

IDK how to even describe what I'm thinking of but I feel like it must exist, or maybe be theoretical in the emerging AI models of creating software.</p>
<p>Kind of fuzz testing, I guess. My brain is going somewhere bigger with this, though, maybe I'll check in with it again once I find time to finish the podcast.</p>

My wife worked at a legal research company for a while and she kept pausing the podcast (I subjected her to) to comment on the legal side of things. One thing she pointed out is that civil law is about codifying and interpreting laws to judge situations, but  <em>common law</em>  is basically a series of precedents. You try a case, if it's novel you invent a judgment. If it's similar to a previous case you adopt/adapt the previous judgment and it becomes a new more refined precedent for future situations.</p>
<p>Not sure the mapping here. I'm imagining when Ivan puts in his address to buy a ticket, instead of "invalid address" and end of story, the software responds, "this format of address is new to us, please await trial" and forwards it to the Airline Judge who renders judgment that is then encoded as precedent in the software itself.</p>

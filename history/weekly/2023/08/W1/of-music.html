We are truly lucky to have a recording of an interview of Jimmy Webb done by someone who has a clue and had the balls to stump up his own money to make it happen.</p>
<p>Why should you care?</p>
<p>Quantization is not the only way to deep dive into a subject. Developing theories about monads will never help you create content as good as what Jimmy Webb created.  No type-checked language is ever going to touch as many humans as “The Witchitaw Lineman”.  An interesting question is “Why?“.  I think that Raskin’s “The Humane Interface” was just beginning to scratch the surface of this question, along with Norman’s “The Design of Everyday Things”.</p>
<p>In songwriting, there is the concept of “co-writing”.  1+1=3.  The best creations come from teams of people with  <em>complementary</em>  skills.  Everybody in the room gets an equal cut.  Isolationist songwriters sometimes succeed, but co-writing teams succeed more often.</p>

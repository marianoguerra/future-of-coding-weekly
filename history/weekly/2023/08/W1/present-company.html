<p>Yes, the impetus is to use this for personal notes, not a pre-existing source of this information</p>
<p>Some form of hypertext (in the general sense) seems likely to be involved, yes. I go back and forth over whether it would be preferable to have a text-document-based representation vs a graphical representation (more like a mind map). Maybe the fact that I haven’t enjoyed mind map tools means that text-document-based would be better. Bidirectional linking is very important, so vanilla HTML would not be enough. But this makes me realize I could probably prototype it in either vanilla HTML or Obsidian.</p>
<p>There’s a catch-22 where it’s not motivating for me to start recording a lot of info until I have the tool I want to use, and it’s hard to pick a tool until I have the information recorded 🙂 Maybe there’s a way to cut that knot somehow.</p>

<p>I stay away from most mind-mapping tools because they want you to predict how you are going to lay stuff out according to their ideas of what you want, instead of allowing you to lay stuff out the way you want to.</p>
<p>For that kind of reason, I look for tools that let me slap down ideas with no friction, then apply structure afterwards, iteratively.</p>
<p>Currently, I use Kinopio, and, before that, Scapple.  I use Obsidian to write longer paragraphs, but, it (like most markdown tools) want you to lay things out in a linear manner...</p>
<p>[I was originally attracted to Kinopio because it can export to JSON, but it turns out that I haven’t needed this feature yet]</p>

In some cases, though, the connectors make immediate sense and I put them in as I dump ideas.

<p>I tend to think every time a new medium is introduced, all the contents of the previous medium are ported over,  <em>without regard for fully understanding the new medium</em> . For instance, films matured when it stopped porting over books, games matured when it stopped porting over movies, etc. An excellent example of this is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/">Outer Wilds</a>, a space-exploration time-traveling game which is simply impossible to recreate in any other medium. It fulfills the medium.</p>
<p>Given that, I think two new forms of medium are being introduced in the next 5 years: <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-paradigm/#:~:text=Summary%3A%20AI%20is%20introducing%20the,reversing%20the%20locus%20of%20control.">LLMs</a> and VR. If we accept the supposition that there will be a lot of retrofitting of the medium, i.e. chat into LLMs, games into VR,  <em>what are the content that will truly fulfill the mediums of LLMs and VR?</em> </p>

<p>LLMs: Chat with PDFs is retrofitting. Perhaps a different kind of UX to deeply interact with difficult words on paper? LLMs can create a tree of concepts, so for difficult words (e.g. homotopy), selecting them would display a tree of related concepts (like homeomorphism), right within the PDFs. Other good ideas <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/lm-sketchbook">here</a> and <a href="https://www.noya.io/">here</a>.</p>
<p>VR: Ideas as physical objects? Maybe a 3d notetaking app, but instead of notes being rectangles, they can be any shapes.</p>

<p>So, for film, that would be building up a toolkit of specifically filmic story telling techniques that are born from film, rather than another medium (but may then find their way into other mediums)</p>
<p>With video games, these techniques are often game mechanics ‚Äî but also can overlap with animation, etc.</p>
<p>By attributing ‚Äúmaturity‚Äù to this sort of technique, I think you can start to decouple the medium and the message a little.</p>

I dig that question so hard!</p>
<p>well, my academic background is in theory and art history ‚Äî there, new vocabulary comes in through a few different processes, but, the easiest to trace is often  <em>borrowing</em> , e.g. there exists a body of work that talks about painting, BOOM! Photography explodes into the art scene, so, at first, folks write about photography by borrowing terms from painting, often times focusing on the differences and similarities between the 2 mediums‚Ä¶over time, those terms transform, new terms/vocabulary are invented to begin to wrestle with that new stuff photography is bringing to the plate</p>

It reads to me like there is an isomorphism with scientists trying to explain a new phenomenon with existing theories, e.g. Newtonian mechanics not being enough to explain phenomena near light speed. I understand the "new stuff" you mention as different affordances/spaces/possibliites that must be wrestled with.</p>
<p>I guess new vocabulary is created in the chemical reaction/wrestling/resistance between the borrowed terms and the new phenomena. So perhaps operationally,</p>
<ul><li>Don't settle for the borrowed terms. Keep looking for new phenomena and "react" with borrowed terms.</li><li>Borrow not from the direct parent of the new medium, but somewhere else. Maybe vocabulary in games (e.g. juice) is useful for understanding LLMs. Determination of which arbitrary medium to borrow from would also be interesting.</li></ul><p>I am also thinking, which field has the most experience dealing with this phenomenon of creating new vocabulary? They would have the most meta-models regarding new vocabulary. The top candidate seems to be art, right? The ultimate medium of mediums. Tools for thought can also be rendered as tools for expression.</p>

So the UI is text right? Or even with current speech recognition the obvious UI is answer and response. That‚Äôs the most efficient way we communicate, but what we say rarely is what‚Äôs received but our internal error checking irons out most misunderstandings quickly. Also if the person you‚Äôre speaking to gives a puzzled expression that‚Äôs a huge amount of information for you and you‚Äôll reformat your speech. LLMs have none of those abilities which makes them pretty inefficient when they misunderstand. LLMs are a flawed model of human communication. I hope we don‚Äôt bend ourselves out of shape to compensate. But the medium is not new IMHO. </p>

In addition, I am curious about the effects of the definition, as in the utility of it. I am getting the sense that LLMs and VR are viewed as flawed versions of mediums that already exist in reality, thus not new medium. That feels like retrofitting LLM and VR to reality. Surely they look similar to reality rn (or try to), but they will mature.</p>
<p>A weak example is electronic music, which developed into a field of its own. Or texting, which is different from phone calls, which is different from physical comversation. Messaging apps nowadays have reactions, which allow you to juggle talking about multiple things at the same time.</p>
<p>All of this discussion (personally) is for developing interesting pieces of technology within VR, or through LLMs. I would imagine thinking of them as flawed rendition of reality would not help in furthering what can be done. I think we can go further than imitating human communication (which already is cool).</p>

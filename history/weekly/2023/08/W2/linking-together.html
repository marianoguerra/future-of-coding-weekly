To improve on CellPond, you'd want to make it more of a 'hybrid' with other stuff.</p>
<p>It's not exactly the same, but I think this paper's concept of 'composability' touches on some of that!</p>
<p>I think that combining live+rich editors together often has the 'lego brick problem'. Combining them together often feels like attaching lego bricks. As in - there are predefined places (studs) where you can place them. You're quite restricted with what can go where. It feels plastic, and hard. I use <a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/fusion">Davinci Resolve's Fusion</a> quite a lot, and it certainly feels like that to me (see attached image).</p>
<p>Textual code doesn't feel plastic. It feels like 'playdough'. You can mold different parts together, so that they become interlaced. There's a lot more freedom. I think a great example for this is <a href="https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a>. You can compose HTML and Javascript together in any sort of way you want. It doesn't feel restricted, and you aren't stuck with the hard plastic borders caused by keeping them in different files.</p>
<p>That being said, the 'plastic-ness' of live editors is often a feature. eg: <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/about">Scratch</a> feels restrictive because it wants to stop you from making mistakes. This is great! But how can we do that while maintain some more 'playdoughyness'?</p>
<p>I've spoken a bit with <a href="https://elliot.website/">Elliot Evans</a> about this, as I think that his <a href="https://youtu.be/r--d5XlUyT4">ideas about carets</a> tackle this problem really well!! (for <a href="https://elliot.website/editor/">Polytope</a>)</p>
<p>I'm also interested in <a href="https://ivanish.ca/hest-podcast/">Hest</a> because of its focus on 'continuous-ness' of data. Sounds less rigid to me.</p>
<p>And I'm currently working on a weird thing called Arroost, which aims to be more reflective and intra-composable. Its output is 'more of itself', so it allows a bit more of that. I wouldn't say it's composable, but it's an experimental step towards it.</p>
<p>Anyway, really useful paper! It's given me more of the language and context for exploring this sort of thing!</p>

<p>The document discusses qualities that are important for programming beyond static text. It identifies three main qualities - liveness, richness, and composability.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>This allows domain-specific interactive programming tools to be integrated into general-purpose environments with full liveness. The document argues this can unlock new value for live and rich tools and programming research by enabling composition. It lays out a vision for further exploring the design space at the intersection of liveness, richness, and composability.</p>

<p>I agree with your articulation of the ‚Äòlego brick problem‚Äô. I have a prototype approach to composing live &amp; rich tools* and I occasionally feel that it suffers from this problem ‚Äì that the layers of abstraction around components are overly stiff and don‚Äôt afford composition as natural and combinatorially rich as I‚Äôd hope. But then I remember that the status quo is ‚Äúno composition at all,‚Äù so, y‚Äôknow, baby steps.</p>

It's a significant barrier to entry for many people who really want to learn to program, and those who claim otherwise are textbook examples of survivor bias. <a href="https://mastodon.social/deck/@tess/110856324920882032">https://mastodon.social/deck/@tess/110856324920882032</a></p>

<p>My language choice these days is almost 100% dictated by the community contributed library ecosystem.</p>
<p>That said, Carmack was talking specifically about languages themselves, so I think I agree with him</p>

Exponential as a function of what?</p>
<p>Anyway, it's important to remember the staggering levels of programming power that have become our baseline expectation. We take higher order functions for granted, forgetting that people used to program in assembly, to say nothing of plugboards. So, "compounding"? I don't know. And it's not impossible that we've picked all the order-of-magnitude fruits. But to say that there are no order of magnitude gains in language tech at all ignores history.</p>

<p>I hadn't thought about it on a long time scale, but that's a good point. It also made me think even if "better" languages are developed and not widely used, they can still have a big impact since they can act as proof of concept and good ideas from them can make their way into more popular languages.</p>

<blockquote><p>Critical code studies is the application of the hermeneutics of the humanities to the interpretation of the extra-functional significance of computer source code. ‚ÄúExtra‚Äù here does not mean ‚Äúoutside of‚Äù or ‚Äúapart from‚Äù but instead it refers to a significance that is ‚Äúgrowing out of‚Äù an understanding of the functioning of the code.</p>

<p>This piece also links to a few other interesting resources on the subject, including, the <a href="https://electronicbookreview.com/essay/critical-code-studies/">initial manifesto for critical code studies.</a></p>
<p>I also liked this quote,</p>
<blockquote><p>Still, reading code, even <em>without</em> interpreting its cultural significance, can be no easy task. Ask a professional programmer who inherits legacy code to maintain or, worse yet, to improve, and they will tell you about the dread of sorting out just-in-time code, minimally documented, written with hasty patches, full of compromises and workarounds. Even those who write their code in artistic projects can be shy about sharing their code out of embarrassment and self-consciousness. This shame is a product of the ‚Äúencoded chauvinism‚Äù of programming culture, one that can be fostered on the internet as much as it is in classrooms [

<blockquote><p>Currently, all of computer code lies before us with single quotation marks preceding its lines. While we examine programming architecture and admire modularity and efficiency, the study of computer code does not currently emphasize interpretation, the search for and production of meaning. Even when aesthetics intervene, they come in the form of calls for stylistic clarity for more efficient modification and development. This emphasis on functionality neglects the meaning that code bears for its human audience. For code, especially mid- to high-level languages, exists not solely for computers, which could operate on machine language (essentially, representations of electronic signals), but for programmers as well. Therefore, the computer may be one recipient of the code but there is also the programmer, other programmers, and at times even users who have access to its text.</p>

<ul><li>It doesn't perpetuate the false dichotomy between inside and outside, interface and implementation. The code for a product is just another view on the product, and the interface for browsing the code is designed like a product. That duality and the easy way to bounce between the two promises lots of tight feedback loops in many dimensions. Other projects like Excel share this property, often by dumbing down the internals. Excel focuses on data to the exclusion of code, etc.</li><li>The code feels like an organism, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Timeless_Way_of_Building">alive</a>. I was reminded of experiences playing StarCraft where you lay out a few things and then can often watch how things play out once the battle starts. The surface the code lies on feels alive like an eco-system, particularly when you take the hierarchical structure into account. It feels like a jungle you could immerse yourself in. And I really like the idea that giving it detailed simulation of physics leads to an aesthetic environment.</li><li>You can see values flowing through the code. Many other programming models struggle to integrate the two. Showing example values next to code feels like a hack compared to this. The way you pause computations feels organic. Spreadsheets hide the dataflow which hinders debugging.</li><li>Mobile friendly. I almost missed this. This is potentially huge. There's an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091203074752/http://ycombinator.com/rfs5.html">almost 15-year old open question</a> of how people might develop on small screens.

I wonder if there are any implications here for editing programs? Some of the ideas ‚Äî like comments ‚Äî we usually take for granted in programming. But maybe there are some other worth-while take-aways?</p>
<blockquote><p> Let me speak generally for a moment. I've concluded that there are two basic metaphors for pre-computer writing. One is the long-hand manuscript page. The other is the typewritten page. Most word processors have decided to emulate the second ‚Äî and, at first glance, that would seem to be the logical one to adopt. But, as a creative writer, I am convinced that the long-hand page is the better metaphor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider: On a long-hand page, you can jump back and forth in your document with ease. You can put in bookmarks, either actual paper ones, or just fingers slipped into the middle of the manuscript stack. You can annotate the manuscript for yourself with comments like "Fix this!" or "Don't forget to check these facts" without there being any possibility of you missing them when you next work on the document. And you can mark a block, either by circling it with your pen, or by physically cutting it out, without necessarily having to do anything with it right away. The entire document is your workspace.</p>
<p>On a typewritten page, on the other hand, you are forced to deal with the next sequential character. Your thoughts are focussed serially on the typing of the document. If you're in the middle of a line halfway down page 7, your only easy option is to continue on that line. To go backwards to check something is difficult, to put in a comment that won't show when your document is read by somebody else is impossible, and so on. Typing is a top-down, linear process, not at all conducive to the intuitive, leaping-here-and-there kind of thought human beings are good at.</p>

Computer text looks like typewriter text because it was influenced by the same (very powerful) force: linearity is easier to implement mechanically.</p>
<p>With that in mind, while Wordstar's block marking thing sounds cool, it sounds like a far cry from anything I would say resembles a long-hand page. I guess it doesn't take much when the competition is barely trying.</p>

<p>Yeah. I‚Äôve been reading a WordStar manual to see if there is more to it than that, but I‚Äôm not too far yet. So far, sounds a lot like a good text editor, but it‚Äôs hard to be fair from 40 years apart. </p>

<p>One thing I‚Äôd like point out in Sawyer‚Äôs discussion is that WordStar has one of the best attributes any piece of software can have: it rewards mastery.

I use comments and outlines in gdocs to do the kind of thing they talk about and it works for me. Comments that don't show for others is a cool idea but also not exactly emulating traditional longhand (unless you use invisible ink?) And I'm pretty sure you can share a doc without comments, too, or just export to PDF.</p>
<p>I've never heard of or had experience with WordStar but I guess I feel modern tools are adaptable enough to cover these use cases. You might not feel your workflow is as privileged in the software, though, which I know matters.</p>

<blockquote><p> WordStar has one of the best attributes any piece of software can have: it rewards mastery. One can argue that the keyboard shortcuts are harder to discover than, say, drop down menus actuated with a mouse, but once they‚Äôre in your hands you can move faster than in any mouse-y interface.</p>

<p>This seems to be surprisingly hard to do with modern software. Part of it is variety: I have a  <em>lot</em>  of word processors I have immediate access to, and so I haven't mastered any of them. (Nor, I suspect, do they reward master much.)</p>
<p>I wonder, though, how much also has to do with our cognitive capacity. Modern software may have the same features, but unless I can get the features "in my hands" (mouse or keyboard or whatever I don't care, but it does need to be able to be muscle memory) the features may be about as  <em>distracting</em>  from creative thought as they are  <em>enabling</em> .</p>

Imagine: I could work on my text right in the university library, with all sources at hand! There was a learning curve to WordStar, but after a week I was as efficient as I ever was later with whatever other software.</p>
<p>Today, my main writing tools is Emacs. Its org-mode has a rich choice of informal markup, i.e. markup that is not interpreted by Emacs itself but still relatively easy to process semi-automatically via keyboard macros. That's great for the use cases described in this article. The tough part is being consistent in my own use of this markup. One day I'll write a linter - one day.</p>

<p>Good point.  Continuous deployment is detrimental to UX.</p>

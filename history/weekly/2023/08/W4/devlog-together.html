I started by recording myself 'reading them out loud' a few months ago. And it's stuck, and I have no plans of stopping, and they're including more-and-more ad-libbing, so I've decided to make it official. So... now I'm doing the weekly 'TODEPOND PONDCAST'. Mostly as a bonus for supporters, but the occasional public one, <a href="https://todepond.substack.com/p/todepond-pondcast-todepond-times">like this one</a>.</p>
<p>I'd highly recommend recording yourself speaking your blog/posts/devlogs! It's been a nice way of connecting on a more personal level with readers.</p>

A tree of trees. Chess-style variation tree navigator, where each node represents a search step and shows the search tree and bindings at that time, plus where the new unification clause was found in the source code. Anyone ever seen a logic debugger like that?</p>

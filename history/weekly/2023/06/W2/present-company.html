It seems that most implementations for Figma, Google Workspace, and Microsoft Office 365 are pretty basic, but maybe that‚Äôs all people expect, so it‚Äôs not worth the effort to try to be clever. What do others think? I‚Äôd be pretty curious for people to suggest products which were able to ‚Äúdouble count‚Äù the typical ‚Äúsnapshot‚Äù UX by thoughtfully pairing it with another need like audit-ability. For example: Procreate has a way to see the timelapse of changes to a piece of art over time. Or, you could use snapshots as a way to tell a story with data, by selecting interesting snapshots to be used as ‚Äúkey frames‚Äù in a presentation.</p>

The trail interface, while also amazing in VisionPro/VR, allows for a quick intuitive sense of the sheet's evolution through time, space, collaborators, and sections. Combine with LLM's or other to write telescopic text summaries of changes. Non-linear timescale to have it based both on time and change density (cognitive wise, not necessarily data-wise); ability to affect this parameter along with the space-between change-regions to create clearer clusters of editing sessions, or parameter for conceptual/spacial regions, to separate edit history, recursively, into more specific areas of interest. (eg. if code, how has this functionality changed? keeping it in center while files surrounding content may move around it, while its origin story unfolds as it splits and merges across locations (+ utilizing data flow/dependency graph, to bring surrounding functionality ctx in the periphery.</p>

In my application, ‚Äúmultidimensional data‚Äù is basically just like rows in a typical database, where each column in the database is a ‚Äúdimension‚Äù. A key difference is that ‚Äúdimensions‚Äù can be re-used in multiple tables and used for joining and comparing across datasets.</p>
<p>The primary function I hope to use snapshots for is not data-entry, though. It‚Äôs ‚Äúdata modeling‚Äù and experimentation. E.g. Setting up data visualizations and control knobs on a canvas interface. So, if someone accidentally deletes a canvas of control knobs and visualizations, that canvas can be restored from a week ago through browsing this ‚Äúsnapshot history‚Äù</p>

<ul><li>The initial experience is a blank screen without bullets. I thought the outliner view was the #1 selling point of such tools? Do people use Obsidian to write free-form text?</li><li>I can copy a set of nested bullets from Obsidian to LogSeq and it works great. In the other direction, though, Obsidian loses all the nested structure I copied from LogSeq.</li></ul><p>Overall the experience has been surprising. The open source clone felt like a more polished onboarding experience than the relatively proprietary and centrally coordinated product. I'm curious if that matches other people's experience.</p>

<p>I see the value of being assumptive/shaping a specific kinda use‚Ä¶but I think you then need to guide folks to help them find that optimal way and Obsidian doesn‚Äôt really do that work at all, I don‚Äôt think.</p>

<p>My typical reply to these sorts of things is a flat "No" or simply the ol'  <em>Report Spam</em> , but‚Ä¶ this is GDC. So there are some people here who might actually be interested.</p>
<p>So instead I replied "none of those [forms of promotion] would work", and they just sent me the codes anyway.</p>
<p>Yes, mentioning it here means they are getting a bit of promotion they otherwise wouldn't get. But if anyone is actually interested in "attending" this virtual event, I figure it's worth saving them $150.</p>

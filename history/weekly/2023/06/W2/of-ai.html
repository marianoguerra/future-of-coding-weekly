<p>I think we‚Äôre discovering that our language has become a massive, global, flexing and morphing neural net itself. It encodes context, history, meaning. We‚Äôre slowly discovering that over the course of a few thousand years, humans have encoded into their language and symbolic representations the very data itself it‚Äôs describing.</p>
<p>The fact that science is coming out so easily in these LLMs doesn‚Äôt surprise it, but it‚Äôs beautiful nonetheless. Our scientific discourse is by itself consistently self referential, and both accepts and rejects itself with additional language. Papers that are cited heavily and appear more often in token inference are a ‚Äòcore‚Äô of that token-space.</p>
<p>None of this is surprising again. We wrote dictionaries wherein all the words point to each other. An encyclopedia is a dictionary with ordering.</p>
<p>An LLM is an encyclopedia with statistic relationships.</p>
<p>IMO.</p>

<ul><li>Initially, there were 3 people on the blue bus.</li><li>The yellow school bus had 5 children and the mom with her boy.</li></ul><p>However, it is unclear whether the mom and her boy stayed on the school bus or transferred to the blue bus. The given information suggests that the mom ran to catch the blue bus, implying she might have left the school bus. So, we can conclude that there are:</p>
<ul><li>3 people on the blue bus.</li><li>5 children on the yellow school bus.</li></ul><p>As for the total number of people involved, we have accounted for 3 people on the blue bus and 5 children on the yellow school bus.

Based on the clarification you provided, here's the revised breakdown:</p>
<ul><li>Initially, there were 3 people on the blue bus (excluding the driver).</li><li>The yellow school bus had 5 children (excluding the driver) and the mom with her boy.</li><li>The mom dropped off her boy on the yellow school bus and then boarded the blue bus.</li><li>Assuming each bus has one driver, we need to include them as well.</li></ul><p>So, after the mom boarded the blue bus:</p>
<ul><li>Blue Bus: 3 people (initially) + 1 mom + 1 driver = 5 people.</li><li>Yellow School Bus: 5 children + 1 mom (who dropped off her boy) + 1 driver = 7 people.</li></ul><p>Therefore, there are 5 people on the blue bus and 7 people on the yellow school bus in the end.</p>

<p>That's ~500k lines of code or ~5k files, enough to fully cover most repositories.</p>
<p>LTM-1 is a prototype of a neural network architecture we designed for giant context windows.</p>

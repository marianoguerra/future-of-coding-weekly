In the companies I've been at, there's been paper cuts and requests that engineers make to the product, which are time-consuming, tedious and take away from actual product/infra development.</p>
<p>If there are guardrails that Engineers define on certain parts of the product, are there any problems to this idea?  Curious what others think and/or have seen</p>

<p>I build tools for non-technical artists, who use these tools to do programming-like tasks and ship their work straight to prod. I've built these tools to give the artists plenty of rope to hang themselves (and our customers) with, but also the adequate context, training, documentation, and features to make it so that the benefits vastly outweigh the risks and occasional mishaps. (And I, the senior programmer, also occasionally ship something that has avoidable bugs. My programming ability doesn't save me from being fallible, heh)</p>

Like, if you have an apartment rental site, does adding/removing apartments qualify as a change? I suppose not a very interesting one at least, and it's something that has basically been solved. How about defining the sorting logic in search results? Changing visual styles? UI layout? Adding new data field to apartments.. Many of these have specific challenges and solutions when it comes to non-coders making changes. As a whole this question is basically about low/no-code solutions and the current industry approach is to have domain specific solutions as a generic one would start to resemble a general purpose programming language..</p>
<p>But <strong>@Sophia Deng</strong> I'm curious, what kind of changes would you expect Product Managers wanting to make?</p>

<p> <em>A problem I'm currently facing:</em>  I share a lot of links. I have a channel on my Slack workspace called #walkers-claptrap where I share anything / everything that I find noteworthy. It's a bit like <strong>#linking-together</strong>. That said, not everyone I share bookmarks with (and short remarks about them) are at work, so I'm frequently duplicating and sharing over multiple lines of communication (texting, social media, slack, etc). Even then, those channels aren't easily traversed and are organized linearly. I don't love sorting things by date when their value isn't directly scoped to time. I'd also prefer to publish some place that I own and syndicate elsewhere, so that rules out Twitter.</p>
<p> <em>semi-solution:</em> The claptrap specification. A graph of links / small notes. The edges are based on relationships or membership with some group. A claptrap MUST be hosted plaintext and MAY be accessed with curl or similar tool (sort of like Carmack's .plan files). A claptrap MAY expose an RSS of updates to syndicate to channels etc. A claptrap MAY reference external claptrap nodes to network / branch beyond the local graph.</p>
<p>Still very much a work in progress. Does anyone have a similar problem; do you have a solution you like? I want to bridge the gap between "personal knowledge base" and "sharing links into the ether"</p>

Big push toward bi-drectionality between code and blocks. For integration with existing code-bases, AI generation, collaboration with people not using visual editors, etc. At least two different approaches being investigated or used, and I would be inclined to use a completely different one. They don't realize it, but some of their problems are solved by some of the tools people here are working on. Like how do you make it so that you can generate blocks when the text is in an invalid state? Much easier to just avoid invalid states, like Blockly does! How can you avoid invalid states if the person isn't finished typing, and there are mandatory subnodes in the AST? Much easier to fill holes by default, like Blockly does. Essentially, they can't get to bidirectionality, because the text editing experience is structurally unaware. It's not possible with VSCode, but it is possible with Tylr, or anything that imposes a structure. Even ProseMirror would work better. But there is no need to stop at two concrete syntaxes, if you can sacrifice interface specific details (e.g. whitespace in text, grid position in Blockly), or keep them where they live (linter settings, a database of block locations outside the AST), you can operate directly on the AST in whatever tool you want. Has anyone played with a "headless" AST that could be used that way? It feels like all structural editors need one, particularly if they hope to facilitate collaborative editing. Has anyone tried putting two different coding interfaces over the same shared AST?</p>

Does that strike anyone else as WILDLY silly? The other approach I saw was adding the additional content relevant for the block language (e.g. X&amp;y coordinates) as comments, and writing a JavaScript AST to Blockly XML transpiler. More reasonable, but limited to those two specific syntaxes, which seems short-sighted, and there are things that you can change in the text that will not survive round trips, which seems like a usability problem. Their use case was only to let AI write code, though, so that doesn't matter to them.</p>

It is easy to go from a language that has more semantic content to a language that has less semantic content.  But, it is difficult to go from a language that has less semantic content to a language that has more semantic content. Semantic content comes in forms other than sequences of characters (or sequences of vector graphics), e.g. structure and layout mean something to human readers.  Going from Haskell to assembler makes sense, but, going from assembler to Haskell does not make sense.  Likewise, if the VPL is any good, then going from VPL to code is easy, but going from code to VPL is difficult.  N.B. if code-&gt;VPL were easy, it would imply that that the VPL adds no new information and is, therefore, redundant.  A decent VPL should contain semantic meaning that is difficult to express in code.  Hence, IMO, it makes no sense to even try to “round trip” code-&gt;VPL.</p>
<p>For an example in a very different field - math - we are taught that we can multiply matrices, but, that we cannot divide matrices.  Robert Distinti has developed a way to divide matrices and blames previous failure to do so on the fact that too much information is discarded by current methods.</p>
<p>Aside: Note that, to me, a VPL is a hybrid of graphics and text (see SVG, for example).  There is/was a field called “Design Recovery” that researched possible approaches to recovering semantic information (I witnessed such techniques being used for fixing Y2K problems, which would have been lessened if they had kept the source code and would not have equated “dates” with girls’ names in some of the code).</p>

Also my "projectional language workbench" generates a "headless" "AST editor engine" which can then be used, as you said, anyway you like. It exposes both the linearized version (for textual projections) and the tree structure (for visual projections). Currently I've only been working on the textual projection (which is a lot harder issue), but adding a 'blocky' projection should be just about writing the UI code. To read and write actual text files to and from the AST, a parser and an unparser should be implemented. Certainly possible but there's extra challenge in keeping the whitespaces when parsing and only writing minimal changes when unparsing. When parsing, the whitespace info should be stored in the AST that is then modified by the projectional editor. Now, it would be quite a bit easier if you wouldn't care that reading a text file, doing a minimal change in the projectional editor and writing back to a text file might change formatting for the whole file.</p>

Probably there are also other hideous edge cases, the absolute worst intersection of naming things and cache invalidation; I'm sure the off-by-one errors are just waiting for their chance too. (I'm also thinking of this in the context of, say, bidirectional sync of documents in different formats).</p>

Block-based languages solve the problem by not allowing you to type. You must drag and drop valid syntax nodes and combine them. That's good, but the interface is unfamiliar for some people. Oracle Policy Automation allows you to type anything you want (in MS Word), and offers a search bar you can use to find valid syntax if you get messed up. It's more familiar, but very easy to make syntax errors. A structure aware XML editor would look and feel more like Word, giving non-programmers a familiar environment, but only allow you to type things that were syntactically correct. I'm imagining a sort of strict autocomplete. My particular use case is knowledge representation of statute and regulation, so my users are used to those things being expressed as documents.</p>

I think the viability of using XML editor for CNL depends on the details of the language and how structure aware the editor is. Some XML schema definition might be enough for simple language, but more complex languages are likely to require context sensitive syntax rules and even semantic understanding from the editor. I feel like you'll run into a hard ceiling at some point trying to define and enforce the structure with a schema. A language workbench able to produce textual projectional editor would probably be a safer bet.</p>

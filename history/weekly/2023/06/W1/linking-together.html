As a physicist and Tai-Chi practitioner, I can confirm pretty much everything it says about physics and taoism. The analogies are well observed - what you make of them is up to you of course.</p>
<p>I had a math professor at university who held a lecture every year drawing similar analogies between the creation story of the bible and the scientific story of the formation of the Earth and its biosphere. He observed in particular that the order of appearance of everything was the same.</p>
<p>Personally I find Capra's analogies more interesting than those of my math professor, but then, that's mostly a matter of personal appreciation.</p>

<p>Someone who comes to  <em>Dao of Physics</em>  with a background in physics, epistemology of science, and Daoism will understand exactly what Capra means, but find nothing new, whereas those who read it  <em>without</em>  that background usually internalize a bad hippy/woo interpretation of the contents.</p>

<p>I've read descriptions of their concerns about not wanting a reduced and misunderstood version of their ideas to take root in the wider culture, as happened with the Xerox PARC research.</p>
<p>I would argue that the reason a reduced and misunderstood version of the PARC research took root in the popular culture was because most people were not exposed to the real thing. They were exposed to Apple's and Microsoft's crappy copy of a superficial understanding of the surface appearance of the PARC research.</p>
<p>By keeping Dynamicland so proprietary and under wraps, I fear that Victor is probably going to end up recreating this same tragedy, when someone who watches the video demos creates a crappy copy of a superficial understanding of the surface appearance of the Dynamicland research, and that crappy copy takes root in the popular culture.</p>

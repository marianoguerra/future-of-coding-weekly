<p>I wrote a small (&lt;500 lines of code) BASIC to JS compiler, that lets me run the programs from the class book <em>101 BASIC Computer Games</em> from 1978. It's interesting for two reasons I think: 1. for those who want to learn about languages and compilers, this provides a very simple example 2. philosophically, I think BASIC really exemplifies the Worse is Better approach outlined by  Richard Gabriel and covered in a FOC podcast. It is a terrible language in many ways, but it was small enough to be stored in a 4k ROM and be used to to useful things on an early microcomputer with only 4k of RAM. If we had waited for machines with enough memory to run Lisp, Smalltalk or Algol, the microcomputer revolution would have been delayed by a decade or more.

<p>By my personal tastes, the best language for early microcomputers would have been Forth. It was around by then, but maybe not known widely enough. Or maybe someone decided it was too weird for ordinary people. There was one home computer model based on Forth (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_Ace">Jupiter Ace</a>), which was not much of a commercial success, but it also appeared too late - BASIC was already everywhere.</p>

I'm a big fan of FORTH, having used it a lot in the 80's and am even writing a lexically-scoped OO FORTH-like system: <a href="https://github.com/kgrgreer/TURTLES/tree/main">github.com/kgrgreer/TURTLES/tree/main</a> .  Also, some early microcomputers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCM/70">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCM/70</a>) used APL, but neither APL nor FORTH were as accessible as BASIC. LOGO, which is a simplified dialect of LISP, and actually a pretty good language, might have been a better choice. But people looked down on it because of its use with Turtle graphics and being for kids, but it is actually a much better language than BASIC (or just about anything else at the time).</p>

This is because you would need to save much more frequently with FORTH because it wasn't memory safe and running your program could crash your machine and lose your changes. BASIC, on the other hand, would just give something like a 'SYNTAX ERROR: line 20', and nothing would be lost. With BASIC, you could program for hours and just save once at the end, which is something you couldn't do with FORTH. This effectively raised the price of a minimally viable machine.</p>

<p>Apart from memory safety (with the concept really not even surfacing), BASIC also has some advantages in being very straightforward and linear, rather than hierarchical. Which is not just easy to understand. but actually also a close analogue to how the CPU executes instructions, at least conceptually.</p>
<p>That also enables a very direct transition from immediate mode execution to stored program:  just add a line number in front.</p>

My solution was printing the code, with subroutines on separate pages, starting with a comment that gave a name to the subroutine. Each  <code>gosub</code>  also had a comment with the name of the subroutine being called.</p>

<p>I make <a href="http://lintrule.com">lintrule.com</a>, a little CLI for having a language model do your code review.</p>
<p>You write rules in plain text, and then it checks them against your code, like a test framework. Here‚Äôs an example rule that runs on SQL migrations:</p>
<h2>```</h2><p>include: ["migrations/*.sql"]</p>
<hr><p>Make sure our postgres migrations follow these rules:</p>
<ol start="1"><li><p>ensure new tables are at least 3NF (third normal form). If they're not, fail and give an example of what's wrong, assuming the reader does not know terms like "BNCF", "3NF", "BCNF", and so on.</p>
</li><li><p>make sure that all tables have a created_at and updated_at</p>
</li><li><p>make sure migrations don't have breaking changes. For example, removing a table, removing column, and so on.</p>
<p>3.1 It's okay to have a breaking change if there's a comment on the migration that explains why it's safe to have that change.</p>
</li><li><p>prefer 'uuid' over 'serial' or 'int' for primary keys. Ignore this check if it's primary key made up of two columns.
```</p>

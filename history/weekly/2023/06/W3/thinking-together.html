I‚Äôm curious what connotations that invokes for folks here and what features you might imagine a futuristic, ‚Äúfull-stack‚Äù database would have?

<p>Two things that come to mind:</p>
<ul><li>Designed to be used by all front-end, back-end, and edge applications. A cross between firebase and postgres, if you will. In many ways DynamoDB feels like an interesting abstraction: NoSQL built on a MySQL backend. So my S1 when I hear "full stack" is a realtime nosql abstraction built on a strictly relational db (with an escape hatch to access the latter).</li><li>A DB with bundled, native ORM that speaks wire protocol. Most ORMs I see are built as an afterthought. "Full-stack" evokes notions of accessibility from a language API perspective. This point is more of a personal feel and not a practical concern though</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2023-06-13T16:57:58.454Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Walker Griggs</span> <a href="./?fromDate=2023-06-10&amp;toDate=2023-06-16&amp;channel=thinking-together&amp;filter=#2023-06-13T16:57:58.454Z" class="date">2023-06-13 16:57:58</a> <div class="message"><p>Bonus: I often see a micro-service deployed to translate between the business logic and the DB layers. That service often ends up being "endpoints on a stick" with a side of "validation and authentication"</p>
<p>A "full-stack" db in my mind would alleviate the need for such a service. Whether that means exposing http endpoints and natively translating to the query language or omitting the query sql language layer all together and  <em>exclusively</em>  bundling the ORM + query language + wire protocol, I'm not sure.</p>
<p>Your question is bringing a few thoughts on accessibility to the surface and I'm brain dumping</p>

Our model files are the equivalent of a database schema, but contain a lot more information.

Yes, it looks similar, as do many other ORM and middleware systems, but the difference is that FOAM is much wider, in that it spans all the way from the back-end of the back-end to the front-end of the front-end, so spans several languages in the process. This also helps to avoid a lot of the glue code generally needed to create a complete system.</p>

<p>I completely agree here. This is maybe what I was getting out with "a full-stack db in my mind would alleviate the need for such a service [db layer logic translation]".  Databases tend to be at the center of our systems and, for the most part, services are organized according to their data access patterns. It seems absolutely reasonable to me that a "full stack" DB would handle and centralize core business logic without the need for each consuming service to duplicate logic.</p>

Here's my initial Q. It feels to me like this involves setting out data governance policies that say things akin to "don't give access to personally identifying information unless the user has admin privileges", and then what happens is that the people running the software need to configure their tools to comply with that rule. That feels like it would a) make it more complicated to add new tools, driving organizations to centralize, and b) be difficult for the people writing the policy, who presumably don't know the software tools, to confirm has been implemented correctly. I'm presuming that they do some form of user testing to see if they can find violations, but they don't validate the configurations directly, and there is nothing in the way of real-time or near-real-time auditing. Is that more or less how it goes? Or is the tooling more sophisticated than that?</p>

<p>The distinction between governance and what I‚Äôll call ‚Äúprogrammatic gate keeping‚Äù is often times 2 overlapping circles. Defining what needs to be enforced ‚Äúwhere‚Äù can help. </p>
<p>In your example of access rules: don‚Äôt bother to include ‚Äúgovernance‚Äù level guidance about that. As you say it can be nuanced and complicated. Enforce access rules in code if at all possible, and make the governance about how to use the right and good code pathway. E.g. ‚Äúwe‚Äôve got oauth set up. You must use it.‚Äù </p>
<p>Here governance and code world are combined, and become stronger and (ideally) self supporting. </p>

<p>Where it gets tricky is when you‚Äôve got stuff that needs ‚Äúgovernance‚Äù that can‚Äôt be enforced in code, or codified into a CI/CD pipeline for some reason. For me, the canonical example of this is the focus of my job ‚Äî accessibility. </p>
<p>There are accessibility auditing tools that can run automatic scans as part of a build and deploy pipeline, but they‚Äôre not really all that good.

<p>Guidance, in my meaning here, is the worst kind of (read perhaps as ‚Äúmost difficult to verify?‚Äù) governance because it relates to code practices that are critical but potentially reliant on individual implementations and are difficult to verify‚Ä¶</p>

The thing that the tool I am working on offers is an easier and more verifiable symmetry between written rules and their encoded equivalent. That tends to be most useful when following the rules is very important, but the requirements and text of the rule are not under your control, and the rules are complicated, and demonstrating adherence to them in automated systems is important. In data governance, with the exception of things like GDPR, you usually have control over the rules. If they are hard to implement, you can rewrite them. So I'm curious whether there is a pain point in data governance around automating and demonstrating compliance with written rules,  <em>in the terms of those written rules</em> . For instance, if it was possible to run something in CI/CD that would take test inputs and outputs, detect data policy violations, and flag them  <em>with a link to the written policy they violate</em> ... is that anything? Does that make anyone's life better? Or is that like a hat on a hat?</p>

<p>Cynically, I think it is something because it is an element that can be automated, and plugged into an existing system. In my experience, folks want people out, and CI/CD automation in ‚Äî automat as much stuff as possible, no matter the implications of what it means for the system.</p>

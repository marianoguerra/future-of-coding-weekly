But I'm not sure it's far to say that the thing Bret was demoing is what has been productized here.  <em>See where a character's jump will land</em>  is but one of the many kinds of debug visualization that have always been ubiquitous in game dev, and Mario Maker is quite literally just  <em>game dev as a product</em> . Pretty much every platformer game will have dev tooling to help visually quantify whether or not the player can readily make a given jump. And yes, some of them do it with an onion-skin effect, like Bret and Mario Maker 2, because that's a classic visualization technique when working with frame-based animation. (Eg: Flash had it built-in to the editor.) Here's <a href="https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0005">another</a> example of visualization to debug character movement.</p>
<p>But the more general point Bret was trying to make with this example ‚Äî that you should have an immediate preview of what your code is doing, and you should be able to abstract that preview across a range of system configurations (see also <a href="http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/">Ladder of Abstraction</a>, of course) ‚Äî is not  <em>quite</em> what this particular feature in game dev tools achieves. For instance, I'm not sure how common it is for games to have the sort of deterministic time-travel bret was playing with. Rather, they tend to just forward-project from a chosen starting configuration. That's why the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72y2EC5fkcE">Tomorrow Corp Tech Demo</a> was so impressive. The deeper interpretation of Bret's stuff is still on the fringes.</p>

<p>The limited forward projection of jumps etc is quite common and you see it with grenade projection markers etc in game</p>

Even things like colouring models based on their internal AI or pathfinding state. This type of thing comes easily because you have a canvas right there to output to, it's actually much easier than print debugging. If every computer program came with a canvas you would see this type of thing for abstract business logic programs as well.</p>

<p>To give some scope:</p>
<blockquote><p>In asking ‚ÄúWhat is live coding?,‚Äù our intention is not to fix or define but rather to explore how live coding  <em>opens up</em> . Live coding is about people interacting with the world, and each other, in real time, via code. Live coding is about making software  <em>live</em> .</p>
<p>The first part is more practice focused, offering an account of the origins, development, and aspirations associated with the evolution of live coding alongside presenting documentation and examples of live coding practice. The second part is more speculative and conceptual in its register, allowing space for discussion of the many ways live coding reflects and informs wider cultural and political concerns.</p>

<p>From the little bits and pieces I've been able to find, DynamicLand seems to pick up the design threads from his early Smalltalk-71 designs (small objects using pattern-matching of goals), while incorporating some newer ideas (wishes/claims, ie publish/subscribe of goals, a spreadsheet like reactive nature)</p>

</div> <div class="attachments"><blockquote><p>[June 4th, 2023 9:26 PM] ivanreese: Addendum to the above, &lt;<a href="https://dynamicland.org/docs/2023-04-27-Communal-computing-for-21st-century-science.pdf|this">https://dynamicland.org/docs/2023-04-27-Communal-computing-for-21st-century-science.pdf|this</a> PDF&gt; on the Dynamicland site. Starts with a bang.</p>
<p>&amp;gt; Nobody asked for the invention of the graphical user interface. It wasnâ€™t on any national research agenda. There was no demand from users â€” they were a small cadre of professionals using computing for specialized technical tasks, and accepted command-driven textual interfaces as simply what it meant to use a computer. There was no demand from the public â€” most people never expected to touch a computer in their lives.
&amp;gt; The concepts around directly manipulating information arranged spatially on a screen were invented unbidden by a small group of visionaries, particularly in the research groups of Doug Engelbart and Alan Kay in the 1960s and 1970s. They believed that computing could be more than just number crunching, that it could serve as a medium for all people to see and discuss ideas, if only those ideas could be represented in visible, manipulable forms.
I haven't read the rest of the PDF yet, but it looks to go into a fair bit more detail about their vision for the "21st Century Science Lab" than what was hinted at in the video.</p>

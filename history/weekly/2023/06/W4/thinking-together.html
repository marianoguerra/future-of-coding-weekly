<p>React lets ya build accessible, localized experiences, but it also lets ya make something that is wholly inaccessible, too. It is sort of agnostic on that front. Could a tool ‚Äúforce‚Äù an accessible experience, or be more strongly biased towards something like that?</p>
<p>This line of thinking isn‚Äôt restricted to accessibility, it just seemed like an easy fruit to reach for when writing an example. Is this the kinda thing other folks think about when designing stuff? Do you have examples of it?</p>

We have a reusable CRUD controller which provides things like search, sorting, import, export, scrolling, paging, authentication, i18n, etc. Developers can use the the individual components, like table view, detail view, query parser, DAO, etc., to make their own controller, but by just doing nothing they get a more standard interaction. Same for generated APIs. Often when you make some standard interaction very easy though, you'll find that users complain that other things are hard, even if they aren't any harder than without your tool, just relative to the things you make easier.</p>

<p>she's currently using it in the context of: We want developers to write "validators" for the custom shapes they build (for tldraw). But validators can feel boring and pointless! How do we get them to write validators without thinking about it much? Current answer: "No no, you're not  <em>writing a validator</em> , you're...  <em>defining your shape"</em> </p>

So doing the ‚Äúright thing‚Äù becomes the pragmatic choice, and not just principled.</p>
<p>There are many examples of this in data visualization tools and libraries, like vega-lite. For example, you could use a single hue or multi hue color encoding depending on whether color represents a discrete category (like country), or a binned quantitative variable (like temp in range 10-20 degrees). Psych and design heuristics suggest that one of these is more effective, so if you don‚Äôt specify a palette, a reasonable selection is made for you. You can override it if someone has a strong visual preference, but it‚Äôll be more work, so most don‚Äôt bother.</p>

Much like you can't let a language both be able to generate arbitrary assembly and also be safe, if you try too hard to make your UI framework generate accessible UIs, it will rule out tons of possible UIs, some of which even might have been fine a11y-wise. I tend to lean more towards power, but we'll need a spectrum of different tools forever. Best case the more restrictive ones are built on the more powerful ones in a principled way so it's not too awful if you need to break out.</p>
<p>More specific to a11y, the architecture I'd like to see is that we support completely reskinning our apps, so basically our data models and operations, with UIs designed from the ground up for vision impairment, mobility issues, etc, with their own idioms not tied down to standard GUI stuff. Retrofitting accessibility on a fundamentally visual medium is always going to be kinda meh at best. But you need that common model before this becomes, frankly, commercially feasible.</p>

If the View isn't the app, just the View, and the underlying data and operations are in the Model, then you can have multiple kinds of views, possibility at the same time. Just like the classic MVC example where data (from the Model) appears in both a grid and a pie chart (2 Views) at the same time. A model can have a standard GUI View but also a separate text-to-speech UI. We did this with the ChromeOS system calculator by having a separate CalcSpeechView which was invisible from the traditional GUI point of view, but worked with screen readers to provide speech output: <a href="https://github.com/foam-framework/foam/blob/2966cde661ccadbb8b1548fede78f6d67cc53ed5/js/foam/apps/calc/CalcSpeechView.js">github.com/foam-framework/foam/blob/2966cde661ccadbb8b1548fede78f6d67cc53ed5/js/foam/apps/calc/CalcSpeechView.js</a></p>

<p>It‚Äôs about Content Centric Networking but I find it interesting because he talks about about how perspectives that change the frame of discussion (unspoken assumptions etc) can be powerful. The example he talks about first is going from circuit switching to packet switching. Packet switching did indeed ‚Äúwin‚Äù even though everyone was at one point trying to make circuit switching fast.</p>
<p>I think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_centric_networking">CCN </a>didn‚Äôt catch on with any open standard the same way as packet switching. However it seems <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">CDNs</a> also use principles similar to ‚Äúnamed data‚Äù?

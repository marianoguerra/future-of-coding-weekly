Progress on my big project, a collaborative mobile-friendly development environment, has been very slow. However, along the way I've built some libraries which may be of interest to some people here.</p>
<p>On the languages and parsing side, I've built <a href="https://github.com/jhp/recursive-grammar-literal">recursive grammar literals</a> which lets you write CFGs as normal javascript functions. And <a href="https://github.com/jhp/church-cat">church-cat</a> which lets you compute over a tree structure, e.g. annotate a parse tree.</p>
<p>On the UI side I've built <a href="https://github.com/jhp/imperative">imperative</a> which is a frontend javascript library much like React, but based on generators and structured concurrency. And most recently I've been working on <a href="https://github.com/jhp/palimpsest">Palimpsest</a> which covers the backend of web development with a more functional or "event-sourced" style where data sources are computed as folds over input streams. My interest there is to allow stateful applications to be more easily shared, forked, and extended by their users etc.</p>

Large companies are sucking up all the oxygen and building overcomplicated software.</p>
<p>What you're going for with wigwams seems to have a lot of overlap with the stated ideals of the open source movement, so I think it would be helpful to think about why that movement has failed and how yours can differentiate itself. Won't people in your directory want to make money? Isn't the best way to make money with a small, user-friendly project by using it as marketing or a trojan horse to get people into a big, user-hostile ecosystem?</p>

<p>I’m almost “done” with my VR visual/spatial programming app, Pebble Graphics 🎉 (“done” because I still see a lot of things that could be improved, but there are other projects I’m excited to start so I’m shipping what I have). It’s a VR version of turtle graphics with some interactive program stepping and 3D visualizations of things like state change and execution history.</p>
<p>I made a trailer you can watch (and listen to 🎶) here <a href="https://youtu.be/Fl3DjzTdUo8?si=bWi7CWwbXIQh_wUw">youtu.be/Fl3DjzTdUo8?si=bWi7CWwbXIQh_wUw</a>. If you have a Quest headset and want to try it out, I set up a Beta release while I try to get it into Meta’s App Lab app store. This link <a href="https://www.meta.com/s/2Rlda8ess">meta.com/s/2Rlda8ess</a> should work otherwise feel free to DM me the email address associated with your Oculus/Meta account.</p>
<p>I also have some time-stamped/annotated videos later on in this Youtube Playlist (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhmEEtPzG7mW4JrBUhwbo3al6HjaJsDp2">youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhmEEtPzG7mW4JrBUhwbo3al6HjaJsDp2</a> ) in case you want to see more.</p>
<p>I’m more of a lurker in this slack, but it’s a community I enjoy checking on and it’s really cool to see it grow!</p>

<p>Pebble Graphics is a 3D visual and interactive programming system that lets you create and explore geometric patterns in virtual reality. Using simple commands, you can control Pebbles the dog to draw lines and shapes with programming. You can also step through your programs interactively, and see unique 3D visualizations of how things change over time. Pebble Graphics is a fun and creative way to learn basic ideas in programming.</p>

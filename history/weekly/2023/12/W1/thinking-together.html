There is a basic plugin for copilot but nothing more from what I know. I guess seeing something like Copilot X in Emacs would be cool. I think it might be due to power-users of Emacs possibly being a bit more old school, and maybe even a bit in opposition to the changes that LLMs are bringing? Might be also that, if userbase is more experienced engineers, they are just waiting for the whole space to stabilise more.</p>

<p>Going to be a while before people are building projects with it haha. For the foreseeable future, it's likely going to sit somewhere between zsh and wolfram language. And then hopefully something like flash/geocities üôÇ I'll try to put out frequent demos once it's usable</p>

<p>Yes! Both projects are functional languages that use content addressability. Main difference is goals:</p>
<ul><li>unison focuses on building software with novel team collaboration and distributed systems</li><li>scrapscript focuses on being a good global package manager and messaging format... that also might be a good general-purpose programming language one day haha</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2023-11-29T12:32:44.435Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Miles Sabin</span> <a href="./?fromDate=2023-11-26&amp;toDate=2023-12-02&amp;channel=thinking-together&amp;filter=#2023-11-29T12:32:44.435Z" class="date">2023-11-29 12:32:44</a> <div class="message"><p>Could you imagine writing something similar-ish to scrapscript as a Unison library?</p>

<p>Scrapscript is storage-agnostic, so theoretically somebody could host a scrapyard on top of ipfs, filecoin, whatever. But I don't want to bite off too much at once, so I think we should start with a simple centralized kv store</p>
<p>I've also tried to make it namespace agnostic, so theoretically, you should be able to use ipns for scrapnames too! There are a few more tricky bits there, but the concept definitely works.</p>

<p>If Scrapscript does networking, you can implement the IMAP protocol. If Scrapscript can read local files, you can delegate IMAP to an external tool such as isync. In both cases you need a MIME parser. Just like with any other programming languages.</p>
<p>So in the end, my question comes down to whether Scrapscript has access to local files and to network protocols.</p>

It's declarative, describing a process that may never be initiated. When $start also feels like it should be implicit for anything that doesn't have a different trigger. The names could be more descriptive than lowercase letters. I might be inclined to use "when {name} happens" , and "step: {name} is" to make it clearer, too. But all that should be taken with a grain of salt, because I have never been able to understand why I would want to use BPMN. All my use cases seem deeply ill-suited to it.</p>

<p>BPMN has around 120 types of elements including exclusive gateways, parallel gateways which seems highly unnecessary. I'm trying to avoid all those elements with some kind of composable event algebra. I think workflow engines (where some tasks could be done by humans) have been underutilized by developers precisely because of BPMN's complexity.</p>

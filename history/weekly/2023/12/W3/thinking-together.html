Tables/lists in sheets represent collections of things, however formulas and drag-filling works at an item-level (cell-level) abstraction. This causes a lot of problems ‚Äì duplicated effort, hard to do lookups across tables, errors when new data is added. However, committing to a structure upfront (a SQL style table for example) has a big cost. An effective system would allow users to gradually introduce structure that works with whatever rich table they draw.</p>
<p>Right now I'm onto a language for pulling data from such rich tables. It works by manipulation of the ranges (rectangles) pointed to by Labels. Queries can be made by intersecting/unioning rectangles (in picture is a small example). What ideas/projects would you recommend looking at in this space? I've looked around a fair bit for "2D grammar" and "spatial programming language" but haven't had much luck.</p>

At the deep level, I find it best to keep track of functional/cardinality dependencies: a given employee has a name, age, salary; a team has multiple employees on it and an employee can be on multiple teams.  That way you can pay less attention to the exact organization of tables.  Instead focus on a richer grammar for views.

<p>In my work, I often have a compound key ‚Äîgiven a time, place, and person, you have a unique event of some sort ‚Äî and then it makes sense to talk about events, but you also want to pretty freely switch between places or people and still retain the context.</p>

<p>I think this does seem relevant to discussions about language features specifically meant to iterate over a range of numbers or the members of a collection, versus something more generic like the for loop in C.</p>
<p>One could argue that the distance between denotation and connotation is greater with a generic for loop than it is with a loop structure specifically meant to iterate over the members of a collection, and by reducing the difference between denotation and connotation you reduce the intellectual difficulty of reading the code, and you make it easier for the compiler to infer the programmer's intent for purposes of optimization.</p>

</div> <div class="attachments"><blockquote><p>üìù <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style">Indentation style</a></p>
<p>In computer programming, an indentation style is a convention governing the indentation of blocks of code to convey program structure. This article largely addresses the free-form languages, such as C and its descendants, but can be (and often is) applied to most other programming languages (especially those in the curly bracket family), where whitespace is otherwise insignificant. Indentation style is only one aspect of programming style.
Indentation is not a requirement of most programming languages, where it is used as secondary notation. Rather, indenting helps better convey the structure of a program to human readers. Especially, it is used to clarify the link between control flow constructs such as conditions or loops, and code contained within and outside of them. However, some languages (such as Python and occam) use indentation to determine the structure instead of using braces or keywords; this is termed the off-side rule. In such languages, indentation is meaningful to the compiler or interpreter; it is more than only a clarity or style issue.
This article uses the term brackets to refer to parentheses, and the term braces to refer to curly brackets.</p>

I‚Äôm still thinking about it.</p>
<p>I thought of a few mundane examples of when designers intentionally smuggled connotations into the language: ‚Äúfoo!‚Äù as syntax for  ~<em><em>unsafely</em></em>~  removing null from foo‚Äôs type, and ‚Äúfoo?.bar‚Äù for when we‚Äôre  ~<em><em>unsure</em></em>~  whether foo exists. These are good.</p>
<p>But man, I can‚Äôt think of instances as universally relatable as we have in prose. Like syntax for  ~<em><em>begrudgingly</em></em>~  implementing an interface, or  ~<em><em>timidly</em></em>~  asserting a precondition, or  ~<em><em>sarcastically</em></em>~  implementing a can‚Äôt-happen branch, or  ~<em><em>apologetically</em></em>~  throwing an exception. I can‚Äôt think of a way, without a comment, to tell a reader that the following code  ~<em><em>seems</em></em>~  to work but I‚Äôve only ever run it once so be careful. Put it in the top-level instead of packaging it up in a function? What about self-confident code?</p>
<p>Do I just have a huge blind spot for these things, though? I recently learned that TypeScript has two syntaxes for declaring object types. I use them both regularly, but I never spared a conscious thought for their concurrent existence. I would use one to evoke OCaml-ness and the other, Java-ness. Total autopilot. All vibes.</p>

Sometimes it's not even possible to recover the design from just the source code: <a href="https://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/01/the-design-of-software-is-thing-apart.html">pathsensitive.com/2018/01/the-design-of-software-is-thing-apart.html</a>.</p>
<p>But you can make your intentions clearer, and one way is through the connotations of your code. The programmatic structures and the variable names that you choose both communicate something about the design.</p>
<p>I believe most of the bugs that I've written in the past year happened because the design of a component changed and the implementation didn't.</p>
<p>At that point, the code may still "work" just fine in its current form (i.e., it returns the correct output for any input). But if so, it works by coincidence rather than by design.</p>
<p>Another way to say this is that the connotations of the code implicitly make promises about the behavior. And if those promises are no longer guaranteed by the design, it becomes very easy to create bugs by calling a function in a way that seems natural, but has unintended side effects.</p>

<p>I think this is a fascinating question, and also points to the phrase ‚Äúsemantics‚Äù being a wee bit overloaded in English, maybe? </p>
<p>Like, there is a semiotics to a program ‚Äî </p>

<p>With a program when do you start thinking about a it‚Äôs connotations? When it‚Äôs source in an editor? When it‚Äôs been compiled? When it‚Äôs been run?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>My first guess would be that they emerge from the frequent usage of a word or phrase in combination with some other word, phrase, or idea. When this happens often enough, the word or phrase evokes images or feelings associated with the other word, phrase, or idea.</p>

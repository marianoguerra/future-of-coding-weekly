<ul><li>Apps are units of behavior. They let you do new things.</li><li>They are units of namespacing.

<p>I do think that it is easy for folks dissatisfied with the limitations of apps to overlook the many powerful affordances they offer, though, and for computing aficionados to overestimate the degree to which regular users even

I think what most people in this space want to do is create an environment where it's /possible/ to tinker with your app, without having to download the source, edit it, recompile it, submit a patch, etc. Just like a lot of people in e.g. accounting will re-use Excel sheets templates made by other people (or their past selves), I imagine that a sufficiently advanced tool would let you make a "music notation" template (kinda like a DSL in the end) that people can use out of the box, but still tinker with if the need arises. Whether this is possible in a user-friendly way remains an open question IMO.</p>

(Dorico  <em>can</em>  be scripted, with Lua, but it isn‚Äôt a public/stable API yet.)</p>
<p>I think the question is whether this is actually viable:</p>
<blockquote><p>I imagine that a sufficiently advanced tool would let you make a ‚Äúmusic notation‚Äù template (kinda like a DSL in the end) that people can use out of the box, but still tinker with if the need arises.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The domain complexities in any area I have tackled personally  <em>or</em>  have just followed closely are just  <em>astonishingly</em>  deep. It took  <em>four years</em>  for the team that built Dorico to get it to its 1.0 release with what was basically a blank check from the parent company, Steinberg‚Ä¶ and it was probably the 3.0 release a couple years later before it was earnestly competitive with its major competitors. That‚Äôs the thing that makes me very ü§î about any proposed ‚Äúdocument-centric‚Äù model I have seen (as well as skeptical of general app skepticism). I notice, for example, that even in the Excel example, ‚Äúmuch more extensible‚Äù or even ‚Äúmuch more user-programmable‚Äù application ‚â† ‚Äúinverted model where applications are not primary but documents are‚Äù.</p>
<p>To me, then, the more interesting framing is not ‚Äúdocument-centric‚Äù but rather ‚Äúwhat would be the affordances of a host-environment that would make it easier for applications to surface embeddable components/elements/script hooks/etc.?‚Äù</p>

<p>...and an important detail that's elided here: the Dorico team wasn't starting from scratch building domain expertise. They had built the industry-leading notation package and were fired en masse. They started the blank page redesign as the leading experts in the field already. The workflow and mental model they developed with an opportunity to start over are different enough that it's difficult to interoperate either as a user or from a document/file format POV that it's hard to imagine it working in a document-centric world without a huge loss of fidelity (and it's interesting to me that Raskin specifically calls out music notation as a great use case for that vision)</p>

<p>I think it is important to pursue a positively formulated goal. "No apps" is a motivation, not a goal. You cannot move towards it.</p>
<p>I have settled on "computational media" as my goal. I see that as a space of directly manipulable data to which computations are attached - a bit like a spreadsheet or a word processor, but for more diverse types of data and computation. I have no generalist intentions in this endeavor: my domain is computational science.</p>
<p>Once you take the "computational media" perspective, all the points that <a href="http://akkartik.name/about">Kartik Agaram</a> became very real issues. Namespacing is the easiest one, because it's just a matter of conventions, possibly enforced by a very transparent framework. It's less obvious how you can let people add behavior to a computational document while maintaining the good features of apps.</p>
<p>Finally, a note on why I didn't choose the extremist perspective on "no apps": I actually like them for some purposes. There's a tensions between agency and convenience: the more agency you have over your computations, the more you need to engage with the technology, and that has a cost (in terms of effort). For many use cases, the convenience of apps is just fine with me. Weather apps? Great! E-mail apps? Horrible! For other people, it may be just the opposite of course.</p>

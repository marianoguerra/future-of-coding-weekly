<p><a href="https://akkartik.itch.io/carousel/devlog/651711/new-version-after-9-days">akkartik.itch.io/carousel/devlog/651711/new-version-after-9-days</a></p>
<p>One little detail here involves Android permissions. I almost ended up asking for microphone permissions in Lua Carousel. Luckily I managed to stop and ask myself what the user experience is. "Hi, I'm Lua Carousel, could I please have access to your mic?" Ick! It seems like a bad idea to ask for a permission for the whole app just in case some single script uses it. Probably affects the conversions from this particular blog post, but I don't want to feel like I'm contributing to the general fatigue over apps asking for permissions. 🤷</p>

<p>Google, Github, etc.: use your login with us to sign in to other services on the internet! No other passwords to remember!</p>
<p>Also Google, Github, etc.: oh btw, you're responsible for everything those services do with the permissions you grant.</p>
<p>Bottom line: signing in to a throwaway service using a valuable service can lose you access to the valuable service.</p>
<p>I think this is a pretty ironclad case against Oauth or any sort of delegated login.</p>

Testing backup/recovery scenarios is annoying and time consuming.</p>
<p>In general my prejudiced opinion here is that passkeys are another vector to keep us hooked on our big tech accounts. Which, I don't use anything Apple but I'd trust Apple with. But Google or something lesser like Github, forget about it. Just my opinion of course, as I'm trying to think about passkeys.</p>

<p>My site was just hand-written HTML, with a tiny build script so that I could start most pages with something like  <code>&lt;!-- import ../../header --&gt;</code> </p>
<p>Talking to Devine at StrangeLoop, they suggested using an iframe instead, and not having the build step at all. I find this really appealing.</p>

<p>Yeah — we've bonded over this idea before. Very fond of writing that is public but not linked from anywhere (I guess "unlisted" is the YouTube term for this). I believe Kevin Lynagh does this to good effect.</p>

<p>Next, I want to downsize the static site generator. I use <a href="https://github.com/coleslaw-org/coleslaw">Coleslaw</a>, which is mid-size as SSGs go.

<p>My digital garden is a more difficult story. It's published as a TiddlyWiki, which makes for a nice reading experience, a built-in search engine, and convenient offline reading. At the price of requiring JavaScript and forcing a download of all pages for reading a single one.  I have no good idea yet for doing better.</p>

If the Architect wants overlapping boxes, so be it.  The tool designer's job is to make the Architect's job of laying things out easier during the editing process, but, not overriding the Architect's intention for what the final (static) display should look like. The Architect gets the final say, not the automation. This is why I argue that Obsidian's graph view is useless - automation at the wrong time, when it's no longer wanted. There is no need to implement an "overlapping window manager".  Let the Architect do what is wanted, just provide boosts during the process of editing.</p>

Yeah I've been considering phantom boxes. The challenge is that collisions can cascade, and you might have 10 layers of phantom boxes. Which gets noisy. You start wondering which box is which. I'm still noodling on this.</p>
<p>The primary point of the 3rd video was to show the box on the right moving at the end. It overlaps with the shadow before the mouse is released. That's the intended indication that this will happen. So far that's the best I've been able to come up with that feels like an appropriate amount of noise.</p>
<blockquote><p>it is not up to tool designer to determine what the Architect should want.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole point of everything I do is to question categories like this. There are no externally imposed requirements, only internally conceived desires. If someone else uses my tools they're now both architect and tool designer. With me advising, for sure. But the goal should be to learn to fish.</p>

Yeah, good point.  Columns and rows are easily understood, and, people love spreadsheets.  ... There seem to be 2 extremes in this problem space - totally manual vs. totally automated - and nothing in between. A dangling question in my mind is "how to map between the two extremes?". How to make it easy to program, yet give a good UX (my Bank (RBC) is a prime example of too much emphasis on totally automated - easy to program, but, bad UX).</p>

I'm basically holding the centroid of the fingers immobile as I zoom. So the top-left of the viewport is constantly adjusted by centroid/oldzoom - centroid/newzoom. Does this seem like the best approach?</p>
<p>(I considered weighting by the finger that is moving more, but convinced myself I get that effect for free since the above adjustment is constantly happening as the fingers move.  But perhaps I'm rationalizing.)</p>

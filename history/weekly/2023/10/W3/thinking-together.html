I feel that it is an area that could be quite interesting, but I haven't got yet a clear understanding on what this will lead to.</p>
<p>I think that pretty soon most of end-user code will be generated with the help of LLM:s. Some thoughts/questions I've been thinking about:</p>
<ul><li>How to generate programming languages, libraries and abstractions that LLM:s can use well? Is that different from generating libraries etc for humans?</li></ul><ul><li>LLM:s are faster than humans in processing data, so API:s can be really wide and probably more complex than what would be practical for devs.</li><li>LLM:s can probably handle more condensed/optimized representation better, too.</li><li>And be able to infer system affordances directly from code.</li></ul><ul><li>How to support creating good and maintainable code from LLM:s? And will that matter? Or will actual code become irrelevant?</li><li>How to modularize apps so that they can be easily composed by LLM:s?</li></ul><ul><li>My hunch: making apps modular and composable would work really well with LLM:s already now and even better in the future. Doesn't matter if functional or OOP, as long as the LLM can understand the logic.</li></ul><ul><li>What kinds of new apps and malleable software will LLM:s enable?</li><li>Also: LLM:s could finally enable removing some boundaries between different programming tools, library ecosystems, etc, by enabling translations/bridges automatically.</li></ul><p>Any thoughts?</p>

Are there economic incentives?</p>
<p>Today's LLMs are not up to the task. Whatever they produce, code or prose, needs to be checked by a human if precision matters (which is almost always does in code).</p>
<p>Also, today's LLMs are not up to the taks of maintaining anything, because they themselves evolve too quickly. It's very much "move quickly and break things". If you write end-user code in a natural language and count on an LLM to turn it into precise instructions, at the very least you want those precise instructions to be reproducible over time.</p>

I'm partial to modifying programs by describing the transformation of the code.  LLMs might be useful for writing the first draft of those transformations.  That helps with the reproducibility issue because the LLM is describing the changes to the code in more structured way, not the code itself.  Unfortunately, as far as I know, there is no widely recognized syntax or system for describing program transformations.</p>

I think this kind of use-case could be interesting to explore and perhaps even more interesting than just creating for loops, if-statements, etc.</p>

For now, we attempt to accomplish through prompting, like "put your answer in the following JSON structure"... When it neglects to do so, we have to remind it via "now put your answer in the following JSON structure". Obviously not robust, but so far "good enough" for our use case. Another change that would help: eliminating the non-determinism in the reply. Can anyone explain why today's LLMs are not deterministic? Has non-determinism been added as a "feature" to avoid repetitive responses? Or is it somehow fundamental to the inference algorithm itself?</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe basic issue is that current neural nets operate with approximate real numbers, and occasionally roundoff in those numbers can be critical to ‚Äúdecisions‚Äù made by the neural net (typically because the application of the activation function for the neural net can lead to a bifurcation between results from numerically nearby values). And so, for example, if different LLMFunction evaluations happen on servers with different hardware and different roundoff characteristics, the results can be different.‚Äù</p>
<p>The next few paragraphs go into how GPU parallelism inserts nondeterminism too.</p>
<p>But that‚Äôs just an explanation of why it‚Äôs difficult to remove entirely. Most systems do insert it intentionally to produce variation in the responses.</p>

<blockquote><p>‚Äú‚Ä¶ whether it:</p>
</blockquote>
<p> (1) promotes justice;</p>
<p> (2) restores reciprocity;</p>
<p> (3) confers divisible or indivisible benefits;</p>
<p> (4) favours people over machines;</p>
<p> (5) whether its strategy maximizes gain or minimizes disaster;</p>
<p> (6) whether conservation is favoured over waste; and</p>
<p> (7), whether the reversible is favoured over the irreversible?‚Äù</p>
<p>I tried to <a href="https://slab.org/2022/02/11/ursula-franklins-tech-project-checklist/">summarise these points in a blog post here</a> or you can <a href="https://archive.org/details/the-real-world-of-technology">listen to the lectures</a> directly, or <a href="https://archive.org/details/realworldoftechn0000fran_u9w8/page/n9/mode/2up">read it in book form</a>.</p>
<p>I'll pull out a couple of quotes, first on 3) divisible/indivisible benefits:</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúIf you have a garden and your friends help you to grow a tremendous tomato crop, you can share it out among those who helped. What you have obtained is a divisible benefit and the right to distribute it. Whoever didn‚Äôt help you, may not get anything. On the other hand, if you work hard to fight pollution and you and your friends succeed in changing the practices of the battery-recycling plant down the street, those who helped you get the benefits, but those who didn‚Äôt get them too. What you and your friends have obtained are indivisible benefits.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and on 7) reversible vs irreversible:</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúThe last item is obviously important. Considering that most projects do not work out as planned, it would be helpful if they proceeded in a way that allowed revision and learning, that is, in small reversible steps.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>5) on maximising gain vs minimising disaster is also a really interesting point, where she argues against planning, and for finding the right conditions for something to grow, at its own rate.</p>

<p>&amp;gt; Critical code studies is the application of the hermeneutics of the humanities to the interpretation of the extra-functional significance of computer source code. ‚ÄúExtra‚Äù here does not mean ‚Äúoutside of‚Äù or ‚Äúapart from‚Äù but instead it refers to a significance that is ‚Äúgrowing out of‚Äù an understanding of the functioning of the code.
This piece also links to a few other interesting resources on the subject, including, the &lt;<a href="https://electronicbookreview.com/essay/critical-code-studies/|initial">https://electronicbookreview.com/essay/critical-code-studies/|initial</a> manifesto for critical code studies.&gt;</p>
<p>I also liked this quote,</p>
<p>&amp;gt; Still, reading code, even <em>without</em> interpreting its cultural significance, can be no easy task. Ask a professional programmer who inherits legacy code to maintain or, worse yet, to improve, and they will tell you about the dread of sorting out just-in-time code, minimally documented, written with hasty patches, full of compromises and workarounds. Even those who write their code in artistic projects can be shy about sharing their code out of embarrassment and self-consciousness. This shame is a product of the ‚Äúencoded chauvinism‚Äù of programming culture, one that can be fostered on the internet as much as it is in classrooms [&lt;<a href="https://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/17/2/000713/000713.html#marino2020|Marino">https://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/17/2/000713/000713.html#marino2020|Marino</a> 2020&gt;, 148].</p>

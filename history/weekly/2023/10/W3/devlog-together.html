Never done one of those before, the assignment was for a different job than I originally applied for, it exclusively used libraries and services I've never used before, and evidently <em>I'm too old for this shit.</em>  🤞</p>

That's just disrespectful of your time and/or intelligence. I'm in Canada, so I feel the remote thing extra hard. Most jobs in my field are in the US and even if they are fully remote require US residence. Current opportunity is with a company that is considering making an exception, because they were purchased by and in the process of being amalgamated with a company that has offices in Canada. That's a gong show waiting to happen, too. 🙄</p>

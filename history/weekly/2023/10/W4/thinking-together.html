<p>was using pointfree code in a table layout (related to stack based programming).</p>
<p>Some cells merged and changing on evaluation IIRC.</p>
<p>I initially thought that it was from <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathoda/">Jonathan Edwards</a>, but not so sure anymore.</p>
<p>I was not particularly convinced about the idea but some discussion</p>
<p>about stack based programming came up where this would be a nice reference I guess.</p>

<p>2022 –  <em><strong>Interleaved 2D Notation for Concatenative Programming</strong></em>  – by <strong>@Michael Homer</strong></p>
<p> Some quickly enlightening demo videos here:</p>

<p> It's a concatenative language.</p>
<p> It's not a stack based language. Slight differences I guess.</p>
<p> Also questionably point free with with the values unnamed but live values still shown.</p>
<p> <em>Comparison to stack based languages</em> </p>
<p>★  <em><strong>Similarities to a stack based language:</strong></em> </p>
<p> – also no variable names</p>
<p> – also the typical operations: dup, swap, dig</p>
<p> – also only variables with an arity of one or more (aka functions) are shown (and literals)</p>
<p> ★  <em><strong>Differences:</strong></em> </p>
<p> – There's no reverse polish notation.</p>
<p> – Unlike in in a stack based language there's no single stack.</p>
<p> Rather the representation make opportunities for parallel evaluation quite obvious.</p>
<p> – Variables have no names but are still displaying their live value like in a spreadsheet (not referring to the layout).</p>
<p> ⚠  <em><strong>It seems this is actually not a language but a projections style.</strong></em> </p>
<p> This is nice, meaning to some degree other language can potentially be projected into this representation.</p>
<p> Well, plus-minus some issues. Syntactic sugar mostly not carrying over. Readability in other projections.</p>
<p> Switching to a different projection one may want to give out human readable variable names though rather than assigning auto-generated ones.</p>
<p> Maybe this would be a viable additional projection target for some other languages (unison)?</p>
<p> No clue though how this would interact with algebraic effects.</p>
<p> <em>Comparison to ALDs</em> </p>
<p> <em>(</em> <a href="http://apm.bplaced.net/w/index.php?title=Annotated_lambda_diagram">apm.bplaced.net/w/index.php?title=Annotated_lambda_diagram</a> <em>)</em> </p>
<p> <em><strong>Relation of Michael Homers model to annotated lambda diagrams:</strong></em> </p>
<p> ★ ALDs give same obviousness of parallelity opportunities</p>
<p> ★ Unclear which representation is visually denser but likely not the ALDs</p>
<p> ★ ALDs (as in the current mockups) are not pointfree. Variable names do appear both …</p>
<p> – at the head of the function definition (and tops of let- and in- blocks) and</p>
<p> – as annotations of the horizontal value lines (i.e. as the arguments to functions)</p>
<p> ★ For Making the ALD code projection more aligned with Michael Homers model:</p>
<p> – replace value names with live values</p>
<p> – collapse let-in-blocks by substitution</p>
<p> (live values could still be added as "syngraphic" sugar in extended value lines, I digress …)</p>
<p> ★ flip &amp; dig (argument permutators)</p>
<p> – They both vanish in the ALD code projection no matter their location.</p>
<p> – They are just permuting the arguments by swapping application lines and all preceding dependents.</p>
<p> ★ dup</p>
<p> – only vanishes at the top level as it turns into two forks.</p>
<p> – otherwise less trivial as it induces an unavoidable let-in block.</p>
<p> (Uncurrying into tuples is a bad alternative as it hides away ALD circuitry, the whole point of ALDs)</p>

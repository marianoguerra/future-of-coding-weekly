<p>I'm Arcade Wise. I'm a teenager and I'm looking for a full-time job!</p>
<p>I have a ton of experience in Rust, C, Python, JavaScript, etc. and have done college-level research before I speak 3 languages fluently, and have lived in 3 different countries, on 2 continents, over the last 6 years.</p>
<p>I would prefer a smaller company, especially startups, and especially ones that offer relocation benefits. I prefer working in person, and am willing to move almost anywhere, but am also completely open to remote work.</p>
<p>Please check out my resum√©: <a href="https://arcades.agency/media/Arcade.pdf">arcades.agency/media/Arcade.pdf</a></p>

Recently, I've been squeezing any amount of time left over during the day into my personal projects. Work, family, chores, etc. take the rest. I'm curious how other manage their time reading books, reading whitepapers (which can be quite lengthy), working on their hobbies, etc.? I'm at the point where I haven't even played my guitar for months. I used to walk and listen to audio books also, which I haven't done lately. One caveat is that I've pulled all my personal projects into one master project, so there's always something to work on now. üôÇ</p>

<p>I work a four day week, so my fifth day is for my own projects! i also spend one evening a week on them. my partner spends one evening a week with her family so its worked out like that.</p>
<p>i usually make some music for a bit when i get home from work. only like 5 minutes though.</p>
<p>the rest of my time is for family and friends.</p>
<p>i don't have enough time though. everything is taking too long!</p>

<p>But I found that if I don't overthink it... I'm kind of okay with it. Hopefully I will have time to get around to them again. And if I do get time but have lost interest, cool, I will at that point already be a person who is not interested in them and I can make that ok.</p>
<p>On the other hand I've found a few pockets of hours of free time here and there, and I tend to just do whatever seems right at that moment. If it means rest, then rest. But one time I did 4 hours of painting on a whim even though I've only painted like 2 things in my adult life, and it rocked and I'm proud of it despite painting not being near my 'life goals.'</p>
<p>Maybe paradoxically my advice is don't invest too much expectation into the time you do get. Try to stay spontaneous wherever you can. Try to bias toward doing the thing you actually want to do at the moment, not always working toward some future achievements. The time may come when all that work will seem worthless but a random painting will bring you joy every day.</p>
<p>Too fluffy? Honestly this was me processing some things of my own in real time!</p>

<p>Buuuut, once every few months, I get the house to myself for an afternoon, or a weekend, and then I cover myself in war paint, unplug every electric device, and play xylophone until my fingers bleed.</p>
<p>YMMV.</p>

<p>This sounds sort of lame, but I do believe it is a skill that can be practiced. I go for a run or a bike most every day. While doing that I think about 1 or 2 things I‚Äôm working on, either for hobby stuff or at work so that when it comes time to ‚Äúdo them‚Äù I mostly just need to do the like mechanical bit of the task, or have a few experiments to try, or something of that sort.</p>
<p>I find this works pretty well for me, and I only trip, fall into holes, or run into trees a few times a month (this may be unrelated to my thinking).</p>

<p>One thing I've always done; practiced the Seinfeld strategy: I do something on my project every single day, without fail.  Even if I don't have any time, I'll go in, correct a comment, fix a spelling mistake.  But without fail I do  ~<em><em>something</em></em>~ .</p>

<p>one thing that got me going in the first place is: I accepted that I might not be the best or smartest coder in X field. but i might be able to be the most patient. so if i just  <em>keep going</em> , for longer than other people, however long that might take, then I'll eventually make something good. it's helped me to see the value in small but consistent doses of work. </p>
<p>this isn't advice! but maybe it's interesting to see how other people's cogs work</p>

After more or less failing my undergrad degree and 10 years of work as a software engineer (which I did mostly really enjoy) I managed to transition into research where my personal projects around live coding became my job. I got on a part time masters in arts computing (industrial experience standing in for my poor undergrad degree) and then a full time studentship to do a research degree. I became a father at the same time as starting the research degree, the flexible working and on site nursery worked out well.  Being a student was amazing but postdoc university life a bit less great in terms of having time to do research. Now I'm still doing full time fundamental research but outside of university, as part of a non profit research studio. </p>
<p>Despite the freedom lately I've felt a bit lost and unproductive. I guess it's not just about finding the time but also the energy and direction when you're doing self directed work. I've just started a bullet journal which I hope will introduce more intentionality to my work. I'd be happy to hear of others' experiences with that sort of thing!</p>
<p>More generally I think a four day week is a good idea for all involved.</p>

Furthermore I think about needed solutions/ideas a lot when offline (in the shower, during car drives, just before I go to sleep). I also keep a journal, make a lot of notes and I keep track of a backlog in which I mix actionable items and ideas I want to work on and specify further (I use google keep on my phone). </p>
<p>Podcasts I listen to in my car, even on short trips for just a few minutes sometimes.</p>
<p>I also wish I had more time to spend on my personal project and a lot of things take a lot of time and accepting that is sometimes hard. I also would like to make more videos about the project. But I currently prioritize working on the project over talking and making videos about it. Not taking it all to seriously helps me sometimes and focus more on having fun.</p>

<p>I discovered Philip Glass by chance, signing out "glassworks" cd from library based off album art. At the time I was coming off of listening to overtly technical music like prog, metal etc. I was tired of self-indulgent guitars &amp; meandering song structures that never end, and then I found philip glass who created textures I could have never imagined with use of very simple melodic loops &amp; rhythms that when layered ontop of each other created the most rich, beautiful &amp; outer-worldly music.</p>
<p>On a personal note, his career is also extremely inspiring as someone who didn't reach mainstream success until well into his 40s (and IMO his best work started then), and still making music now late into his 80s. I had a go at music in my early 20s and got burnt out, but knowing I have time to enrich &amp; progress as a creative is a very warm feeling.</p>

I just want to follow down the rabbit hole, as if I'm a deep sea diver, I go deep into what drives me as a person &amp; pull back something (music, code, etc).</p>
<p>This was how I approached music, and it feels weird that I have these internal debates to maintain that stance as a computer person.</p>

<p>As someone well into his 40s, I am grateful that youth does not seem to leave people these days in the same way it used to. At least I never really got the feeling that I grew up.</p>

For me I've always found that in punk-adjacent music.</p>
<p>In my late teens I discovered that "screamo" was a real genre, and not just a term to describe music with screaming. Emo, post-hardcode, hardcore, math rock all coming together with low barrier to entry DIY ethics.</p>
<p>In that scene the spectrum of what is acceptable is more broad than any I've seen. Some very gear-head oriented, metal influenced, some very primitive, some very melodic, some very rhythmic and angular. And somehow it all made sense to play together because we were united under the only thing that mattered - feelings, typically sad ones ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Other punk scenes exist which similar inclusivity &amp; open-mindedness.</p>
<p>That's where I want to stay, with the rest of people united on a shared meta-goal.</p>

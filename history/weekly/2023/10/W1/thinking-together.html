<p>Probably unpopular ideas, but here's my Black Mirror take:</p>
<ul><li>What's tasteful won't matter, as long as it's popular.</li><li>Success of these "spatial computing" concepts will come from what gets the masses interested.</li><li>Whatever will be successful, porn will do first, as they always have. Now the action is with you, or you're "there". Consent from other people actually with you is left as an exercise for the reader.</li><li>Ditto for Snapchat-like filters that are applied to other people in the room with you. Everyone naked? Everyone's a furry? Maybe we present virtually as we choose for other goggle-heads? Back to consent again, for, "who wants to see the naked furry centaur in the coffee shop?"</li><li>Extra points for integrating Dynamicland-like badges that people wear, interpreted by the goggles as, "don't VR-alter me." Another one for, "don't apply facial recognition to me." Naturally, law enforcement gets a version that the latter filter doesn't apply for, and the tech leaks to hacky patches for consumer hardware.</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div> <div class="replies"><div id="2023-09-26T05:43:13.535Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Ivan Reese</span> <a href="./?fromDate=2023-09-23&amp;toDate=2023-09-29&amp;channel=thinking-together&amp;filter=#2023-09-26T05:43:13.535Z" class="date">2023-09-26 05:43:13</a> <div class="message"><p>Meta note: a better link for that podcast would be <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/apple-vision-87396692">patreon.com/posts/apple-vision-87396692</a></p>

They threw a bunch out to the audience, and we quickly discovered we could mount the invisible wall that kept people off the stage.  Curiously, since participants were muted, despite the visual chaos of people mobbing the stage, the presentation was able to continue pretty much uninterrupted.</p>

But to be absolutely clear: if this sort of imagery and language ever appeared within a discussion here, where there's a good chance people would see it without the opportunity for adequate warning, it'd be a CoC violation.</p>

I think it depends a lot on how you explain that behaviour. I've used a lot of professional art tools where you can erase by selecting an "X" color â€” Flash, for instance. The audience being children probably helps here too, because if you explain "do this to erase" they won't likely push back with a lot of "well that's not how I'm used to working in other tools", perhaps.</p>

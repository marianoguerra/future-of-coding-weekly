<p>Thinking about how perceptually salient properties (such as spikiness/roundness, wonkiness) could be taken into account in a kind of analogue interpretation of the shapes alongside discrete symbol recognition as 'signposts' in feature space.</p>
<p>and what happens to those features when some symbols are marked out as higher order functions.</p>
<p>Thinking about syntax based on proximity and containment rather than adjacency.</p>
<p>also what happens when the parser itself is part of the scene.. e.g. how does its orientation change the parsing of the symbols?</p>
<p>Would love to hear about other projects that have explored this kind of area!</p>

<p>Could you expand on the difference and/or tension here?</p>
</div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2023-10-07T10:26:55.111Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Alex McLean</span> <a href="./?fromDate=2023-10-04&amp;toDate=2023-10-10&amp;channel=two-minute-week&amp;filter=#2023-10-07T10:26:55.111Z" class="date">2023-10-07 10:26:55</a> <div class="message"><p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/chrisshank23">Christopher Shank</a> Yes definitely! Conventional text-based programming languages are generally built on adjacency. This is a visual property in a way but I suppose a discrete one -- two things (characters, or words) are either adjacent or not -- so we don't tend to think of it as visuospatial.</p>
<p>Box-and-wire dataflow languages like max/pure data are built on connectedness, another discrete property. We tend to think of these as more visuospatial because you can arrange things how you like in a 2d arrangement, but this is all secondary notation rather than syntactical or semantic.</p>
<p>Proximity is where the arrangement enters the core language - things connect if they are proximal. This means you can assign additional meaning from  <em>how</em>  proximal things are. A really nice, successful example of this is <a href="http://reactable.com/">the reactable</a>. I'm not exploring this in the particular demo at the top of the thread, but think there are a lot of possibilities here. I explored this sort of thing some years ago with <a href="https://slab.org/2013/09/13/colourful-texture/">a haskell-based FRP front-end</a>.</p>
<p>Containment I guess is actually a separate issue. In this demo I'm exploring just drawing around groups of glyphs. In text-based systems we use parenthesis for this.</p>
<p>One nice thing about exploring proximity is the possibilities for collaboration. The reactable is again a really nice case study for this - they made it circular so there's no way 'up' and people can collaborate by standing around it. Way ahead of its time really.</p>

<p>The quality of generated results could be improved even now, as e.g. the models we are using at the moment are not the best possible.</p>
<p>Before we determine, if it‚Äôs worth doubling down on this effort we‚Äôre trading of that quality for price and speed.</p>
<p>This generative aspect is mostly for getting you started on exploring some topic, there are other little tools and features in the app that should take you bit further.</p>
<p>There might even an argument made that an inclusion of some more sophisticated verification tool for the generated content would be beneficial‚Äîthat is the kind of thing I‚Äôm interested to learn, so thank you!</p>
<p>I think the LLMs most likely are going to be widely used for research whether we like it or not. Given that I think it‚Äôs worth exploring the tools and interactions around them to find what‚Äôs useful, humane and fun üôÇ</p>

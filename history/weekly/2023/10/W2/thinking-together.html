It's a shame that the arts are often pushed out of 'future of coding' type circles. E.g. compare the first LIVE workshop on Live Programming which had loads of music-focussed contributions, with recent editions where the focus seems much more on abstract ideas for which 'real world' applications have not yet been found.</p>
<p>My understanding is that part of the reason for this is that for CS academics, associating their work with creative applications is generally seen very much as a career-limiting move</p>

<p>A wide-ranging history of the algorithm. Bringing together the histories of mathematics, computer science, and linguistic thought,&nbsp;Language and the Rise of the Algorithm&nbsp;reveals how recent developments in artificial intelligence are reopening an issue that troubled mathematicians well before the computer age: How do you draw the line between computational rules and the complexities of making systems comprehensible to people? By attending to this question, we come to see that the modern idea of the algorithm is implicated in a long history of attempts to maintain a disciplinary boundary separating technical knowledge from the languages people speak day to day. &nbsp; Here Jeffrey M. Binder offers a compelling tour of four visions of universal computation that addressed this issue in very different ways: G. W. Leibniz‚Äôs calculus ratiocinator; a universal algebra scheme Nicolas de Condorcet designed during the French Revolution; George Boole‚Äôs nineteenth-century logic system; and the early programming language ALGOL, short for&nbsp;algorithmic language.&nbsp;These episodes show that symbolic computation has repeatedly become entangled in debates about the nature of communication. Machine learning, in its increasing dependence on words, erodes the line between technical and everyday language, revealing the urgent stakes underlying this boundary. &nbsp; The idea of the algorithm is a levee holding back the social complexity of language, and it is about to break. This book is about the flood that inspired its construction.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm starting this topic as I‚Äôm reading ‚ÄúLanguage and the Rise of the Algorithm‚Äù by Jeffrey M. Binder, and would love a space to discuss it. I‚Äôll be posting notes and thoughts as I read. I‚Äôm interested in not only the ways we have conceptualized algorithms, but also how those notions have changed over time, and how those changes may relate to various types of technology surrounding language and patterning systems (especially as relates to textiles).</p>

He makes it sound like rigorous/non-natural languages are some conspiracy against communication, when the truth is that they keep convergently evolving because natural language simply does not do the job of communicating these things. People have tried doing math and computation in words over and over and it's miserable every time. </p>
<p>More to the point, the abstract idea of an algorithm is very specifically a tool for communication, and evolved the way it did to be more effective in that role. Any argument that wants to claim it's actually an obstacle has a very heavy lift in front of it, and nothing in that intro suggests the author is aware of that.</p>
<p>I would further claim than any notion of LLMs (I assume this is what he's referring to as "machine learning"?) breaking this trend is an illusion. They will either evolve some form of rigor or (more likely) produce inscrutable messes.</p>

That's a line of thought that can be traced back at least to Leibniz and easily beyond, to antiquity.</p>
<p>If there's a recent development that deserves criticism, it's the importance that algorithms have acquired in today's life. Computers have transformed them from a specialists' tool into one accessible not to everybody, but to a rather large elite, who is not always using it in the interest of the wider population.</p>

<p>It's a similar approach to Bret Victor in his "Future of Programming" talk. The 'future of programming' title seems to sometimes be taken unironically in this community but it's really about the past of programming, pointing out that in the early days, the possibilities were much more open than they are now, that programming has now got really stuck in a limited view of itself, and that we need to look back to look for ways of imagining an alternative future.</p>

In the history of science, it is a methodological precept to avoid falling into the style called ‚ÄúWhig history‚Äù‚Äîto avoid, that is, describing historical developments through linear narratives of progress that implicitly side with the positions that won. Histories of mathematical symbols tend to be extremely Whiggish, complimenting authors who use notations that later became standard and chastising those who do not. I certainly do not mean to deny the advantages of symbolism, but my purpose is less to celebrate it than to understand it, and I accordingly hope to describe what was lost with the adoption of symbols as well as what was gained. I also hope to show that the symbolic method is not a fixed category. The ways people have understood symbols changed multiple times over the centuries, and the modern idea of algorithm is a product of particular circumstances and epistemological commitments."</p>

I talked with the original organisers about this though and they were really open about the fact that they needed to disassociate their work from the arts for the sake of their careers. That's why they called it 'live programming' rather than 'live coding' - they wanted to create a new community that was separate from the existing community focussed on applications in the performing arts. That's totally understandable, but it's been a bit sad to see it drift away from acknowledging that community exists at all. To be fair there are probably similar separating forces on the other side.</p>

<p> <em>Superparentheses</em> :</p>
<p>Love the discussion about this topic üòõ. Haskell has  <code>$</code>  which means ‚Äòopening parenthesis that is closed by the end of the line‚Äô which gets a bit close to the idea of a ‚Äòsuper opening parenthesis‚Äô.</p>
<p> <em>C and GOTO:</em> </p>
<p>C came out after this paper, and its  <code>goto</code>  statement was neutered: It only allows  <em>local</em>  jumps (remaining in the same function) and only to hard-coded labels (though <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.8.0/gcc/Labels-as-Values.html#Labels-as-Values">a common GCC compiler extension</a> extends this to allow dynamic labels).</p>
<p>The closest C gets to unrestricted GOTO is  <code>setjmp</code> / <code>longjmp</code> ; but here the  <em>callee decides</em> where you jump to (just like with exceptions) so you can really only jump up on the stack, making them slightly less painful to reason about.</p>
<p>Neither gets used a lot: I mainly know the  <code>goto sosueme</code> idiom from a few of the talks of Alexei Alexandrescu in which he uses it in a hot code path because the resulting machine code is better optimized. And  <code>setjmp</code> / <code>longjmp</code>  is used in some places to emulate exceptions or coroutines in plain C, but whenever the OS provides higher-level abstractions to use here they are preferred (just like how OS support for threading is better than rolling your own spin-locks).</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, love your relentless efforts to add the Dijkstra sting every time üòÇ. Editing this episode must have taken painfully long üôá.</p>

<p>These are some rough thoughts I wasn't expecting to share publicly for a long time, if at all, but it seems to be inevitable for me to hit a point of, wth, throw it out there. In this case the impetus was <strong>@Alex McLean</strong>'s comments on <a href="./?fromDate=2023-10-03&amp;toDate=2023-10-09&amp;channel=linking-together&amp;filter=#2023-10-06T04:45:36.918Z">üí¨ #linking-together@2023-10-06T04:45:36.918Z</a></p>
<p>The way I see it, capitalism currently performs many load-bearing functions in the world, but the world today suffers from capitalism being the predominant engine of meaning/motivation. Why do we get out of bed and do anything? The places we tend to pay attention to are governed by social proof, a sense that others are paying attention. Social proof is in turn governed by status seeking; we all want to be "successful", and in our efforts to be successful we chase the prospects of success around us. We're more likely to attend to something if it promises to be successful. And finally, closing the loop, the metrics for "success" are basically money at root. Everything else seems to get grounded at some level of indirection in money.</p>
<p>All this hit home particularly hard when listening to the first hour of <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/065">episode 65</a> (totally awesome, and having nothing to do with the title), where <a href="http://ivanish.ca/">Ivan Reese</a> at one point says, to be taken seriously you have to signal effort. And at a second point: one way to signal effort is to spend a lot of money. All totally right and obvious for the world we live in. And yet.. I'm kinda feeling done with seeing large projects spending lots of money as more intrinsically meaningful? We've seen many many examples of the same depressing way large projects with lots of money fail. Money invariably has strings attached.</p>
<p>So, I'd like to live in a world where money exists, but more people consider it a satisficing rather than optimizing criterion. Something that inhabits the lower levels of Maslow's Hierarchy and gets banished from the upper level that it has somehow infected while we weren't looking.</p>
<p>What might replace money as a source of meaning and motivation for programmers? One answer I've been rolling around in my mouth and feeling increasingly ok with is: durability. Durability has a long track record (i.e. monuments) as something that can motivate people. Software is currently really bad at building durable artifacts, and not I think for any intrinsic reason. We just haven't prioritized it. I think a world where software artifacts can be easily run a decade later -- without any modification -- would be a significantly better world than the one we live in. In such a world, software would be part of the solution rather than the problem.</p>
<p>So, with that lengthy preamble, here's the draft I've been noodling on.</p>
<p> <em>Draft: A programmer's pledge</em> </p>
<p>Given that:</p>
<ul><li>We are on this planet for a brief time and will take nothing with us when we leave; and that</li><li>The effects of our actions compound for good and for ill, long after we are gone, in ways we cannot always anticipate; and that</li><li>I want to be helpful to others, and for the good in my actions to outweigh the bad; and that</li><li>I want to persuade you that I truly believe the above, that I want to be helpful more than I care about my own gain and aggrandizement;</li></ul><p>Therefore, I pledge to:</p>
<ul><li>Tell you, when I build anything, what I hope to gain from it. If it's money I'll tell you how much in inflation-adjusted currency, and I'll commit to giving away anything beyond that while unencumbering any secrets it took to create it. If I create organizations or foundations around what I build, I'll enshrine these limits on value capture into their bylaws.</li><li>Tell you, up front, when it will be done. I'll provide a clear test for features I will add, and when I will stop adding features.</li><li>Show my thought process in my efforts to make it durable. Even after it's done, it might need changes to be runnable on people's computers. What have I done to minimize the likelihood of such changes? What have I learned from past projects that makes this one more durable than them?</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div> <div class="replies"><div id="2023-10-06T22:00:34.921Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Arcade Wise</span> <a href="./?fromDate=2023-10-03&amp;toDate=2023-10-09&amp;channel=thinking-together&amp;filter=#2023-10-06T22:00:34.921Z" class="date">2023-10-06 22:00:34</a> <div class="message"><p>That's a really cool idea!

I think for me meaning comes from understanding/learning what I'm doing through the process of coding it, sharing software I've made and then see people do weird unexpected things with it, and connecting with others through live coding. Making money from it isn't really a motivation, although that is a privilege really.. plus I work for a non-profit and am not allowed to make commercial products or prototypes as a condition of my funding..</p>

But we tend to forget that lots of other economic systems share the fundamental issue of capitalism of not respecting the limits of the biosphere. All growth-oriented systems, to be more precise. And that's everything starting with agriculture. The quest for growth has been going on for a few thousand years, with lots of variations, but always the same outcome of humans and their sphere of influence (technology, crops, domestic animals, ...) taking an increasing share of natural resources (energy, water, ...). Capitalism is merely the most technically perfected way of striving for growth.</p>

<p><strong>@Alex McLean</strong> I wasn't really thinking about digital artists or live-coding communities when I wrote that draft. (Do y'all call yourselves "programmers"? I can see a case for that seeming like a cooty-inducing term üòÑ) My focus is more on a dynamic of "productive" software that insinuates itself into people's habits, and then exercises power (often accompanied by rent extraction). I think y'all are all good here. (Though do tell me if I seem to be mischaracterizing you, or if I sound like I'm excluding anyone. I tend to think of y'all's position as: you get a voice, but you don't bear much responsibility for what has occurred so far.)</p>
<p><a href="https://khinsen.net/">Konrad Hinsen</a> There are certainly many problems facing the world today, and my two paragraphs aren't intended to address them all. Re growth vs sustainability, I'll just point out that getting people to think hard about what we each find meaningful seems more resource-efficient than having whole countries go through the motions of bullshit jobs just to engage in zero-sum status games, all while mining the planet and polluting externalities. A focus on durable artifacts will hopefully lead to fewer artifacts.</p>
<p>My focus is just on programmers. I don't pretend to know enough to tell other industries or fields what to do.</p>
<p>&lt;/handwave&gt;</p>
<p>I'm deliberately positioning the pledge at the level of individual projects. There's no limit on how many projects a person can start. At the same time, the start of a project is a high-leverage point at which to set its trajectory. I think we all have experience of joining projects later. It's much harder to change their direction then. Whatever the rules were at the start, we mostly tend to follow them.</p>
<p>Re "enterprise", one thing I want to draw attention to is that the value capture limit is phrased as a raw number, not a per capita number. And it is not profit. These are two deliberate decisions. I tend to think there's something vaguely unethical about successful artifacts indefinitely milking society to hire increasing numbers of people for indefinite periods that mostly has the effect of degrading the artifact. I'd like it to be more "glamorous" to build something, freeze it and disband. (Like a game or a movie.) Get what you wanted out of it, then give it away. (Not like a game or movie at the moment.) Get out of the way for a new project to build on the artifact. This worldview considers one-time charges for products morally/ethically superior to ongoing subscriptions. (Services of course are a separate matter. I don't have an opinion there. Though there might be an argument that programming is fundamentally about building artifacts, and the need for something to be an ongoing service is a failure on some level..)</p>

I am indeed a programmer, although don't really see any distinction between programming and coding - I use them interchangeably.

Certainly music software is productive, gets into peoples habits and can exert commercial power. Some people (like Steven Pinker) don't see music as serious or important but I strongly disagree, it's intrinsic to human life. and I think it is also intrinsic to the 'future of coding'.</p>

Not able to put it into exact words yet, but I have the feeling I'd like the pledge part to be more human and nature centred and less about economics. I do understand 'capitalism' and 'money' were your points of attention. And I'm also very much in favour of moving away from money as a driver for what we do or don't. If we try to move away from  economics (say "no" to), what are we actually after (say "yes" to), what could we pledge then? Just from the hip: "I will build things which empower humans (instead of taking away their empowerment/agency)", 'I will build things others can build with me (search for co-creation)", "I will not build things which are 'over' sufficient (I will not build too much)", "I will build things that are durable for the foreseen lifetime", etc. The last bit being about resource usage which has it marks on our environment(al footprint).</p>
<p>I'm trying to see if I can come up with a more concise set of pledges the coming weeks. See how well I do on those in my work üòâ.</p>

A big part of making music for me is making new representations for music, which is really hard and is definitely some of the most interesting and technically challenging work I've done in my career. Actually making live music by live coding does feel very different though in a number of ways.. Being fully absorbed in the sonic output of your code while changing it, with a room full of people are dancing to it, is just a lovely time. It does seem like a very different activity to systems programming, but someone has to program the live coding system in the first place, and building and using systems happens in the same community, with everyone coding in some way.. like with dynamicland, things can get interesting when you break down the barriers between systems programming and live interaction.</p>

I'd love to see more ideas for a pledge that includes these topics.</p>
<p>One criterion that seems important to me is objectivity. It should be really obvious to someone juggling a baby whether you're hewing to your pledge or not. A pledge that tries to say more but permits equivocation seems like a net negative to me. Because then you can paper over broken promises with marketing. I.e. by spending money. Which brings us back to the sad situation we're trying to escape.</p>
<p>If you lived around the era of competing models of the cosmos in the late 1500s after Copernicus, you would be totally correct to expect that a good theory should explain the lack of Coriolis forces on the Earth's surface. But it took 300 years to get a good story here, and in the meantime we went through 3 more models of the heavens that incrementally improved things. So the world doesn't always cooperate with the expectations people have..</p>
<p>At this point in our history it seems to me that with some of these thorny questions like sustainability or efficiency, a direct approach is unlikely to succeed. It'll just be too easy to game. But they were very much on my mind when I came up with my draft, and I've tried to indirectly nudge people in the right direction along those dimensions, as best I could.</p>
<p>Hopefully this clarifies some of the rationale for my current design. But I'm only trying to explain my thought process, not discourage others from exploring these directions.</p>

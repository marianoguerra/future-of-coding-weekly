Her approach seems to have a lot more in common with Leibniz et al than I was expecting, in terms of addressing the political and social contexts of symbols.</p>

It is something I needed to hear this morning - grateful for work that engages with the flawed social contexts of CS in a nuanced and sympathetic way.</p>
<p>Binder's STS project has got a cogent description of Leibniz's notations as an early upstream of blackboard cultures, like maths and CS (i.e. the refuge of constructive mathematics).</p>
<blockquote><p>This algebraic sense of 
 <em>algorithm</em> 
 [...] placed the idea in an intimate relation to the development of new symbolic notations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another useful downstream of STS (by way of Susan Leigh Star's reading of symbolic notations as boundary objects) might be Ribes' "The logic of domains". With his lens, I'd read Ko's description of CS as having the useful domain-like characteristic of normalizing / abstracting problems, but also an unfortunate tendency of neutralizing / colonizing other domains.</p>

However, this overly abstract view is na√Øve and can lead to software errors. For example, some data encapsulates resources subject to protocols (e.g., file and device handles, channels); some data has confidentiality requirements and thus should not be copied or communicated</p>
<p>arbitrarily. Dually, some programs have non-functional properties (e.g., execution time) dependenton data (e.g., on its size). Thus, the reality is that some data acts as a resource, subject to constraints. In this paper we present Granule, a typed functional language that embeds a notion of data as a resource into the type system in a way that can be specialised to different resource and dataflow properties. Granule‚Äôs type system combines linear types, indexed types (lightweight dependent types), and graded modal types to enable novel quantitative reasoning.</p>

<p>Im reminded by alan kay talking about the early browsers (unknown reference) basically what if applications shipped their runtimes. I kind of thought of a more general &amp; inspectable html at the time but i think this is very interesting too</p>

In the earlier days of the live coding community (early 2000's), there was a feeling against the idea of an audience. At least, the 'powerbooks unplugged' audience would reject the stage and sit within the audience, writing code to make music for each other and the people around them, but rejecting the separation between producers and consumers. You can extend the idea to say that programmers should reject the idea of having users.</p>

<p>Datomic is mentioned and it definitely didn't get jeffed. Nor did dark, or anything else I can think of that is using hosting to fund language development. (I know datomic is closed source, but no datalog database has been jeffed (sadly))</p>
<p>But even if you do get jeffed, that isn't death. The companies that have changed license because of AWS taking their open source work are massive companies still. In fact, it is their relicense because of the worry about jeffing that seems to be causing their long term issues.</p>

<blockquote><p>Forth is hard to read. Maybe you can create abstractions to make it easier to read, but it‚Äôs going to cost you in terms of simplicity and at some point it becomes self-defeating: maybe the language you‚Äôre after isn‚Äôt Forth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it‚Äôs inherent to Forth, reading it simply requires a much higher cognitive load because you have to hold a lot more information into your head as you read along. It‚Äôs exhausting for the mind (but you get better at it after a while). It is also slower. Accept it or you‚Äôre going to have a bad time.</p>
<p>(FWIW, I do find this work to be compelling in the context of its intended use ‚Äì maintaining use of electronics after widespread economic collapse.)</p>

A big part of making music for me is making new representations for music, which is really hard and is definitely some of the most interesting and technically challenging work I've done in my career. Actually making live music by live coding does feel very different though in a number of ways.. Being fully absorbed in the sonic output of your code while changing it, with a room full of people are dancing to it, is just a lovely time. It does seem like a very different activity to systems programming, but someone has to program the live coding system in the first place, and building and using systems happens in the same community, with everyone coding in some way.. like with dynamicland, things can get interesting when you break down the barriers between systems programming and live interaction.</p>

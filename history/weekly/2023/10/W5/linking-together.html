<p>Anyone play around with this? I was given this back in first-year comsci, and I think honestly there's few tools which top it.</p>

I like being able to visually comment / document code, and that it's "live". The ball example, however, could also be expressed as a visual design (not just a visual link), as in Flash or other visual design tool, with the properties and events on the right.</p>
<p>I've been prototyping a very simple designer with a "properties and events" panel, and am trying to find the balance between not writing any code (on event onMouseDown, run action "playNote", argument "C4", for example). In this sense, inactive elements could be placed on the canvas or off-screen like the convention used in Flash. Let my tidy up my Balsamiq and post it here.</p>

<p>I imagine being able to import actions such as for music, setting shape properties, game effects (jump, spin, etc.) without having to write code, but you should also be able to create your own actions very easily and use the editor towards the bottom.</p>
<p>Thoughts? I didn't mean to hijack, but I was just about to post my own related topic.</p>

This is giving me some ideas, thanks for posting!</p>

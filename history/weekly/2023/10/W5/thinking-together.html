<p>Background: I'm starting to think about building a new forum. Given <a href="https://akkartik.name/freewheeling/">my past</a>, it won't surprise anyone that I mean to do this outside the morass of non-convivial software that is the modern web browser. My broad plan is:</p>
<ul><li>L√ñVE v12 will support https, and <a href="https://github.com/love2d/love/actions">release candidates</a> are already quite stable. Good enough to start building on.</li><li>I'll build my forum out of a server-side API in Lua and a client in L√ñVE v12. (Should be easy to support Windows, Linux, BSD and Android. Mac and iOS will require some annual contortions to build L√ñVE for oneself.)</li><li>The server side will of course be open source just like the client. In addition, all post/comment data will be published to a git repo on something like a daily basis.</li></ul><p>The one major open question concerns authentication. How can we have stable identity? The above architecture is intended to allow anyone to host the forum (without trying to build galaxy-brain merkle trees, federated protocols or CRDTs), and I would prefer to not take a position of power as the source of everyone's hashed passwords (an intrinsically centralizing architecture).</p>
<p>A few months ago someone showed me this ancient essay called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091126092028/http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2009/3/12/33338/3000">"attacked from within"</a>, and I find myself thinking about it often. The whole thing is worth reading, but for this thread the crucial list of bullets halfway down is:</p>
<ul><li>Registration keeps out good posters.</li><li>Registration lets in bad posters.</li><li>Registration attracts trolls.</li><li>Anonymity counters vanity.</li></ul><p>A provocative worldview that seems at least worth exploring. Keeping this in mind, I have a hazy idea that looks like this:</p>
<ul><li>When you run the client you get to choose your handle, but it's not unique (cf. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle">Zooko's Triangle</a>)</li><li>When you run the client for the first time, it creates an RSA keypair for you.</li><li>When composing messages, the client signs the message with your private key (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#Signing_messages">description on Wikipedia</a>)</li><li>When rendering messages, the client validates the signature against your public key and shows something like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identicon">identicon</a> of the public key.</li></ul><p>Implications of this setup:</p>
<ul><li>No registration</li><li>Your "password" (private key) never leaves your device(s).</li><li>When reading a thread you see a handle like  <code>spiralganglion</code> . However, the handle is not authoritative. Next to it is an identicon that is authoritative.</li><li>It's easy in a thread to see if there are ever two people with the same handle but different identicons.</li><li>Since the client platform is starting from scratch, accessibility and internationalization will be a challenge for a long time üòï</li></ul><p>No guarantees this is all doable. It's quite possible the cryptographic operations will be untenably slow when implemented in Lua, and a native library for them would complicate the simple install story that is L√ñVE's greatest strength.</p>
<p>But I'm curious to get people's thoughts on this idea in principle.</p>

<p>And yet, it's starting to feel like my projects need a central place of their own where someone can come see past questions and discussions that are currently only centralized in my notes. (And if it gets people here off Slack, I wouldn't be above spinning up a forum that forks this place.)</p>
<p>So I have zero grounds to pretend at any sort of knowledge or expertise on moderation. Mostly I figure, it looks like I have to get to this some time, the sooner I start, the more of a hope I have of learning to not suck at it. So your question about these gradations completely goes over my head. But ask me after I've been running something for a year.</p>
<p>Oh, one random note: Maybe pseudonymity makes harassment more difficult? It's easier in my system to create a new handle than it is on say ActivityPub. Does that seem to move the needle?</p>

</div> <div class="attachments"><blockquote><p>üìù <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet_newsgroup">Usenet newsgroup</a></p>
<p>A Usenet newsgroup is a repository usually within the Usenet system, for messages posted from users in different locations using the Internet. They are discussion groups and are not devoted to publishing news. Newsgroups are technically distinct from, but functionally similar to, discussion forums on the World Wide Web. Newsreader software is used to read the content of newsgroups.
Before the adoption of the World Wide Web, Usenet newsgroups were among the most popular Internet services.
Communication is facilitated by the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) which allows connection to Usenet servers and data transfer over the internet.  Similar to another early (yet still used) protocol SMTP which is used for email messages, NNTP allows both server-server and client-server communication.  This means that newsgroups can be replicated from server to server which gives the Usenet network the ability to maintain a level of robust data persistence as a result of built-in data redundancy.  However, most users will access using only the client-server commands of NNTP and in almost all cases will use a GUI for browsing as opposed to command line based client-server communication specified in the NNTP protocol.</p>

<p>In that context, your question about authentication becomes: which sign-up effort will my intended audience accept?</p>

<p>The biggest assumption to me here is around accessibility ‚Äî while an OS or browser brings a TON of headaches and complexity, it also brings with it a TON of accessibility tooling that love2d has none of. I can‚Äôt change the text appearance of a love2d application without modifying the application, and while I know how to do that, it isn‚Äôt necessarily as easy as using my operating system‚Äôs zoom capabilities.</p>

<p>Like, if you think through the architecture, it is sort of backwards how we apply accessibility as sort of a veneer on top of a finished product, even WCAG is this -- it is accessibility guidance when a standard already exists. Why not bake it into the standard? Why not have a standard for how to implement accessible rendering of an element like they do for browsers, instead most accessibility tech (even the stuff baked into browsers a lot of the time) mostly function as a black box. It is hard to tell what they do and why</p>

<blockquote><p>Designing adaptable pages is designing accessible pages. And perhaps the great promise of the web, far from fulfilled as yet, is accessibility, regardless of difficulties, to information. It‚Äôs an important belief of the

<p>With in band telephone signaling, telephone system devices communicated with each other using special tones that were sent over the same audio channel as the voice communications. This made it possible for people to manipulate the devices by playing tones into their telephone. The data is the voice communication, and the metadata is the phone system signaling information. By sending them in the same channel, it became possible for people to corrupt the metadata through carefully chosen values of data.</p>
<p>People who construct SQL queries by including user supplied data, rather than using placeholders, create the risk that carefully chosen values of data, namely the thing being searched for or stored, can corrupt the "metadata," (okay, I'm stretching a little here, but the principle is the same.) that being the structure of the SQL query itself.</p>

<p>Ultimately what I've found and that they mention in the book - programming/engineering is heavily dominated by the formalist world...so it can be hard if you find yourself as the only person in the team with the opposite view of programming</p>

However I‚Äôm unsure if you talk about what I think you do, or if I‚Äôm just reading into your post what I want it to say.</p>
<p>Let me try a few seemingly random questions to tease out what you are trying to point at:</p>
<ul><li>The original Gang of Four  ~<em><em>Design Patterns</em></em>~ , do they exemplify what you are trying to point at? Or are they irrelevant for that? Or are they perhaps even a counter example?</li><li>Some ontologies try to categorize everything in one huge tree (eg. biological species). Others are just trying to paint a comprehensible picture of complex local relationships. One could say the former is more concerned with identifying all the nodes while the latter is more concerned with identifying all the edges. Would you agree that the former feels misguided or irrelevant for what you mean and the latter is closer to it?

<blockquote><p>If so, how does "future of coding" even matter if any form of real adoption feels impossible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Making a new thread about this because the other one has become about OO instead of this bit)</p>
<p>I feel this deeply. It can often feel as if things don't get adopted. That programming doesn't change for the better. I have so many thoughts on this, it is hard to summarize.</p>
<p>First, I do think we can get others to adopt the things we value. It is almost never an education issue, imo and instead a value question. (I am intentionally leaving aside the OO frame here). Think about the impact that Rich Hickey has had on how many people code, not just clojure people, but in the industry broadly. How did he do it? Through Simple Made Easy, a talk largely about values, not techniques. The same is true of Bret Victor's influence on the future of coding community. He communicated values that others adopted.</p>
<p>I've found this to be true in practice as well. Trying to convince people to change their coding style requires diligence, communicating values, and showing how code improves because of these values. Conflict often happens when people implicitly hold very different values. I'm going to bet that is the case in the original example given.</p>
<p>But I also want to step back and ask, what kind of adoption, by who, by how many people? I'm willing to bet a lot of people in this slack listen to some genre of music that isn't completely mainstream. Have those genres failed because of the lack of becoming mainstream? Would they be better if they became mainstream?</p>

<p>As someone who builds ambitiously in my free time, I can honestly say that adoption is not a great metric for success in software. I've spend 6 years working on a single open source suite and so far I know that there is 1 actual user. I learned  <em>sooo</em>  much along the way though and I choose that as the metric for success here because if I used adoption it would be an unequivocal failure.</p>

<p>What we call ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù is a way of scripting single-threaded[sic] CPUs in a fairly rigorous and efficient manner.  What non-programmers want is not to be bothered with all of that bumph.  BASIC and SpreadSheet language are sufficient and don‚Äôt involve deep thinking about the actual act of programming.  The missing layer of UX is something like a mapping from BASIC to extreme lambda calculus.  Example: in the Lisp world, FEXPRs are convenient, while hygienic macros are more rigorous, but, less convenient for non-zealots.  How do we provide a method for programming that presents ultra-rigour as a convenient-to-use IDE?  Forcing non-programmers to think deeply and rigorously about programming ain‚Äôt it. [My bet is on box-and-arrow diagrams using 0D, non-conventional uses of OhmJS, PEG, SVG, HTML, etc., but, YMMV].</p>

<p>In&amp;amp;nbsp; the 1960s a small project started at the University of Illinois. This project, called PLATO, would go on to pioneer a truly impressive amount of new technology, including the first plasma screen, MMO video games, and time-sharing.

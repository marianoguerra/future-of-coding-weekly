I lived through the shift to recursion. I note, though, that recursion and functions make sense only for single-threaded pieces of hardware which is how CPUs and Memory were perceived in the 1950s.  Today, we can have bowls full of CPUs with their own local memories, which changes the ground truth about hardware.  While it is possible to extrapolate recursion to describe distributed systems, the recursive  mind-set leads to epicycles such as thread safety, multi-tasking operating systems, thread libraries, loops, etc., i.e. a generally horrible DX (Developer eXperience) for creating distributed programs.</p>

<blockquote><p>Online collaboration is becoming prevalent in our day-today work. As commercial applications show, next to texts, spreadsheets are an essential tool for storing and organizing shared data. However, concurrent modifications of a collaborative spreadsheet can lead to unexpected results when they reflect implementation decisions rather than user intention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this paper, we systematically discuss spreadsheet operations and their semantics and propose intention-preserving designs in a concurrent decentralized setting, thus supporting offline operations. We further explore different data models for shared spreadsheets based on composed Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) and give an implementation in the local-first framework Yjs.</p>

This goes  <em>hard</em> !</p>
<blockquote><p>In this section will be explained, how the communication between different marbles and their interpretation of symbols works. It will also be further elaborated on, what marbles in the Pinocchioverse are (an ore) and one will get a better understanding of some of their special properties.</p>
<p>First of all, the marble ore is an ore floating in space in the form of asteroids, occasionally hitting other planets. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The marble ore has many interesting properties. For once, in- stances of the marble ore are always perfect spheres, which may vary greatly in size. Furthermore, each marble has access to an infinite amount of energy saved inside it, which can be made use of for rotating the marble. Also, if different marbles touch, they are activated and if configured correctly, they can transform said energy into physical energy, meaning rotation. </p>
<p>The other main property of the marble ore is that every instance of the ore in the whole universe is connected to each other instance of the marble ore. That means that all marbles are directly connected to one another. Through symbols, which were already introduced in the last section, marbles can be activated over these connections without them touching. That means through their cluster-form, they are able to process information, usually symbols, for example to form connections between instances and active each other‚Äôs powers. This is done by sending a message with the written symbol to all other marbles, which they answer whether they have the same symbol written on them or not. If this is the case, they are activated and send a positive answer back. If not, they are not activated and send a negative answer back. Depending on the answers from all the other marbles, the initial marble is activated if there was at least one other marble with the same symbol, or not, if there was none. This was also already be made use of in the last sections to remotely activate a marbles power without needing to touch it with another marble and  <em>use it for technical innovation.</em> </p>
<p>The collective union of all marbles in the universe is called the marble ore collective, the marble net, the marble cluster or the marble myzel. The marble ore is unbreakable, it cannot be melted and crafted together with other marble ore instances. That means that the marble ore collective will always stay fully intact. </p>
<p> <em>One does not need the marble net to understand how any of the last examples work, neither does it give one any advantage in constructing marble-run devices; however, it does give one a better understanding of the marbles and the workings of the world of the Pinocchioverse in general and makes for an overall rounder world understanding, contributing to a more confident and possibly also more effective use of marbles, marble tracks and the devices they run.</em> </p>

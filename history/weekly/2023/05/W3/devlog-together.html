<p>Scrappy prototypes are great: they allow scrappy iteration and quick evaluation.

<blockquote><p>A great piece is basically balanced right on the edge of failure and success.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's just balanced right there.</p>
<p>But you don't really know how or where that line is.</p>
<p>So you're very excited about that idea, it's spectacular to you.</p>
<p>And you go and do it even though you don't seem like it.</p>
<p>You're going into it with a little bit of fear and trepidation to get too close to that line because you don't want to fail and lose it.</p>
<p>But once you do fail it... all that's gone.</p>
<p>Now it's game on.</p>
<p>It's all about just learning, right?</p>
<p>So if it's a piece that you know is going to take four and a half hours and at 3 hours, it's kind of screwed up.</p>
<p>And you just say, okay, let's stop and start over.</p>
<p>Well, you really don't know what happens in hour 3 to 5. You have no idea.</p>
<p>So when you get to three again. Now, you have no idea what's coming.</p>
<p>So my idea is usually  <em>if I screw up, screw it up all the way that I can to find out exactly what's hiding, what vocabulary of intuition has not been developed, what part of that language</em> .</p>
<p>So now I've screwed it up, screwed it up, screwed it up all the way until the finish.</p>
<p>We know where things might happen.</p>
<p>So now, when I go back into it, I've got the intuition more developed.</p>
<p>I mean,  <em>failure ends up being a good space for discovery</em> , right?</p>
<p>But it's like,  <em>if I'm going to fail,</em> </p>
<p> <em>let's keep failing,</em> </p>
<p> <em>let's keep screwing up.</em> </p>
<p> <em>Let's see what's there. Let's go find out.</em> </p>
<p> <em>You know, but if you just stop and put it away and start over, you're kind of missing out on a lot</em> .</p>

I regularly find myself saying "I don't think we are there, yet," because there are unanswered questions that are more basic. But that's not actually the point. The point is whether what we learn from going further is worth the effort. Low cost failure is to be sought out. That's what happened, here. I did a bad version of the next thing, it was cheap, easy, and it taught me a bunch. So the control to exercise is to seek out a context that is "the whole thing." ü§î</p>

Today, it is espoused in the Religion of Agile development.  It used to be a thrust in some pre-CL Lisps.</p>
<p>The idea is that you HAVE to screw around with ideas to try to figure out what the requirements are.  Users will NEVER specify enough details, so, it is incumbent upon you - the Architect and the Engineer - to figure out what the requirements are.</p>
<p>Screwing around with ideas needs to be supported by languages that make throwing prototypes away easy.  Building elaborate type systems is counter-productive when screwing around with ideas.  Sunk Cost Fallacy - if you‚Äôve spent lots of time working out the details of a type system, you are less likely to want to throw it away.  Instead you will want to tweak the elaborate type system, even when that doesn‚Äôt make sense.</p>
<p>Just about all of our popular languages cause you to enter into the domain of Sunk Cost Fallacy.  Predict the Future.  Over-confidence in the correct-itude of a design.  No room for screwing around and throwing code away.</p>
<p>After several, iterative rounds of screwing around, you might Production-Engineer an idea and turn it into an actual product.  This is the point where current popular languages (Haskell, Python, Rust, etc.) become useful.</p>

Mental visualization as a technique for achieving goals plays a big role in Neuro-Linguistic Programming.

<p>I conjecture that purveyors of statically-typed, textual languages ‚Äúsee‚Äù structure ‚Äúin their heads‚Äù, but feel forced to pound the structure down for use with pointy sticks and clay tablets.</p>
<p>In Physics, I learned that to understand a seemingly-complicated problem required breaking the problem down (‚Äúdivide and conquer‚Äù) then creating a unique notation for that problem aspect (a different notation for each aspect) and to apply ‚Äúsimplifying assumptions‚Äù to the new notation to make the aspect-under-scrutiny seem less complicated.  While, of course, remaining cognizant of the simplifying assumptions and remaining cognizant of not using the notation beyond its sweet spot.</p>
<p>I think that software development is like that, too.  You drill down on a particular aspect of a problem, ignoring the rest.  When you come up for air, you see other aspects that need to be solved.  All popular programming languages are the same and force you to think inside the same kind of box.  Simpler solutions to a problem might not be apparent, nor seem very simple from inside the single box.</p>
<p>Maybe what is being experienced is the freedom to think - to solve a problem instead of force-fitting the problem for expression within the confines of a single given notation or a single style of thought.</p>

Today, it is espoused in the Religion of Agile development.  It used to be a thrust in some pre-CL Lisps.</p>
<p>The idea is that you HAVE to screw around with ideas to try to figure out what the requirements are.  Users will NEVER specify enough details, so, it is incumbent upon you - the Architect and the Engineer - to figure out what the requirements are.</p>
<p>Screwing around with ideas needs to be supported by languages that make throwing prototypes away easy.  Building elaborate type systems is counter-productive when screwing around with ideas.  Sunk Cost Fallacy - if you‚Äôve spent lots of time working out the details of a type system, you are less likely to want to throw it away.  Instead you will want to tweak the elaborate type system, even when that doesn‚Äôt make sense.</p>
<p>Just about all of our popular languages cause you to enter into the domain of Sunk Cost Fallacy.  Predict the Future.  Over-confidence in the correct-itude of a design.  No room for screwing around and throwing code away.</p>
<p>After several, iterative rounds of screwing around, you might Production-Engineer an idea and turn it into an actual product.  This is the point where current popular languages (Haskell, Python, Rust, etc.) become useful.</p>

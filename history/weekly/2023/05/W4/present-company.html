<p>Everything I've heard from people who are on those sites indicates that it's very hard to make non-negligible money on them. Only a very small fraction of your audience will ever give you money. Incidentally, I've heard from those same sources that it's preferable to have a lot of low-paying patrons (or whatever) than a few big ones, so that your revenue stream is smoother. Either way you need a pretty big audience.</p>

If builders and researchers in the community could package their science into small buyables, that could form a really nice market. I am thinking of cheap (say $3 ~ $7) but frequent. For instance, if a (V)PL creator has worked a lot on a particular design/feature/concept, if he could isolate it and wrap it into, say, a markdown with gifs, I would buy a few of these every month, and probably become a collector.  </p>

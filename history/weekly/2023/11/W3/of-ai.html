<p>AFAIK Open AI has a powerful LLM system in large part due to large compute power.</p>
<p>Is there a future where small business / people can compete with mega-corps in the LLM space, or will we be renting GPT (or similar) until end the of time?</p>

As LLMs get bigger and bigger, the computing power grows non-linearly. We may reach a point where general intelligence is "good enough" for most tasks, and then model expansion is deemed uneconomical. We are no where near that point, though.</p>
<p>Startups and individuals are more likely to compete in domain-specific areas that don't require general intelligence and don't benefit from expanded context windows.</p>

<p>So I'm clear, in this future when a model is good enough, can I go ahead &amp; run it myself on my computer? And how does it solve my concern?</p>

<p>On compute requirements, two points:</p>
<ul><li>The bulk of compute is needed for training.</li><li>There is definite economic pressure for training to yield efficient models that can run on phones.</li></ul><p>So I don't think we'll be constrained by laws of physics here, only the laws of geopolitics.</p>

Individual's are currently running FB's open-source model (Llama2) on high-end personal hardware (say $10K) and just waiting for output. If Llama2 is "good enough" for your use case, then give it a few years for the hardware to catch up and allow for near-realtime inference. Look at the advancements in GPUs since the 1990s. Look at how mobile phones have evolved since the first iPhone. I wouldn't bet against similar happening here.  However, in the meantime, companies like OpenAI and Cohere are expanding not only the model sizes but also the "context windows" available to their models. (early 2023: like 32k tokens. today: 100K tokens). They not only have the investment dollars to build out this infrastructure, but they can also monetize that cost over their entire customer base. An individual or small startup is at a huge disadvantage there.</p>

<p>The car which destroyed not just the environment but cities, our cities are significantly less safe, less beautiful, much slower to maneuver, and importantly(!) more expensive. (too much to unpack in a comment, see “not just bikes” if this isn’t clear to you)</p>

<blockquote><p>AI is dangerous, yes, but not for most of the reasons that tend to be discussed.

Which is why discussing "freedom" associated with cars is a complicated story. Cars increase some people's freedom and restrict other people's freedom. Illich argues that such radical monopolies should always be subject to political deliberation, i.e. a society should consciously decide whether it accepts or rejects them.</p>
<p>There's a good chance that AI will become a radical monopoly as well, so all that is quite relevant here. But the existence of an "open" version of the technology probably makes a difference - I'll have to think about that a bit more!</p>

<p>I think this is where the comparison of AI to internet really falls apart.</p>
<p>The promise which falls apart with both AI &amp; cars, is what they mean by "freedom".</p>
<p>What they mean is "freedom from other people", more than anything else. The promise that  <em>I</em>  the individual should be able to create, be, build anything I want without downsides.</p>
<p>With cars, came the suburbs - a mini mansion, a selfish paradise, but I've lost my community, I've grown to be scared of the people in my city. &lt;- importantly we've known for some time that this way of life is horribly unsustainable.</p>
<p>With AI, I can create entire products without interacting with anyone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, to me this is the  <em>least interesting</em>  thing about both cars, and AI.</p>
<p>Cars are great for workers, artists, truly liberating for those who often have a lot of things they need to carry.</p>
<p>Similarly, AI will be good for creatives who have big dreams - maybe one day I could actually make my musical.</p>
<p>BUT  <em>AI will not make people creative</em> , and this is where I see it falling apart.</p>
<p>By the time it's too late, some (not all) will realize not everyone is good at art, music, products, but we'll have no way out.</p>
<p>To make it extra clear, like the car, AI has its place, but it should not become the default way we do product / creative work. We should be careful to not repeat what happened with cars</p>

<p>Sorry I keep harping on this, but  <em>I really don't think so</em> . I think the failure of the internet has deep lessons to offer if you look. Elegant open protocols are not enough, they're just breeding grounds for gnarly proprietary protocols.</p>
<p>The internet too offered freedom, freedom from other people. And it has led to its own suburbs and selfish paradises (lovely phrasing, btw).</p>
<p>Don't discard one cautionary tale to focus on another. All cautionary tales are precious because they form so slowly over time. In the end they're just mirrors reflecting our own selves. We're going to need all the help/mirrors we can get to responsibly husband AI.</p>

<p>I shouldn't be so kind to the internet you're right, but the point I am trying to say is that internet still feels salvageable as a foundation for humanity. Cars are not.</p>
<p>Whether or not my hopes for the internet will manifest is rightly very up for debate, but I think its unique in that it  <em>could be foundation</em>  vs having to largely undo the damage of cars on our cities.</p>

We are happy to shape our tools, with best intentions, but don't notice how our tools are shaping us. There are always individuals who do see it early, and say so loudly, but they are ignored by the enormous majority who remains infatuated with the shiny new tools and doesn't even want to consider that they could do us harm later.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have no idea how to break out of such dynamics.</p>

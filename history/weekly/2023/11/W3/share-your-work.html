So here's a substantive reaction to the post: where does the code for your OS with no apps come from? Do you write it all yourself? Do you expect your goldfish to fill in any gaps themselves?</p>
<p>If you provide any way for new code to enter your OS, how do you keep this third-party code from taking people's calendar and todo list data  <em>out</em>  of your OS? Because if you don't, then they'd take the data out and provide a better experience on their server, and then people would ask you why your OS doesn't provide a web browser, and then you'd give them a web browser, and then they'd live within the web browser where each tab traps their data.</p>
<p>This isn't an insurmountable problem, but it  <em>is</em>  an unsolved problem. There's some discussion about possible solutions:</p>

<p>To be precise, the problem in my mind is this: it's 1996 and we're starting to use computer networks in a big way. What can we do to keep the initial egalitarian distribution of data sinks from agglomerating into giant data black holes (that are by definition unaccountable)?</p>
<p>It's not sufficient to fight the last battle, but here it feels necessary. And I don't think capabilities help in isolation with this problem. I actually have no technical ideas that would help here in the absence of a more thoughtful populace. Technical tools can actually be counter productive by encouraging complacency in people.</p>
<p>I half think we should all just go back to traditional websites. Spread the word: just everybody go seek out websites where you know the operator well, they don't seek VC funding with its incentives to go chase tons of adoption, maybe everyone even has the keys to share and export data, etc. If you can't find one, start one. If you can't start one, wait. That feels like the strong competitor to compare any solution with here. Does any technical solution actually do better if we have this social context? Can it possibly help if we don't have this social context?</p>

<p>The question of sucking data back out and trapping it via hostile code boils down to permissions and choice. Permissions - they can't do it without your permission. Choice - well it's up to you if you want to do that, I'm not stopping you.</p>
<p>Thanks for the links, I'll look at them, apart from the Solid one, which isn't really related. Yes, you have online hosting for your data, which does bring in a little trust element, which I suppose is fine. Plus you have more control over it, which is good. I recall data is in standard types, which is also good.</p>
<p>But there's still the whole "inert, zombie" data aspect - data is lifeless until animated by some app, probably a browser app, which is right back to the same problem of app inscrutability.</p>

<p>It's true that a decentralised database with standard data types - something like Solid/Soup - fixes the issue with apps that they often store stuff in proprietary formats and/or on their hidden databases. Which is a huge win for freeing data.</p>
<p>So imagine a collection of to-dos and a collection of events. And then you have your to-do app and your calendar app, because even though our data is "free", it's still not accessible except through an app.</p>
<p>But now you're juggling apps again, with their idiosyncracies and tendency to want to be THE app for each data type.</p>
<p>But each app has access now to the other's data. So the calendar can reference to-dos and the to-do list can reference events. Indeed, Wikipedia tells me that in Soup: the "calendar could refer to names in the address book; a note in the notepad could be converted to an appointment".</p>
<p>So we've got an odd situation, as you don't need two apps, really. Why not just make the calendar better and better at to-do lists, and notes? Now you get cross-type UX without app-flipping and having to re-learn each app.</p>
<p>This can be extended across the full range of types that Tim BL has in his Pods, or Apple had in their Soups. One app can be used for all data types, giving a cross-type consistent UX experience, where building up data from mashing up different types is core to the experience and designed to be as smooth as possible.</p>
<p>Indeed, if you've only got one app, why not just call it the OS? Which brings you to the Itemized OS idea of Obenauer, and my own OS with no apps.</p>
<p>So Newton's OS could have just skipped the apps and done it this way. And Obenauer could look at building his OS on top of Solid!</p>

<p>Yes this is just a part of the whole, but it all hangs nicely together. Either look out for Part 2 or the existing articles do cover most of it.</p>
<p>The next step after the above is where I move what was the apps' internal logic - the bit where you need an app to "animate" each type of the zombie inert data in the database - into the data objects themselves, so that they become "internally animated".</p>

You want a monolithic application that tries to be everything, badly? The todos and calendar UIs don't need to be apps, they can be components that apps use. Somewhere to store the data, and some UI to manipulate the data. Apps in this sense are just there to glue components together to make a larger, more specific UI.

<blockquote><p>You want a monolithic application that tries to be everything, badly? The todos and calendar UIs don't need to be apps, they can be components that apps use. Somewhere to store the data, and some UI to manipulate the data. Apps in this sense are just there to glue components together to make a larger, more specific UI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want an OS that recognises very common types: little types like to-dos and events and contacts and paragraphs. Then there are two parts: the internal logic of those little types, and the way the OS renders and enables interaction with them. You can build "apps" out of assemblies of all that.</p>
<p>Oh! We agree!</p>
<p>Perhaps the implementation or architecture is where we don't agree. I'm suggesting doing this in a declarative way, not an imperative way. OpenDoc, CORBA, Module Federation, etc., are imperative solutions.</p>
<p>A declarative solution is more like transclusion (iframes, sorta) and being driven by a data-dependency model (observe don't command) all the way from front to back - and sideways to other systems.</p>

<p>The business drivers and imperatives (ha! funny how it's the same word!) wouldn't allow a declarative, app-free solution. Data is the new oil and all that. Which is why the original declarative Web of HTML and later CSS had to be inverted back to a JS-dominated imperative model</p>

<p>Philip Wadler ‚Ä¢ Propositions as Types</p>
<p>íÇ∂ <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/068">futureofcoding.org/episodes/068</a></p>
<p>The subject of this episode‚Äôs paper ‚Äî <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/propositions-as-types/propositions-as-types.pdf">Propositions as Types</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Wadler">Philip Wadler</a> ‚Äî is one of those grand ideas that makes you want to go stargazing. To stare out into space and just disassociate from your body and become one with the heavens.  <em>Everything ‚Äî life, space, time, existence ‚Äî all of it is a joke!</em>  A cosmic ribbing delivered by the laws of the universe or some higher power or, perhaps, higher order. Humanity waited two thousand years, from the time of the ancient Greeks through until the 1930s, for a means to answer questions of calculability, when three suddenly arrived all at once:</p>
<ul><li>General recursive functions by G√∂del in 1934, with functions of sets of natural numbers.</li><li>Lambda calculus by Alonzo Church in 1936, with anonymous single-variable functions.</li><li>Turing machines by Alan Turing in 1937, with a process for evaluating symbols on a tape.</li></ul><p>Then it was discovered that these three models of computation were, in fact, perfectly equivalent. That any statement made in one could be made in the others. A striking coincidence, sure, but not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_discovery">without precedent</a>. But  <em>then</em>  it was quietly determined (in 1934, again in 1969, and finally published in 1980) that computation itself is in a direct correspondence with logic. That every proposition in a given logic corresponds with a type in a given programming language, every proof corresponds with a program, and the simplification of the proof corresponds with the evaluation of the program.</p>
<p>The implications boggle the mind.  <em>How could this be so?</em>  Well, how could it be any other way? Why did it take so long to discover? What other discoveries like this are perched on the precipice of revelation?</p>
<p>Philip Wadler is here to walk us through this bit of history, suggest answers to some of these questions, and point us in a direction to search for more.</p>
<p>And  <em>we</em>  are here, dear listener, to level with you that a lot of this stuff is miserably hard to approach, presented with the symbols and language of formal logic that is so often inscrutable to outsiders. By walking you through Wadler‚Äôs paper (and the much more approachable <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOiZatlZtGU">Strange Loop talk</a>), and tying it in with the cultural context of modern functional programming, we hope you‚Äôll gain an appreciation for this remarkable, divine  <em>pun</em>  that sits beneath all of computation.</p>

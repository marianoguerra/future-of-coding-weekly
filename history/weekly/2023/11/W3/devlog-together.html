For the current version (<a href="https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=94852">love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=94852</a>), my partner led and pushed for preserving L√ñVE primitives. For example, the L√ñVE event loop calls functions you define called  <code>love.draw</code> ,  <code>love.keypressed</code> , etc., and it seems desirable to continue to support those for familiarity's sake. This can seem impossible if the environment is also built in L√ñVE and uses those same functions for providing its infrastructure, but since Lua is a dynamic environment there are tricks to make it work reasonably nicely.</p>
<p>Lately I've been taking the lead on a riff of that project, and I find I'm advocating strongly to  <em>not</em>  do this. I want to define new handlers like  <code>shell.draw</code>  and  <code>shell.keypressed</code>  that programs within my environment will have to call. And I finally figured out why I feel so strongly about this:</p>
<ul><li>L√ñVE has a function to return the bounds of the device/window. You typically can draw between x coordinates 0 and some width. And this information is often used to draw UI elements near the edges and corners. So should we now override functions like  <code>line</code>  to adjust coordinates and keep them in the client area? There's a lot of surface area to cover here. Bugs will inevitably happen, and when they do our attempts to create a seamless abstraction will cause more confusion.</li><li>Ranting more broadly, the desire for a "seamless experience" is a disease. The provider wants to "own the customer relationship," so that the user can forget there's anything in the universe but themselves and the app. Just like a casino. I'd rather not pretend we can wish the universe away with its possibility of errors. Let's me and the user treat each other as grown-ups, and not hide irreducible complexity in our supply chains. Here are the functions I provide, here are the functions L√ñVE provides. I recommend you use my stuff where possible, but you don't have to. Yes, it's confusing. Welcome.</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"><p><img src="http://history.futureofcoding.org/history/msg_files/F06/F065TCK9XS9.png" alt="carousel-shell-mockup.png"></p>

<p>I think that desiring a seamless experience is less a disease than it is a consequence of being a busy grown-up. I would prefer one API to two overlapping APIs, but if you told me that that was too hard, I would understand.</p>

As with health, a key element is developing awareness, for everybody involved. Eating a sweet dessert is OK if it is done consciously, knowing that it should be something exceptional. It's the habit of eating sweet that is bad for health. Likewise, a seamless experience, at the price of agency, is perfectly fine if it remains restricted to appropriate settings, such as watching a movie or playing a game. It reduces agency only if it becomes a priority in digital life.</p>

This is much inspired by flow based programming. But since I want to build a generic visual programming system, I think that it is also important to support different ways.. basic statecharts I already support, but a pull-based system is not yet something that I had build with my system. Until now! .. so in this video you can see how I construct a flow that is used to construct a glsl fragment shader. Here the output node pulls in the data from the node's cominh before it in the flow, so working backwards through a flow. </p>
<p>Although it's not my goal to build a full product around this alone.. a lot better and much more extensive applications already exist for building shaders this way. But still helpful to look at my project from a different perspective, which leads to some refactoring, bug fixing, insights and inspiration.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was really in doubt if this was the right route for this week's time spent on my project because of the awesome demo that tldraw made with gpt4-vision api, very cool! So,I also had to play with it together with my own application and was also amazed with the possibilities! Probably my next video will have this as a topic. Anyway, for now, enjoy my short video where I construct a very simple shader which runs on the GPU via webgl.</p>

A thing that I want to improve is the auto placement of new nodes.. I think that your approach with the "rectangle world" in one your</p>
<p>videos might help, so I am going to try something simular.. I also need ways to create space after nodes have been placed, as you can see in my video... currently too much dragging is needed to create space so that the layout of the nodes gets clearer.</p>

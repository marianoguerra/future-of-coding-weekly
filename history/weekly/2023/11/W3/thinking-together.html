A metadata editor that presented as a nested bulleted list of English sentences with clickable words, like:</p>
<p>‚ÄúFrom [time T1] to [time T2], an [event type] happens with [property P], and it‚Äôs very [adjective].‚Äù</p>
<p>The event descriptions are highly multi-dimensional and resonate well with this information design, though the timestamps suffer a bit. They want to be on a timeline, but I didn‚Äôt have the budget. Despite this, the UI has saved us loads of time and people  ~<em><em>love</em></em>~  the sentence-based configuration compared to the forty-column table of dropdowns they envisioned when I started the project.</p>
<p>The biggest failure was that enforcing a few global constraints was  ~<em><em>also</em></em>~  outside my budget. Lacking those has led to data loss‚Äînever more than a few minute‚Äôs worth, but still. I felt bad. Thankfully, someone else recently picked up the project and will be correcting those omissions.</p>
<p>But we disagreed immediately on how to do it! I thought we should  ~<em><em>present</em></em>~  the errors: ‚ÄúThese events overlap!‚Äù The other person thought we should make the errors impossible: when you edit a timestamp, you implicitly edit all the others that are involved in the constraint.</p>
<p>I generally agree with their approach. I mean, it‚Äôs baked into the rest of the UI. When you change an event type, it changes the rest of the sentence. But if you change the type back, the sentence structure is restored and your previous values all come back. Cascading edits are more destructive than that. They force you to be careful about what you change and to be observant of unintended side-effects.</p>
<p>The block editor problem of representing invalid states is another way to look at it. Sometimes the most efficient path between two valid states passes through an invalid one. If you want to reorder two events, for example, a first step might be to copy the start and end times from one to the other, as part of an ‚Äúa = b; b = oldA‚Äù sequence. They overlap until you‚Äôre done. To do the same without ever breaking global constraints requires user ingenuity or a more featureful editor with a ‚Äúswap events‚Äù button. Requiring user ingenuity wastes a lot of time and energy and happiness over the lifetime of the UI, but observing users and adding features to address every desired editing operation takes a lot of dev time too, and it has to happen  ~<em><em>now</em></em>~ , or else people editing this data will be blocked whenever they find an impossible edit.</p>
<p>Anyway, not too many answers here, but I thought it was an interesting case study, with thought-provoking  ~<em><em>questions</em></em>~  at least!</p>

Like you said, it sucks when one change changes many things. You can mitigate it with undo (which would then be essential), but even so things can change outside your field of view. You now need to be able to visualize everything that changed. There's seldom the budget for that, and probably for the best; I'm sure it'll lead to new problems.</p>
<p>Another reason to prefer lower smarts: Often there are multiple ways to propagate a change to satisfy the constraints. Which one should you choose?</p>

<p>A version of this idea can be seen here with tldraw: <a href="https://twitter.com/mrmkrs/status/1725959207365583196">twitter.com/mrmkrs/status/1725959207365583196</a> where he generates the next more specific interface step off the previous one.</p>
<p>Another I'm kind of using this in my agent framework: <a href="https://github.com/sublayerapp/sublayer/blob/main/lib/sublayer/agents/generate_sublayer_agent_agent.rb">github.com/sublayerapp/sublayer/blob/main/lib/sublayer/agents/generate_sublayer_agent_agent.rb</a> where we generate new agents based off a simple agent template (and works surprisingly well).</p>
<p>I know Hofstatder digs into this concept in GEB and Steve Yegge calls it the <a href="https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/10/universal-design-pattern.html">Universal Design Pattern</a></p>
<p>Does this resonate with anyone here? Is anyone familiar with any other writing about prototype-based modeling/prototypal inheritance/etc for me to take this further?</p>

If you follow me on fedi, you might have seen what I‚Äôm talking about. </p>
<p>The idea is basically this: a conference, in some form, based around the idea of ‚Äúwhat we could have‚Äù, i.e. alternative visions for what computing or infrastructure or whatever could be, with a green, open source, demo focused bent. </p>
<p>Now I have no clue how to organize anything like that, so I‚Äôm asking for y‚Äôall‚Äôs help! Do you know people? Have ideas of how to get funding? Have a talk/workshop/whatever idea? Please reach out to me! </p>

<p>Do you already have an idea about what form the conference could take from that perspective?</p>

It's a massive help. I get it for free because I have enough open-source stars on github or something, but I'd pay for it if I lost that.</p>
<p>I can understand why you'd want to avoid it based on principle reasons though.</p>
<p>Everyone at my work uses it. If someone stopped using it, everyone else would think "why are you making coding harder for yourself."</p>
<p>I know <strong>@Eli Mellen</strong> said they're not looking for judgement of the tool, but to add to what others have said:</p>
<p>I'm very forgetful when it comes to remembering APIs, even my own ones. So it's like autocomplete on steroids. It used to compete with autocomplete, but I've heavily tweaked the settings so that it doesn't. You can fully customise how and when it appears.</p>
<p>I do so much copilot prompting within my editor. "This function downloads an object as a json file". Previously I would look it up on stack overflow.</p>
<p>It's best at writing tests. It made test-writing a lot more fun for me too!</p>
<p>In my personal projects, I've started to keep my code in fewer, bigger files because Copilot seems to behave better when you do that. In my personal projects, it works really well. </p>
<p>It does worse for my job's projects. It tries to use APIs from older versions of tldraw. It must have loads of tldraw version 1 projects in its training data, and it uses that instead of the new version 2 APIs in the repo I'm working in. I've got very good at learning the v1 to v2 equivalents</p>

Copilot hasn't seen very much unison code before.</p>
<p>it used to be that copilot would do okay if you were doing stuff that is weird in unison, like working at the bottom of a file with lots of unison code above you. it would still just think it was supposed to be emitting Haskell.</p>
<p>But in the last couple of months or so it has gotten WAY better at unison code. You no longer need lots of surrounding code, it doesn't have to be specifically above the cursor, but more importantly, copilot has just plain gotten a lot smarter in the last few months, and has  <em>somehow</em>  (not from github checkins) learned unison in the last few months.</p>

<p>I'm way more in the "prototype" than "project" phase... but my goal is to explore some ideas for tools/interfaces/experiences around building and managing these types of things, somewhat in general,  though hopefully with some demos actually working on/with some real systems. So I suppose the answer is a little of both.</p>

<p>I agree in some sense, but also see potential value in hewing close enough to the current state of technical implementation to make specific differences stand out as distinct, since part of my goal is to drive/encourage changes in existing projects vs just building something completely novel.</p>

<p>I love the idea of node-based code, but in practice I've yet to see systems like this that are as readable as well laid-out and formatted code. Don't get me wrong, I think most traditional textual code could be laid out and formatted much better too, but  <em>in general</em>  I find it easier to scan and understand the top-down flow of textual code than nodes.</p>
<p>Maybe I just haven't seen the right tools which do this better? Or maybe I'm in a tiny minority? What do folks here think? (And please forgive me if this conversation has been done to death in this Slack already, I've not seen it.)</p>

But this notion that  <em>the interfaces to existing visual programming tools are dreadfully lacklustre</em> is a significant motivator of my work. In addition to the podcast, I've done <a href="https://github.com/ivanreese/visual-programming-codex/blob/main/impressions/origami.md">some</a> writing <a href="https://github.com/ivanreese/visual-programming-codex/blob/main/impressions/app-store-illustration.md">about</a> these things, and would love to dig into this subject with you.</p>
<p>One quick hit ‚Äî you mentioned "these UIs just leave these problems as exercises for the user, without any automated assistance." I'm strongly of the opinion that, say, force-directed layout of nodes is directionally wrong. But I'm also in favor of assistance. Max/MSP has a couple of "clean up my layout for me" tools, for instance, which are fine on principal but (last I used them ~3 years ago) woefully underdeveloped. I long to see someone take the approach to a visual programming interface that, say, Steve Ruiz took with tldraw, or <strong>@Elliot</strong> took with his carrot editors ‚Äî sweating every tiny detail of the interactions, trying to make something that feels so  <em>right</em> it disappears.</p>

Yeah, this is baffling. Like, the fact that visual programming (at least of the node-wire style) typically takes place in a zoomable canvas ought to be a superpower! Like, zooming out from text code is pretty useful (eg: minimaps, or stuff like Makepad, or in some sense code folding), and that only leverages the  <em>accidental</em>  geometry of the syntax. If you're in a graphical canvas, you should be able to do so much more with the sense of scale.</p>

Arranging nodes is the same. It actually helps me to think and get into the flow. As for zooming out, even if I can't read any labels, I find it easier to read a graph, as I can quickly spot a "neighborhood" and be reminded what I've done there. While a text minimap is less distinct. But you do have to zoom out more often, as nodes are less compact.</p>

<p>I'm not sure about that. I even sympathize with a lot of this from a certain perspective, despite generally disagreeing with most of your conclusions. Not gonna nit-pick everything, but can't resist this one:</p>
<blockquote><p>text-only PLs are, but, 1950‚Äôs caveman IDEs for programming</p>
</blockquote>
<p>yeah, like scratching surfaces with pointy sticks is actual caveman's IDE for writing, yet I still do the same thing every day with a just slightly more advanced pointy stick, and it would still be a loss to leave it behind despite all the newer tools available. üòÑ There's a lot of "horses for courses" in tool selection.</p>
<p>On the overall point; like I said I think I at least understand the thought process when I look at it from the perspective of the art and craft of programming. I feel a lot of The Architect's pride in their craftsmanship coming through in that. But when I look at it from the perspective of the actual trade of writing software... giving the infinite flexibility of The Architect's powerful tools for daily work feels a bit like handing out 12 gauge shotguns to a classroom full of kindergartners to swat a fly. Will they kill it? Sure, but I wouldn't want to see the collateral damage that will come along with that.</p>

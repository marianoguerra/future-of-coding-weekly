Baseline Lua gives nice stacks to show you precisely where an error happened. But as a dynamic language it also gives you tools to try to 'improve' on it, and when I run into problems it's invariably because I was trying to be clever and my improvements like driver.love regress the experience. LÃ–VE is a bit like that as well albeit much more mature than my stuff; it has one issue I've noticed that baseline Lua doesn't have.</p>
<p>I tend to be a debug by print person so haven't played with debuggers like <a href="https://github.com/deltadaedalus/vudu">github.com/deltadaedalus/vudu</a> much. So it might fall to others to review the debugger side of the eco system. But things have seemed decent enough to me.</p>

<p>The debug infrastructure lives on the surface. I frequently tinker with it while debugging.</p>

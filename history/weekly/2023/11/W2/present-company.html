I think the reactive aspect is extremely important to interactive systems. And the data stores I'm considering are relational-ish in nature (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/ccorcos/tuple-database/">tuple-database</a>)</p>
<p>(... well, actually despite being made of tuples it's not really a relational database. But as a primitive it could have a relational layer on top.)</p>

But the ideas of expressing domain logic as relational queries is interesting, as is the separation between input state and derived state. I think the struggles of my system really stem from not strictly distinguishing between input and derived state, so everything becomes a big mess. That's why the paper spoke so clearly to my situation.</p>

So it comes back down to storing history or not, which is down to supporting elements of the system that are behind in the sequence of events and not yet caught up with subsequent changes. But after that, you don't need to store history, and if you do, then you must have a domain requirement to do so, in which case, make it explicit with a history table!</p>
<p>The question is, how do you get to each new state? AST and my squinty-eyed interpretation of tarpit FRP tell me that you have pure domain functions or derivative relations transforming from state to new or next state. I think Clojure's DB has something like that.</p>
<p>As for input vs derived state: well that's an arbitrary distinction, really. I mean, just have derived state as your general model, and then make some state special - inputs - and "derived from something going on elsewhere". Then outputs derive "state elsewhere" from system state. The tarpit called them feeders and observers.</p>

I could narrate it myself, but hate the sound of my own voice, so maybe not. Either someone who does it in their sleep and can help me for a fee maybe, or some really really good software. I need to animate shapes doing things in a cartoony way, with sound effects. Quite 3D-ish probably. 🤗 Budget sub-$1000. Running time 1-2m</p>

<p>c) maybe look into Descript’s stock AI voices and “overdub”.  I’m definitely into DIY, but, YMMV.  If I hated the sound of my own voice, but wanted to put the video together myself, I would use Kinopio to rough-in a script, ChatGPT to flesh out the script and Descript’s stock voices to read my script over screenshots/video/Powerpoint.  Again, this is the way that I think of DIYing a video, but, if you want to hire out, this doesn’t apply.</p>

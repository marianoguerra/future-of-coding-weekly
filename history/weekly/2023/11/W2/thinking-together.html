<p>I'm about to do a bit of research on this topic but thought I'd start here.</p>
<p>Off the dome I can think of excel (numerical constraints) and rhino grasshopper (architectural / physical constraints).</p>
<p>I realize this is vague, but what I have in mind is a UI that allows for constraints to be defined which are then composed together and solved behind the scenes.</p>
<p>In particular, I'm wondering how to represent the case where there are multiple valid solutions and offer cycling through them to the user.</p>

I don't have anything I can show yet, but I'll talk about some stuff that's relevant here.</p>
<p>George mentioned parametric CAD, and that's an excellent example. I'd also point to video games ‚Äî&nbsp;the way their physics engines work is often quite similar to a constraint solver, and the "UI" over the solver is the game itself. Some games like World of Goo or the new Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom expose the constraint system quite directly as a core part of the gameplay. I'd also point to artistic 3D modelling tools, which differ a bit from CAD in that the interface(s) to the constraint system(s) are more focused on creative expression (eg: "make this thing 'look at' that thing") rather than precision (eg: "make the angle between these two lines 90¬∫").</p>
<p>For the part where you're wondering about multiple valid solutions, I think it depends on how continuous vs discrete your domain feels. If it's very continuous, you might want some of the approaches in Bret Victor's essay <a href="http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/">Ladder of Abstraction</a>. If it's more discrete, check out the Ink &amp; Switch essay <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/untangle/">Untangle</a>.</p>
<p>I hope that helps. Feel free to ask for more examples or more explanation of anything I referenced.</p>

If you can picture the latent space that artifacts are drawn from by queries (going through the constraint solver), that can help to discover something cleverer.</p>
<p>Tbh, I'm abusing heatmap here to describe density distributions of artifacts in latent space (to be accessed by drilling down, although the selection can be multiple) - not the uniform parameter grid that Victor shows, although that could be understood as the empty query.</p>
<p>(I'm assuming you do want to mingle phase space with parameter space - rather than animating the constraint like in Zelda, or building it into the user's brushes like in CAD, if I understand.)</p>

<p>As with many areas in academia, the literature is overflowing with great ideas but I'm frustrated by the lack of a stable platform by which to compare and contrast the various approaches and expose them to non-expert users - one of the goals of this project is to reach towards a 'productization' of such research.</p>

I also find them often low in information density, and complex code can get very difficult to understand. I'm very curious to hear your thoughts on that, if you'd be inclined to share them.</p>

I do still like to refer to what's written with Levlo as "Levlo code" too. I'd just point out that natural English does have if/else and mathematical operators when used in specific domains. The operators could easily be replaced with words in Levlo, but I thought it'd be unnecessarily verbose.</p>
<p>Initially the idea is to target use-cases where a custom UI is not necessary (such as spreadsheet use-cases), however you'll be able to hide parts of the code and apply some styling to end up with a form UI. You can also host your Levlo App as a REST API so that it takes some of the inputs as query parameters and returns some of the computed values as results. This would allow you to build a completely custom UI for the logic implemented with Levlo.</p>

<p><a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~brianhempel/">Brian Hempel</a> it does have ToonTalk vibes, happy to hear you find the idea compelling!</p>
<p>For many years I tried to find something similar to "beings" as the personification of processes. (I still haven't found it). Then at some point it occurred to me that maybe I can ask Alan Kay himself if he knows of anything like it, explaining the idea along the way. If I recall correctly I heard him claim in a couple of talks that most of the things have been invented in 80s or something along those lines. So I thought, well, let's put it to a test! To my surprise he replied back and pointed out Ken Kahn's ToonTalk. It is indeed done in a similar spirit, but not quite. The closest thing to beings in ToonTalk I would say are "robots", but they can't be controlled directly as beings can. They have a more specific role, not as general as beings. Like you say, there are many metaphors in Toontalk and it gets confusing because of that.</p>
<p>Interesting that you had an association with the Program Counter. What part of the article made you bring it up?</p>

<p>Good question, the future examples will make that more clear. The anonymous function has a definition, which maps to a space, and even though it is "anonymous" it is still possible to point to it one way or another. I think the "portal -&gt; function name" is confusing, I need to change it to "portal -&gt; pointer to a function". Does that make it more clear?</p>

The most straightforward is your first suggestion, but the challenge is maintaining a consistent state. Macros are recorded with a "recording context", or an example of the parameters needed to run the macro (e.g. a single row of a table). But once you introduce conditionals, those parameters might not be valid for all branches (e.g. update if a record exists, insert if it doesn't).</p>
<p>So one option is to prompt the user to choose a different context (e.g. pick a different row).</p>
<p>Another option is more in line with your second suggestion (took us longer to come up with it, though :)). The user records a macro for a single context, then we alert them to a failure or possible failure for other contexts (not always possible, but usually is), and then they record a separate macro for that context.</p>
<p>This is more in line with classic "Programming by Example" systems such as the one described by Bret Victor (<a href="http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/">worrydream.com/MagicInk</a>), where multiple examples are provided and the system tries to generalize.</p>

<p>This approach fails. Just have the user write the branch condition explicitly.</p>

<p>I agree it won't work in all cases, but we think there might be common patterns that will get us pretty far.</p>

<p>Maybe Eager did this? It sounds okay. But what you don‚Äôt want to do is implicitly try to infer the branch condition.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve seen many PBD systems and the amount of work to demonstrate to try to get the branch condition is very much greater than the amount of work to just say the branch condition.</p>

<p>Are you aware of any PBD systems that only record explicit actions? All of the research projects I'm familiar with try to do an "observe and infer" approach, which I agree is too fragile.</p>

Design is something that you just need to internalize, and look at lots and lots of other designs and see what speaks to you. Sometimes you don't know why a design looks so nice until you break it apart. Then you can use that information to build your own.</p>

"I barely know how to use a mouse. What am I looking at, what should I do?". Another is using realistic, long text in designs. If you use short ones like "genre", you'll find later that nothing fits. One more thing is you can blur the design to get a feeling of weight and hierarchy. If you can generally understand the hierarchy (without clearly seeing the text or images), it's good.</p>

For example, you can create a "wizard" style with next and back buttons, or you can create one single page with the code floating on the right side of the content (possibly sticky). One detail is that each example would grow in size (for the complete code), but would only focus on one sub-section. I thought about collapsing sections already covered, but being able to expand them, or just have a single button to expand all the hidden code. Has anyone had experience or have seen articles that use a "build from small to large", showing code along the way?</p>

Yes, it has a similar format and I like the build-ups. To support "visual diff" and code folding, I think I'll add Markdown code comments at the end of the line. Maybe something like:</p>
<pre><code>NumericLiteral                  // &gt;

  = value:[0-9]+ {

      return {

        type: 'NumericLiteral', // +

        value: Number(text())   // +

      };

    }</code></pre><p>GitHub Markdown support adding + and - to the beginning of the line, but I want to be able to support other hints, maybe tooltips for example.</p>

<p>Could also periodically have the LLM generate a bunch of simple examples with descriptions, for quick tutorial browsing. Conveniently, these would update as your docs and APIs do. It's possible the docs themselves could be autogenerated...</p>

I started the tutorial and put myself into "ignorant mode", trying not to anticipate anything. That got me stuck at the point shown in the attached picture. Why is the string shown in red and in double quotes on the stage, if it's blue and in single quotes in the source editor and in the explanatory text?</p>
<p>Also: "They evaluate to 'hello'" isn't very useful as an explanation to me. First of all, "evaluate" is a transitive verb in non-technical English. But even if I accept its CS usage, the sentence seems to claim that all Text evaluates to "hello".</p>

Thrilled to share the open beta launch of MightyMeld, a visual dev tool for React I've been building with some friends of mine. <a href="https://www.mightymeld.com/">mightymeld.com</a></p>
<p>Just posted this blog post telling the story and why I'm excited -- <a href="https://mightymeld.com/blog/open-beta">mightymeld.com/blog/open-beta</a></p>
<p>Would love to hear your thoughts! I'm a former academic who's been driven into industry out of a desire to make the theoretical practical. MightyMeld is a "visual coding" that is not like any kind of "visual coding" i would've imagined if we hadn't've built this thing starting from real production code and saying "how can we make this more visual".</p>

But they're not OO objects, they're data chunks that are "internally animated", so the inverse of OO objects which are method-wrapped data.</p>

<p>Yes, a lamp knows that if it's linked ("wired") to a presence sensor it does one behaviour, if linked to a switch, another, if a dimmer, another. So probably hardcoded behaviours cos they're kinda obvious. Then user-written rules for the less obvious ones, or custom stuff like the delays.</p>
<p>You could have nodes-and-wires style, or Unix-pipes style, if you like, but it's not essential. Whatever is most expressive.</p>
<p>Yes, picking up stuff (by grabbing their links) as you travel, and then reusing them back home is certainly what I have in mind!</p>
<p>I knew about Urbit a while back, but like many, I was put off by the politics! However, I've since become non-political, or maybe something more like an anarchist! So yes, I'll go back and see how far they've come over the last four years or so.</p>

The concept example: A specific person might be a node in the infinite knowledge graph. Putting it in the context of a list, in the context of a 2d surface of certain size and viewing distance, may result in contact cards; put them in a 3d wallet may show as "physical" business cards, sending one to the full page printer may print a CV... Problem is... many permutations... hard-coding behaviors not scalable. Need way to dynamically adapt for each situation (combination of data slices and the context), with seamless ways of guiding it closer the the desired intention. For this, the computer needs to be included in the work, and given the relevant knowledge and agency to handle it.</p>

Even reading the mind might not be enough, as the right language gives you the mental clarity in the first place. AI solutions could still guess well, and gather own experience... but if we want to include the human... Even without, the AIs themselves need inter-communication and clarity of thought. I'm proposing work towards a system facilitating such. A system where the current grunt-work of software development isn't applicable anymore, because of different abstraction levels and perspective. A system where the freedom and flow of creation and collaboration is found at yet a higher level.</p>

However, there's no need to do a different render for 2D and 3D: it'll be the same one. I'm thinking neuomorphic in both. (It's using Vulkan for both, underneath.)</p>
<p>You wouldn't get a CV if you printed it, no, you'd have to jump the link from the contact card to the person's CV. If you were viewing the contact in 2D, then expanded the embedded link to the CV - seen as a smaller panel inside the contact, then hit "print", you'd get what you saw, with the CV.</p>
<p>So yes, there's both some hard coding of behaviours of objects, and a default render of any standard recognised object type. But you can extend both.</p>
<p>You suggest AI help for programming? And working at a higher conceptual level? I've probably over-summarised your point, so apologies there. So, I'm not working on AI or AI-to-human, etc., conceptual languages, except the programming language is declarative so intended to be humane, unlike imperative ones. It's what I call a "Domain and Target Independent Language" that is meant to be general purpose and conceptually intuitive without being Nat Lang.</p>

<p>Yes, any human-cognition-aligned notation for data and rules will also be AI-aligned, one would hope!</p>
<blockquote><p>Exactly! If the contact card needs a link to the CV, where is the data!? Eg. the name, and profile picture? Are they both linked in each, or duplicated? If linked to the person entity/node, RDF style or similar; then can the CV not be a virtual construct from available info in the graph, with possibility to override the heuristics on a case by case basis if needed, or even better, update the heuristics to facilitate improved CV's all over?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Duplication is frowned upon: it's all links. So yes, you'd build your CV from bits all over the place, a photo from here, a company logo and blurb from the company's collections, etc.</p>
<p>Not sure what you mean by "heuristics", though?</p>
<blockquote><p>Eg. obsidian style, is the card and the cv separate but linked .md files, with info duplicated; or is each property atomic, and related rather than linked, such that a generic CV view could be shown? Auto adjusting with time?</p>

<p>Card and CV separate and linked, yes, of course. No dupes. Not sure what you mean with the "atomic", "related", "generic", "auto adjusting" bits though!?!?</p>

All our data will be out there still, so as long as you have an API to those photos on Google, you'll be up and running! Things like email and the static web, and many chat applications, can be brought in to the Object Network. Anything that allows data to be grabbed (and shoved!) - via a protocol or a filesystem. I could even (reluctantly!) allow for old fashioned apps to be rendered in-world, starting with (and maybe ending with!) a browser.</p>
<p>But I'm currently seeing the project as a "Lab" for Proof-of-Concept work, where I don't need to make any compromises such as that. I recently let go of any hope that anyone would be using it any time soon, to be honest! But things like blockchain stuff and Urbit, even though I'm not a big fan of either, do give me hope that completely new things can gain traction.</p>

<p>What I see as the mistake in the Smalltalk approach (and many others) is the idea of a single universal computational paradigm that applies from integer addition and string manipulation to user-level interactions.</p>

And I do think that declarative is the "model for everything" that works from low-level data transformations up to user interactions. I think Nat Lang's imperative constructs actually cause confusion here. When I say "mow the lawn!" in an imperative holler, what I'm actually doing is expressing an intention for a goal state. And I won't be satisfied until I see that state to my expectation. I have a corny phrase from back in my REST days: "intention puts the system in tension". I know, a bit cringy. But while the state isn't manifest, that tension remains, and can be communicated further: "haven't you done that bloody lawn yet??"</p>

<ul><li>I hear lots of (boring, robotic) repetition - yawn</li><li>I hear your voice add some vibrato, which makes the vocal part more interesting, and that addition of vibrato didn‚Äôt use arroost (your vocals remind me of David Sylvian‚Äôs voice on ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs Monkey‚Äù and just about everything on ‚ÄúThe First Day‚Äù)</li><li>I hear perfect rhymes ‚Äúdown‚Äù and ‚Äúclown‚Äù - yawn.</li></ul><p>FYI - what I think I learned about songwriting:... any artform - songs, movies, books, etc. - needs to create tension then (maybe) to resolve the tension.  Like playing a Dsus4 chord followed by a D chord.</p>
<p>You can create tension on many levels, e.g. melody, chords, lyrics, phrasing, song structure (AABB vs. ABBA vs. ...), line lengths, numbers of bars, rhyming, etc., etc.</p>
<p>A ‚Äúgreat song‚Äù (a ‚Äúgreat work of art‚Äù) creates tension and release on many levels.  You can keep coming back to it and hear new things every time. Not just in repeated listens, but on a time-scale of decades.  Simplicity is ‚Äúlack of nuance‚Äù, hence, complexity ‚Äúcontains nuance‚Äù.  Great works of art appear to be simple, but, have subtle nuance that can be gleaned by repeated study - i.e. layered.  Average art is either simple or nuanced, but, not both.  Flat, not layered.</p>
<p>From a lyric perspective,  <em>perfect rhymes</em>  imply perfect balance, ‚Äúclosure‚Äù and ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù.   <em>Imperfect rhymes</em>  imply imbalance (and, sadness, confusion, longing, etc.).  For perfect rhymes, I use <a href="http://rhymezone.com">rhymezone.com</a>, for imperfect rhymes I use <a href="http://b-rhymes.com">b-rhymes.com</a>.  My goto is <a href="http://b-rhymes.com">b-rhymes.com</a>.  It gives me 100 possibilities, and causes my mind to wander (‚Äúbrainstorming‚Äù).   The music that you‚Äôve created with arroost is ‚Äúunstable‚Äù, and, IMO, perfect rhymes don‚Äôt fit in with that theme.</p>
<p>[FYI - example.  I always loved McCartney‚Äôs song ‚ÄúYesterday‚Äù.  I tried for decades, but, could never play it and sing it.  Then someone (Pat Pattison) pointed out to me that the verse has only 7 bars, not 8.  My Engineering mind tried to force singing the song as if it had 8 bars.  7 bars makes the song sound ‚Äúsadder‚Äù and prevents Engineers, like me, from cloning it.]</p>

<p>Not that I'm aware of. It's just a fun toy for playing with sound and thinking about time. If you give it a bit of patience and make a few attempts, you'll arrive at something that  ~<em><em>at least</em></em>~  passes the John Cage bar of "music", if not something that my 70-yo parents or 4-yo daughter might recognize as music.</p>

<p>the puzzle side of it is a huge part of the design. it's intentionally difficult! and it's intended to be provocative, to illicit positive (and negative) reactions. Thank you all for participating so far, this is way better than I imagined :)</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/duncancragg">Duncan Cragg</a> pipewire is excellent linux feature which transformed it's previous mess of audio stack into something fantastic.. it lets you easily plug one app into another. Third party equivalents on mac are blackhole and soundflower, on windows I think there is something called virtual cables.</p>
<p>Funky Drummer is a heavily sampled track by James Brown <a href="https://www.whosampled.com/James-Brown/Funky-Drummer/">whosampled.com/James-Brown/Funky-Drummer</a></p>
<p>You can listen to a famous breakbeat from it full of James Brown grunts here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GACNpJfzyjs">youtube.com/watch?v=GACNpJfzyjs</a></p>
<p>A 'break beat' is basically a sample taken from a drum solo in a classic track like this.. Many musical genres and dance music subcultures have been built on them.</p>
<p>Breakbeat slicing is where you cut up a breakbeat and reassemble it in a different order. Done a lot in e.g. drum n bass. Here's a code example breaking one into eight pieces and playing them in a different order, with pattern transformations:</p>
<p><a href="https://strudel.cc/?hOrzeGQ4Qj0T">strudel.cc/?hOrzeGQ4Qj0T</a></p>
<p>By feedback I meant instead of using external audio input, I recorded audio from the audio that arroost was already playing.. This got noisy quickly. Whole musical genres are based on this technique too..</p>

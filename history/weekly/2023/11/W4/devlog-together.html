<p>They invited 3 researchers. One of them dropped out from the program when they joined a research lab. (Hey wait ‚Äî that was me!) The other two researchers work highly independently. But, when they write a new note, or record a demo video, they share it in a private I&amp;S discord channel so that other folks at the lab can offer feedback. These researchers also sometimes join the weekly Monday+Friday staff calls so they can briefly share what they're up to, just to keep the rest of the lab up to date. The residence is not paid, and the primary benefit (so far) is that you get to use the lab staff as "study buddies" so to speak.</p>
<p>In short, it's basically like a smaller, less casual version of what we already do with <strong>#devlog-together</strong>, <strong>#two-minute-week</strong>, and <strong>#share-your-work</strong>.</p>
<p>There's no always-on video calls that people drop in and out of. There's no obligation for anyone at the lab to give feedback. Quite the opposite ‚Äî it's an opportunity for these researchers to write a regular series of short notes, and record short demos, and share them with a small group of other people who have enough context to be able to offer valuable feedback if they have any. It entirely depends on the researchers putting in the extra effort to make their work legible, interesting, and quickly digestible (which is good practice). It depends on the researchers having the free (unpaid) time to do all this work.</p>
<p>All that being said, if a small group of you would like to commit to each other that you'll regularly communicate your work in a way that makes it legible and quickly digestible, I'd be happy to spin up a channel for it. It'd be a dedicated space where you'd share and discuss your work with each other, and the rest of the community could sort of observe at a remove and perhaps toss in a bit of feedback if they ever had any.</p>
</div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2023-11-25T18:26:26.613Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Ivan Reese</span> <a href="./?fromDate=2023-11-22&amp;toDate=2023-11-28&amp;channel=devlog-together&amp;filter=#2023-11-25T18:26:26.613Z" class="date">2023-11-25 18:26:26</a> <div class="message"><p>It's worth pointing out that these researchers (Mary Rose Cook and Alexander Obenauer) already have a large, highly-engaged following for their work. They've already figured out how to present their work in a way that attracts interest, and they put in a lot of work to maintain that interest. The residence is not, like, a built-in audience. So if we set something up here, I urge you to not expect to get any more traction than your work already gets elsewhere in the Slack. It will get  <em>less</em>  traction, and that's the point ‚Äî you're narrowing your audience to a small handful of people, so that you can speak directly to them. They're not under any obligation to respond, but hey, if a few of you strike up a good rapport that'd be fantastic. But the rest of the community almost certainly won't engage as much as they would if you continue to use the existing channels.</p>
<p>(I'm adding all this couching and hand-wringing because, Duncan, you often complain about people not engaging with things here. So I want to very clearly dissuade you from looking at this idea as a way to bolster engagement.)</p>

<p>So I'm a bit confused about your very long comment - I was just asking if you thought my idea was a runner! I'm picking up that it wouldn't be all that welcome overall.</p>

It's quite powerful .. the created nodes can receive and visualize input data from another node. This is offcourse inspired by makeitreal from tldraw which uses gpt4-vision-preview. I have been playing with the prompt to get the result that I wanted, although the results are not consistent when recreating the html using the same prompt. Still, very cool that this is possible.</p>

<p>The problem: I do this snazzy initial animation (see video) that takes in the whole thing before zooming back in somewhere. That animation works by drawing the whole surface to an in-memory canvas before transforming it. Turns out drawing to a canvas still uses the video card, and I don't have enough video RAM for a virtual "monitor" of this resolution.</p>
<p>[1] Or spread out enough. It's not really about lines of code, just how much area the code occupies.</p>

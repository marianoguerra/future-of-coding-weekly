You get some log output that might or might not have references to the correct file locations.</p>
<p>I don't see any reason, in the long term, why humans would be better than machines at debugging. How to make that happen? I assume somebody is building this already. Would it help if an AI with a large context window + access to the VM could see the whole call logs/tree and see exactly what is going on?  AI could learn from other users, see everything that happens in a run without debugger/console.logs, try multiple solutions in parallel, and fix issues while you sleep.</p>
<p>Thoughts on this?</p>

<p>Leaving aside truly trivial bugs, I think in the majority of cases I work, finding the fix will take me noticeably longer than understanding why a candidate fix works.

The open question here seems to be about AI "pragmatics" in the sense of <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Semantics_vs_pragmatics">en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Semantics_vs_pragmatics</a>. Perhaps I'm airing incompetence here, but I seldom check my coworkers'  <em>logic</em>  in PRs. I mostly check product concerns (are we building the right thing?), process concerns (e.g. are the right things documented?) and architecture (does this PR change roughly the places I would expect?). For logic we rely on tests, and I build up trust over time in the people (entities) I work with (or give feedback to try to gain trust).</p>
<p>I worry that an AI might be good at slipping through these heuristics of mine while performing its (automated or manual) tests in an antagonistic manner. Will it share my values and those of the broader culture I'm embedded in? Can I build up confidence over time that it shares my values, the way I can for the people I work with. Perhaps I'm still prejudiced because I don't live cheek by jowl with AIs yet üòÖ</p>

<p>I think about this a lot, how we are usually limited to the sense of sight when coding. Unlike trying to fix a machine or figure out a problem IRL, we can‚Äôt feel our way to shift and steer the code out of the snowbank. We can‚Äôt listen to the sounds of loose parts rattling around in the code while debugging. </p>

<p>For a I wouldn‚Äôt say I usually check my coworkers‚Äô logic adversarially, but I usually take time to see ‚Äúdo I see how this fixes the bug.‚Äù More often than not I can tell quickly‚Äînot to the point that I‚Äôm sure there are no errors, but I usually get the gist of the change. When I don‚Äôt, I tend to ask, because it‚Äôs an opportunity to document/clarify.</p>

So at minimum you need a human providing a more detailed bug description than "it's not working. you know, the thingy" (dramatized version of real bug reports).

I am not sure there is a way to judge the claim without actually investing some serious efforts to gain personal experience. But it's one of those ideas that, in the end, you wonder how you ever did without. I have had only a few similar experiences in 40 years of using computers: live development, Lisp macros, immutability, version control, and most recently functional package managers. All of these have changed the way I apply computing technology to solve real-world problems (meaning problems that do not come from the computing technology itself).</p>

<p>We're so used now to having an OS with apps, that it's weird to think of OS-level transitions (login-&gt;shell), inter-apps transitions (shell-&gt;vi) and inside-app transitions (vi's command&lt;-&gt;append modes) as similar things. üôÉ</p>
<p>But to a user new to computers, yes these are all "modes".</p>

<p>This is more-or-less what made me accept (and still sometimes hate) the web as a platform. There are no (all that useful) UI standards, but there is a  <em>ton</em>  of room for UI innovation.</p>
<p>Hard to tell if it is worth the usability cost, or how much we ought to be making user interface experiments on unwitting users.</p>

<p>Are you thinking of something similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDoc">OpenDoc</a>? (I'll have to read through your link in more detail later.)</p>

<p>But personally I'm in the camp of "give 90% of the users something simple, consistent and effective for 90% of their needs, but allow extension for edge cases and those difficult ones (like me!)" If you don't have apps at all, then you're kinda forced into cross-datatype interaction consistency. Which is good IMHO.</p>
<p>And yes, "itemized" is (part of) the future! There's another thread talking about Obenauer's stuff just now.</p>
<p>And exactly as you say, it's also the past - the TBL Web didn't have "apps" like today's web pages have. Today, each page is not really part of a seamless web any more.</p>

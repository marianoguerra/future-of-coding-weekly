<p>When I add text in a Coda document, I might consider it Data (to be ignored, or swapped with a placeholder) or UI (to be treated as part of the App Logic). Coda, at present, can't tell the difference.</p>
<p>I mention it here because the need to fork and then merge logic back to the original is likely to come up pretty quicky.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>One software analogue I‚Äôd apply here are creating different environments of an application ‚Äì for ex. a staging/QA environment and a production environment for a web app. Keeping them in sync is made possible by versioning schema changes (of the code and the database) separately.</p>
<p>This does imply making the separation between schema and data explicit (i.e presentation and everything else). Many more things depend on this separation. The hard bit is to do it in a way that requires little upfront commitment from users.</p>

<p>I have been thinking about having 3 zoom levels:</p>
<ul><li>Level 1: Only colors for both types &amp; functions</li><li>Level 2: Colors and names for types, functions and parameters</li><li>Level 3: Shows the entire source file (maybe with some extra color sugar on top?)</li></ul><p>Here are a couple of screenshots of level 1 &amp; 2, and video of the WIP interface.</p>
<p>PS. Anyone have good recommendations of typescript codebases with a couple dozen source code files which I can use for testing?</p>

Grouping the types (containers / records / unions..) doesn't really make that much sense. So you just end up using up all colors.. starving the UI of any usable colors. Maybe a better approach is being able to highlight a certain type, and that one is colored throughout the program.</p>

Philip Wadler ‚Ä¢ Propositions as Types
íÇ∂ <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/068">https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/068</a></p>
<p>The subject of this episode‚Äôs paper ‚Äî &lt;<a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/propositions-as-types/propositions-as-types.pdf|Propositions">https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/propositions-as-types/propositions-as-types.pdf|Propositions</a> as Types&gt; by &lt;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Wadler|Philip">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Wadler|Philip</a> Wadler&gt; ‚Äî is one of those grand ideas that makes you want to go stargazing. To stare out into space and just disassociate from your body and become one with the heavens. <em>Everything ‚Äî life, space, time, existence ‚Äî all of it is a joke!</em> A cosmic ribbing delivered by the laws of the universe or some higher power or, perhaps, higher order. Humanity waited two thousand years, from the time of the ancient Greeks through until the 1930s, for a means to answer questions of calculability, when three suddenly arrived all at once:
‚Ä¢ General recursive functions by G√∂del in 1934, with functions of sets of natural numbers.
‚Ä¢ Lambda calculus by Alonzo Church in 1936, with anonymous single-variable functions.
‚Ä¢ Turing machines by Alan Turing in 1937, with a process for evaluating symbols on a tape.
Then it was discovered that these three models of computation were, in fact, perfectly equivalent. That any statement made in one could be made in the others. A striking coincidence, sure, but not &lt;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_discovery|without">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_discovery|without</a> precedent&gt;. But <em>then</em> it was quietly determined (in 1934, again in 1969, and finally published in 1980) that computation itself is in a direct correspondence with logic. That every proposition in a given logic corresponds with a type in a given programming language, every proof corresponds with a program, and the simplification of the proof corresponds with the evaluation of the program.
The implications boggle the mind. <em>How could this be so?</em> Well, how could it be any other way? Why did it take so long to discover? What other discoveries like this are perched on the precipice of revelation?
Philip Wadler is here to walk us through this bit of history, suggest answers to some of these questions, and point us in a direction to search for more.
And <em>we</em> are here, dear listener, to level with you that a lot of this stuff is miserably hard to approach, presented with the symbols and language of formal logic that is so often inscrutable to outsiders. By walking you through Wadler‚Äôs paper (and the much more approachable &lt;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOiZatlZtGU|Strange">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOiZatlZtGU|Strange</a> Loop talk&gt;), and tying it in with the cultural context of modern functional programming, we hope you‚Äôll gain an appreciation for this remarkable, divine <em>pun</em> that sits beneath all of computation.</p>

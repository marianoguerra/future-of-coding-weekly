<p>They fail as programming languages, which is what most new programming languages do.</p>

But I also think they  ~fail~  don't fulfil their potential in other regards.</p>
<ul><li>They fail at visual communication. Some visualize data types (common in block-based). Some visualize complex control flow (common in node-wire). Some visualize runtime state (common in state charts). Few give the programmer any choice in the matter. None (that I've seen) let the programmer build their own visual affordances in the editing environment. None meaningfully use animation.</li><li>They fail at interactive communication. Some are structural, preventing invalid program configurations (blocks). Some use interaction as part of the programming process (PbD/PbE). Some use tight cycles that approach the sensation of dialectic (fast TDD). None give you the flexibility to define what interaction ought to mean as part of the activity of programming (though some GPT experiments are verging on this). None meaningfully use theatre.</li></ul><p>It's easier to make a  <em>mediocre</em> textual programming language than it is to make a  <em>mediocre</em>  visual one. I imagine the same would be true if one wanted to make a  <em>good</em>  visual programming tool â€” but I don't think anyone has done that yet, so I can't say for certain :)</p>

Somehow our brains are able to blend visual and symbolic thinking into one coherent model, but how that's pulled off remains a mystery.</p>

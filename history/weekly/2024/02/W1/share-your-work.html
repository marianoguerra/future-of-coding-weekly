<p>Author(s): Otto, Jasmine Tan | Advisor(s): Smith, Adam M | Abstract: Software instruments are intelligent interfaces used by domain experts to manipulate complex artifacts. By contributing the concept of software instruments, this thesis connects the field of data visualization to its relations in both artificial intelligence and computer-supported collaborative work. Software instruments arise from projects carried out by teams with complex datasets in aerospace and narrative design, whom I have worked closely with, and which are developed and documented in this thesis. They are a lens for other computational media practitioners to introspect about their own design processes and artifacts. I argue that the evaluation of software instruments occurs in discussion with expert stakeholders, adopting the lens of critical technical practice to avoid disciplinary silos and narrow strategies of evaluation.</p>

<p>We just open sourced this concept we've been working on for programming with LLMs we're calling Blueprints. It is kind of an alternative to coding copilots. It allows you to capture patterns/sections/chunks/classes/etc of your code to store as a "blueprint" then use those blueprints as a base template for generating something new - in your particular style. Think about it similarly to how when you work on a new feature, a lot of the time there's similar code in your codebase that you look at and modify for this new use case you're working on.</p>
<p>The way it works is that when you capture a blueprint, the server generates a description with GPT4 along with vector embeddings of that description so that the next time you want to do something you just need to describe it, it finds the closest description, and uses the description+code to prompt for the new code generation.</p>
<p>Would love feedback or to chat if this sounds interesting to anyone!</p>

Here's a concrete example: for infrastructure-as-code (i.e. Terraform), a prompt could serve as a sketch for an architecture: "I want a web service in Azure connected to a serverless function via an API gateway", for example. Imagine blueprints for each of those major abstractions (web service, serverless function, API gateway) that could be combined automatically by the LLM. Not sure how close we are to that, but it would be very cool to see in action!</p>

I'm working towards a library for rendering and adding direct-manipulation to infinite recursive things. I want to share this picture showing where I'm at.</p>
<p>On the left is the rendered infinite recursive thing. On the right is the diagrammatic specification for the thing on the left. The library interprets the diagrammatic spec and produces a program that takes the initial transformation (position, rotation, scale, and skew) of a shape (data for a  <code>t</code>  in the diagram), and then runs forever, adding more shapes to the left and the right as it runs.</p>
<p>The arrows in the spec mean "depends on", and the lines mean "depends on" both ways. I could have drawn the lines as two-sided arrows but I found that it was harder to read. Explaining this now I realize its kind of confusing tho lol.</p>
<p>The self-loop on the  <code>t</code>  in the spec is what makes the resulting diagram recursive, otherwise it would be a single red, green, and blue thing.</p>
<p>Currently the diagrammatic spec is actually specified in text üòê</p>

The way things are specified is related to functional reactive programming/observables. For an example, the  <code>basis</code>  data is made out of  <code>red</code>  and  <code>blue</code>  vector data. If the  <code>red</code>  or  <code>blue</code>  vector data changes, then that causes the  <code>basis</code>  data to change.</p>

The funky thing about the library is that the classes can be related to themselves, and that's how you get recursion. For example,  <code>t</code>  is related to  <code>basis</code>  and  <code>origin</code>  (its made out of those two pieces of data joined together) and  <code>t</code>  is related to itself. So you get recursive copies of  <code>t</code>  and everything it is related to.</p>

Would anyone be interested in an FoC book club?</p>
<p>Here's what I'm thinking for structure (but very open to suggestions):</p>
<ul><li><em>What:</em>  Read and discuss books about the history and future of programming, e.g. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/722412.The_Dream_Machine">The Dream Machine</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/581700.A_Small_Matter_of_Programming">A Small Matter of Programming</a></li><li><em>When:</em>  One hour meeting every other month on Zoom to discuss one book. Time TBD (timezones could be hard)</li><li><em>How:</em>  Anyone can nominate a book. Vote via Slack poll in <strong>#reading-together</strong> (or perhaps a new, dedicated channel)</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div> <div class="replies"><div id="2024-01-29T21:44:50.395Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Pete Millspaugh</span> <a href="./?fromDate=2024-01-26&amp;toDate=2024-02-01&amp;channel=present-company&amp;filter=#2024-01-29T21:44:50.395Z" class="date">2024-01-29 21:44:50</a> <div class="message"><p>I'm thinking if we have 10-15+ thumbs up on this message that's a critical mass. Could also nominate essays in addition to books!</p>

I didn't make a poll yet‚ÄîI wanted to gauge interest first then we can make a channel, start a nominations thread, open a poll, etc.</p>
<p>I'm thinking we give it a week or so for folks to check Slack then get rolling if there's enough interest.</p>

I'm starting to feel like WebPPL is the language that we ought to teach probability with.</p>
<p>While it's not a game, I find myself tweaking models just to see how it changes the generated charts. A WebPPL workflow is describing a probabilistic model (like "I deal five cards and have two pair") and returning values of interest (like "whether the next deal has three-of-a-kind"), which the system infers the likelihood of, and then presents using what it thinks are the best charts to suit the data. Its output is always a chart. Showering myself in random samples is more visceral, but seeing these plots was a rung on the ladder of abstraction that wasn't available to me before because the algebra made it so inaccessible.</p>
<p>I've started to use WebPPL to interrogate my own cognition. The other day I asked whether my idea of "healthy" is just a function of how many calories is in a serving of food. I asked by comparing that to a model that just picked randomly‚Äîturns out my theory was wrong, because the random model matched my tiny dataset better. Took me a couple of minutes. I don't even know how I would have posed that question before!</p>
<p>I want to start using it in my art. Like, it's easy to explore the parameters of an L-system by changing the parameters, but I could work backwards by drawing an example of what I want, and getting a probability  ~<em><em>distribution</em></em>~  of parameters that could have generated it. It's a type of machine learning that feels far more human-scale, and more interesting than throwing gradient descent at classification and regression tasks.</p>
<p>The physicality of generative modeling, and of the related inference algorithms, are  ~<em><em>begging</em></em>~  to be embedding in a Hest-like interface!</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope to be back with more later, hopefully in <strong>#devlog-together</strong>. :)</p>

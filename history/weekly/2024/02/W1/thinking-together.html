I've checked out GT more deeply ... because I'm looking for an extensible editor.</p>
<p>While GT is / can be an extensible editor, I was overwhelmed by it's complexity (does many other things) and by Pharo, a language in which you can extend it.</p>
<p>The question is, if you know some other alternatives.</p>
<p>My problem is that I want to write using the scientific method, which is a strict, tree like workflow, where you start with an observation (root) and do things like questions, hypothesis, experimentation, etc (nested nodes)</p>
<p>And I need an editor which I can extend with this workflow. Once extended, the editor would help/enforce me following the workflow.</p>
<p>I was thinking to write one for myself, but if by chance, it is already written, I would like to be a good / happy user üôÇ</p>

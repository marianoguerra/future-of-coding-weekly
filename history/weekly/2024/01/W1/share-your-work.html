<p>I was a little confused by the mentions of ‚Äúarchitect, engineering manager, project manager, VP of , C*‚Äù. I relate to the frustration of feeling alien in a code base built with theories that I don‚Äôt yet understand or simply disagree with, but I‚Äôve never felt like I was put there by a project manager or CEO. Did I have the wrong idea of what you meant when you described an alien world, or do I not understand the relevant pressures that people in non-engineering roles apply to software?</p>

<p>I could have even put "senior engineer, staff engineer, principle engineer" on that list so I don't think of it as non-engineering roles, but roles with more power than you.</p>
<p>I definitely think you are right that it is an alien world. But I think the world can be made alien even in greenfield development by the pressures those with power impose on you.</p>
<p>I can think of many examples in my career personally, but I admit it might not be the experience of everyone. For example, I worked on the reporting system for a small ad-tech company. The setup was a mess and no customers liked it. We had  big plans that would have made it actually useful for our customers. Everyone time we presented them to the ceo, he told us as long as the customers wanted it, we could do it. But then when the roadmap was made, he replaced everything we wrote with his own plan.</p>
<p>Working on those features was depressing.</p>

<p>I would argue that including more people is exactly what is needed. The problem is that the management intelligenceia often believes that since they have an MBA they can manage anything and they don't need to include the perspective of programmers or other technical people.</p>
<p>I have literally heard people say that technical issues should not be considered when making business decisions because the business should drive the technology and the technology should not drive the business. The result is invariably disastrous for both the technology and the business.</p>

<p>I've got so many thoughts on this that I'm afraid by me saying so much it will sound like a long winded no, so let me just start by saying yes, a diverse group should be involved in this 100% agreed.</p>
<p>First, I definitely agree the framing doesn't talk about this. This post was very much written at a time a frustration and is a personal post for me.</p>
<p>As for can folk build a theory together, I think this is an important question, but much easier said than done. In theory, this is what "cross functional" teams are supposed to do. by having qa, accessibility, legal, dev, product, etc involved it is supposed that we are now gaining the theories all these groups have into some mega theory. I don't think it is that easy.</p>
<p>The key reason is that theories aren't articulable. They are know how's. Your knowledge of accessibility isn't something can simply be written down in a brief before the project. Certainly you can make recommendations and try to provide guidelines, but I'm sure much would be left out. If you are not directly involved in building the artifact, your know-how will be left out.</p>
<blockquote><p>Are the programming-intelligentsia the only ones allowed to contribute to a theory?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I definitely hope not! But I think we have to accept that there is a real bottleneck here. One that can't be easily worked around. The programmers will build the system, and along with that will implicitly instill their own values into the system. Their understanding of the world will infect the system.</p>
<p>So, how can we fix this? Sadly it does involve changing those programmers. Part of this is of course by exposing programmers to those with other desires, perspectives, needs. (This is why I'm not a fan of "product", they filter everything a programmer sees). But I don't think process and requirements are the ultimate fix. We need the people building the system to internalize  more. To for example, include in their world the importance of accessibility. We need to raise their consciousness.</p>
<blockquote><p>Could theory building be made more intentional and expansive, like an actual step in the process of building software, and in this way include more voices?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I sadly don't think a step in the process is enough. I think we have to inculcate the habits of taking others perspectives, of reaching out to folk who may be impacted by these decisions, of pausing and researching before making decisions, of taking a broader perspective. Should programmers be the only one to contribute to the theory? Of course not! But since at the end of the day they build the system, if we don't fix who they are, their habits of thought, their process of theory formation, we will always end up with these bad results.</p>
<p>Finally, as for a shared theory, this is something I think is quite difficult and want to explore at some point on the podcast. Theories are know-hows, so wouldn't a shared theory simply be the collective know-how of a group? I don't think that's the case. But, I do think you can create the circumstances where this can be true. There's talk in HCI of "Distributed Cognition". Need to spend the time to find the right paper for it. But basic idea is that some groups can form distributed cognition where the know-how is spread out. Pilot, co-pilot, and the planes instrumentation are one classic example. But I don't think it applies to just any arbitrary set of people.</p>

<p>I wonder if this bit points back to the future of coding, and the role tools play in helping to reveal, craft, and make ‚Äúreal‚Äù theories?</p>
<p>Especially the last bit,</p>
<blockquote><p>Their understanding of the world will infect the system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What if a tool could be inoculated with different understandings of the world; Marshal McLuhan style, the medium is the message, wherein the tool could be configured with parameters that help guid theory making?</p>
<blockquote><p>But I don‚Äôt think process and requirements are the ultimate fix. We need the people building the system to internalize more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>HUGE agree here ‚Äî one of the major differences in the space where I‚Äôm at now versus other places I‚Äôve worked in the past is that teams often include, or are sometimes almost all made up of  <em>researchers</em>  ‚Äî sometimes with diverse backgrounds of previous experience. The skillset and insights these folks are able to synthesize is wild and often times remarkable.</p>
<blockquote><p>Should programmers be the only one to contribute to the theory? Of course not! But sense at the end of the day they build the system, if we don‚Äôt fix who they are, their habits of thought, their process of theory formation, we will always end up with these bad results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I read this (and agree) that this is because the the programmers often have the responsibility of making the theory ‚Äúmanifest.‚Äù</p>
<p>The shared theory thing is defo my personal point-of-interest with the whole future of coding thing. I don‚Äôt have much cogent to say about it, but am starting to think that a big bit of tension (especially when looking to Naur) is, perhaps, the specificity of a  <em>theory</em>  ‚Äî like ‚Äúreal‚Äù theories are diffuse and a bit more ephemeral than the word‚Äôs more general usage lets on.</p>

Some candidate answers (warning, not very uplifting):</p>
<ul><li>Life in small groups is better than life in large ones precisely because of impositions like this -- except for the fact that large groups have a way of outcompeting small ones. Feels a bit analogous to large cities conquering their smaller neighbors, though the consequences aren't quite as drastic these days as they were for say the Helots that competed with Sparta[1]. Not that larger is always better, just that sizes larger than some threshold seem correlated with success. Maybe small groups have to get lucky to attract a great programmer, but the odds favor large groups to do so. Every hire is a gamble, worst case is usually bounded, but best case you hire Jeff Dean. (I don't really believe this. Even Jeff Dean requires the right culture to become. But I worry. Is it possible I'm on the wrong side of history here? Here, I'll see and raise your melodrama.)</li><li>Similarly, perhaps it makes sense to have such rules because the time of a good architect maintaining a coherent vision is on balance more valuable than the cost to morale of most of the team. Having any theory is better than descending to cacophony. Again, I don't really think so, but I worry.</li></ul><p>The common thread between such thoughts is the observation that morale problems seldom seem to sink orgs. Is it just the "market" staying irrational longer than I can perceive but eventually returning to reality? Or does everyone else know something I don't?</p>

<p>In the spirit of clearly communicating what you're signing up for, this podcast episode is nearly three hours long, and among other things it contains a discussion of a paper by author Mary Shaw titled <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3480947">Myths &amp; Mythconceptions</a> which takes as an organizing principle a collection of myths that are widely believed by programmers, largely unacknowledged, which shape our views on the nature of programming  <em>as an activity</em>  and the needs of programmers  <em>as people</em>  and the sort of work that we do  <em>as a sort of work</em> , and where by acknowledging these myths the three of us (Mary Shaw primarily, and by extension Jimmy and I, those three people, that's it, no other people appear on this podcast) are able to more vividly grip the image of programming with our mind's eye (or <a href="https://aphantasia.com">somesuch</a>) and conceive of a different formulation for programming, and in addition to these myths this paper also incudes a number of excellent lists that I take great pleasure in reading, beyond which I should also note that the paper does a job of explaining itself and that hopefully you'll find I've done a similar job, that's the spirit, please enjoy.</p>

<p>At its heart it is a simple technique‚Äîlist some things that ought to be true and then let the computer burn cycles double-checking your work‚Äîand one that systematically saves time and catches bugs for professional programmers (or at least for those who bother to use it).</p>
<p>And fuzzing is almost an anti-formal-method: just throw lots of stuff at a program and see what breaks, practical engineering trade-offs everywhere you look. :)</p>

We need to empathize with the users, and design toward improving their subjective experience. A user told me once that my tool made him feel like he had super powers. The tool was (and remains) buggy as hell (a block-based visual DSL), but it was good enough, because that feeling motivates use. Use generates feedback, and feedback will help you find and fix incorrectness. So the software doesn't need to even be good enough right away. The process just needs to be self-sustaining and tend toward good enough. So I would argue new ways of measuring good enough may still be too correct a goal. The real thing is fuzzier. Have a user you care about. Fuzzy. Try to make them feel something good. Fuzzy. Learn with them. Fuzzy. Repeat. Correct is a myth, but do the fuzzy thing, and good enough will eventually emerge.</p>

<p>My sense is that the author is actually criticizing modern academic programming language researchers, but falsely generalizing her criticisms to all programming language researchers and implementers in all parts of history.</p>
<p>This paper seems to have been written in a world full of languages like Pascal, ML, and Haskell where all professional programmers work top down from a specification through a process of stepwise refinement as advocated by folks like Wirth and Dijkstra. </p>
<p>It seems to completely ignore the massive amounts of casual, exploratory, and bottom up program design that have been a major force within the Lisp, Logo, Smalltalk, Forth, SNOBOL, Perl, Python, Ruby, Unix, Emacs, and awk communities for decades. (And I almost certainly missed at least a few others.)</p>
<p>It also ignores older academic and industry work focused on writing programs that are easy to modify in the face of changing specifications (Parnas, SICP, Dijkstra, Brodie, etc.).</p>
<p>It also ignores the long history of Unix programmers saying "the environment IS the IDE." During the editor wars, it was common for the Emacs fans to point out that VI was very limited by comparison unless it was calling out to external programs. The VI fans would counter that calling out to external programs was the proper Unix way to do things rather than reinventing the world within your editor. Unix programmers have been hyper aware of their development and execution ecosystem, and not just their programming language, for the better part of 50 years.</p>
<p>It also ignores escape hatches within vernacular programming systems. Does someone stop being a vernacular programmer when they decide that Excel formulas are no longer enough and they need to use some VBA?</p>
<p>I think there may be some validity to this paper as a criticism of mathematical naval gazing within the ivory tower, but I'm not sure it says much about the industry as a whole or even programming language designers in general.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt think that is warranted.  She is always clear that what she describes and criticizes is  ‚Äútypical‚Äù, not ‚Äúall‚Äù.   For example: ‚ÄúTraditional general-purpose programming languages, or at any rate the ones of most interest to programming language researchers‚Ä¶‚Äú.   Next:  ‚ÄúMainstream languages are usually designed‚Ä¶‚Äú.   And so on and so forth.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should have said "most," but I think my point still holds. The most popular programming languages among programmers are not of much interest to today's academic programming language researchers, and are not particularly mathematically tractable.</p>

I was right there with him. I'm not even sure that most academic language researchers believe them. I think they might just act like they believe them because their attention is naturally drawn to things that they can write mathematical looking papers about because mathematical looking papers appear to be more "serious" research.</p>

When Go was adding generics, it went through multiple years of deliberation over clarity, usability, usefulness, and compile time. Everything was focused on the developer experience, with lots of concern given to approachability for less experienced programmers. Only once the team was reasonably happy on that front did they go find some type theorists to double-check that what they'd created wasn't going to blow up on them later. It felt (from the outside) more like a box-ticking exercise.</p>

<p>So what do you think makes  ~<em><em>programming</em></em>~  different from  ~<em><em>software engineering</em></em>~  different from  ~<em><em>computer science</em></em>~ ?</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt think these activities form a natural kind. So it doesn‚Äôt seem we are trying to get at the truth by making these divisions. Instead we are trying to rank them.

<p>I especially don‚Äôt understand the point of drawing a distinction between programming and software engineering. What do we gain by making this distinction?

If I‚Äôm drawing up plans for how I‚Äôm going to make a chair, am I really involved in an activity distinctly different from wood working?</p>
<p>By drawing these distinctions we also open the door for the division of labor to occur. This creates the awful concept of ‚Äúarchitect‚Äù. The perhaps most harmful concept we‚Äôve ever created as a profession. </p>

<p>I agree that programming vs. software engineering has an aspect of status, which I dislike as much as you do. But it also contains an aspect of size or complexity of a software project, and that makes sense.

<p>So if a single person does something does it cease to be software engineering? Is quickjs not an example of software engineering because it was all done by Fabrice and isn't maintained by a group of people?</p>
<p>By the same token, does the maintenance of a spreadsheet by a group of people with codified practices count more as software engineering than the development of quickjs because multiple people were involved?</p>
<p>I don't mean this to be pointed, I sincerely don't understand what the distinction is supposed to be. Is it about groups? Is it about rigor? Is it subject matter, difficulty?</p>
<p>I don't consider anything I've done in my career to meet the criteria you gave. I don't think any of the processes I've done are repeatable, except the act of programming itself, which are trying to make as a distinction here.</p>

<p>Yeah, I just don't buy that though. A lot of what falls under the banner of software engineering is no more complex than writing 50 lines of code to reformat blog entries. The way in which I think about doing these activities is the same. The kinds of decisions you have to make to do them is the same. I am spending hours and hours of my time right now at work resolving merge conflicts from a fork that stopped tracking upstream. It is all to support things at a massive industrial scale. But my activity is writing a little clojure script that shells out to help me manage git patches. Is this software engineering? Does it change it if the resolutions here are for a compiler?</p>

<p>‚ÄîI would very much  <em>like</em>  for it to be different. I would like it to be the case that we who want to claim the mantle of ‚Äúengineers‚Äù take responsibility for (and are held accountable for!) the work we do in a particular way. And while yes, that would then become aspirational, it would be because we are expecting more from a subset of the field of software practitioners, and thereby perhaps elevating the field as a whole a bit.</p>

<blockquote><p>computer science is not a science,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you referring to the old debate about what Herbert Simon nicely called "sciences of the artificial", which some do and others don't consider science? Or is it about CS not being serious/mature/whatever enough to be called science?</p>
<p>Personally, I am happy to include the sciences of the artificial under the "science" label, and I am happy with accepting immature fields as well, as long as they are working towards improvement of their own standards. So CS is a science for me. It's just not about computers, but that's only a problem with the English-language label.</p>
<blockquote><p> and software engineering is trying to be a science but still faking it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the old science-vs.-engineering debate, I have taken the taoist stance and declared them a yin-yang pair. Science is about learning how the world works, and engineering is about changing the world based on scientific understanding. The problem with SE is that is hasn't much of a "science" partner yet. People are too busy making software and then making it obsolete that they have no time to reflect on their practices. So yes, "faking it" is a good description.</p>

It's that vast swathes of CS academia aren't good at nailing down the context for their conclusions. They're often not reproducible, and even if you can reproduce them you can't reason about whether they apply to a slight change in context (this improves things for these benchmarks; does it help for this other benchmark?) You have to rerun the whole experiment all over again.</p>

Sounds familiar. But more an issue with 21-st century academia than with CS specifically. It's not different in other disciplines.

I had a few “aha” moments and I’m decidedly in the “hit everything with this hammer to figure out where the nails are” phase.</p>
<p>Anyway, is anybody here in a similar headspace? Or already experienced with PPLs?</p>
<p>Is anybody curious to enter this headspace with me? I reviewed the (online, free, programmable) book that brought me here: <a href="https://micro.alltom.com/2024/01/11/the-cognition-in.html">micro.alltom.com/2024/01/11/the-cognition-in.html</a></p>

<p>The “Cognition” in Probabilistic Models of Cognition :books: is the hardest part to get across when I recommend this book. Because the book isn’t “Bayes works, yawn.” It’s so much more interesting if you, like me, exist primarily in ML circles that focus on curve-fitting:
 What could be going on in our heads when we can’t tell that the two grid squares in that optical illusion are the same color?</p>

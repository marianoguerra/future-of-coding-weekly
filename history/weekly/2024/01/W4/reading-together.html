I think that at the very least it might be a nice way to take a break and think about the problem from a physicist’s perspective now and then, if this is still a problem you’re working on.</p>

In fact, it will rock forward and backward just based on random fluctuations, and you try to bias it just enough so that it runs forwards more often than backwards.</p>
<p>To do that, no part of it can ever create or destroy information. Every operation propagates the “waste” information forward so that if it rolls backward, it returns to its initial state. It’s fun. :)</p>

I'd expect the "green computing" people to explore it as well, but I haven't seen any references to it.</p>
<p>Something that ought to be obvious but is rarely said is that "never deleting data" also means "never adding data". A perfectly reversible computing system is useless for information processing. But searching for a good compromise ought to be an interesting engineering challenge.</p>

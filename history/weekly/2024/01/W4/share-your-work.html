<p>Inspired by Bret Victor's lectures and some of the cool stuff i've seen on here, I made a drum sequencer where the relative positions of nodes determines the spaces between notes in a pattern.</p>

<p>One thing I'd like is some way to click on a node and have playback restart from there. If I make a rhythm that has a really nice groove, I might be inclined to feel the "1" at a certain spot. And while it's possible to switch to feeling the "1" somewhere else, that's often tricky to do. Being able to click nodes (or something) would help me reset my internal sense of the rhythm and feel it different ways.</p>
<p>I could also make an argument for adding silent nodes. (If the volume had upper/lower limits instead of wrapping around, I could just make a node and turn it to 0 volume).</p>

<p>The order of nodes in the polygon changes sometimes when I'm moving a node around, some way to "freeze" a polygon might be nice.</p>
<p>Sequencing two notes together (for example a hihat and a kick at the same time) would be pretty useful.</p>

A lot of fun to explore. I didn't hit any bugs in firefox on linux. Loved how the timing feels accurate but it affords making really fluid grooves away from the grid.. But then using the circles as a guide (I found I didn't need the crosshair) I could easily make a solid 4/4 beat, then mess it up pleasingly by moving one of the beats in/out. The accurate timing meant I could put a few sounds really close together in the middle and go in and out of the sound domain by moving them in and out, making some really nice textures.</p>

<p>wondering if encoding the setup in the URL would help share sequences, which then would also enable loading pre-existing examples so we can get a good idea of what a nice sequence setup looks like (to help get started the first time)</p>

<ul><li>It's exciting that this shows you doing a lot of stuff that would normally require different apps all happening in the same place.</li><li>But if you squint a bit, it's like gloodata : plugins :: OS : apps. What's the big deal?</li><li>Well, the big deal would be if the stuff you were doing jumped across the boundaries of plugins in ways that you can't jump across the boundaries between apps. That's totally possible already in Gloodata (I've seen you do it in the past), it's just not so clear to see from a video like this.</li><li>I wonder what sort of plugins could exist that would be  <em>impossible</em>  in the traditional app world.</li><li>The video shows you working quickly, to demonstrate a lot of capability in a short time. But that, for some reason (perhaps amplified by the chat / log-like interface) makes me feel like the work happening in Gloodata is ephemeral / temporary / throwaway, like a napkin sketch. This makes me feel like it's not for doing  <em>important</em>  work. That makes me feel less inclined to check it out.</li><li>Taking both the above together, it feels like there's a 4-quadrant grid where "commonplace &lt;-&gt; impossible in apps" is on one axis, and "menial &lt;-&gt; masterpiece" is on the other axis. I'm very interested in stuff that would go in the opposite corner from where Gloodata currently resides (judging purely from the video).</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2024-01-17T19:38:57.522Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Mariano Guerra</span> <a href="./?fromDate=2024-01-14&amp;toDate=2024-01-20&amp;channel=share-your-work&amp;filter=#2024-01-17T19:38:57.522Z" class="date">2024-01-17 19:38:57</a> <div class="message"><p>there are some "economies of scale" that happen when all the plugins are under the same thing, for example the timezone plugin uses google map's geocoding to find the timezone of the place description, the weather plugin does the same, any plugin can get content extraction and summary for free, also geolocation and geocoding</p>

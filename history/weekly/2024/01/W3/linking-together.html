<p>Title: What Can Software Learn From Hypermedia?</p>
<p>I really like the premise of this paper and the first few sections of this paper, framing hypermedia as an underlying medium in software.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hypermedia was introduced not as a subgenre of software, but as a different conceptualization of what software is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not too excited by their implemented solution though (Webstrates). Still, the premise can be taken in many other directions I imagine.</p>

The discussion of limitations is excellent. I say I'm not too excited because I feel building this on top of the current web model makes it very hard to solve these key issues, which need newer fundamental abstractions. Once we're trying to make things more granular and secure at a less chunky level, we'll have to forego the web url and use some other identifier scheme for each of these hypermedia objects.</p>
<p>One aspect that I think hypermedia in general does not explore well but is touched on by this paper is representation of dynamic computation within the same medium. Specifically, since dynamic objects evolve locally with user interaction, can the evolved versions of these objects, and the intermediate execution traces, also be represented and shared in the same medium? This seems critical in a system where hypermedia is the underlying medium for software.  Handling this needs a lot of design work around what the fundamental abstractions of this medium should be. For instance, determining what kinds of links may exist between hypermedia objects, how composition of objects works (is transclusion enough?), what's the relation between the dynamically produced and static objects, and so on. I hope this paper inspires more work at the design level.</p>

Will take me some time to go through them. I feel originally hypermedia has mostly been about sharing immutable content. I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about hypermedia as the underlying medium for software and find it very compelling. Mainly I‚Äôm thinking about how to represent the dynamic aspects of computing and programming itself via hypermedia:  <em>active</em>  hypermedia. The idea would be to represent program source, derived structures, executions as well as the output in the same interlinked hypermedium. I don‚Äôt have a lot worked out but partial transclusion isn‚Äôt that useful in this context. Most references, transclused or not, are to objects with predetermined levels of granularity.</p>

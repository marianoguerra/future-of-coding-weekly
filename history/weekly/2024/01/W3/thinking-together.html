<p>To your questions, I‚Äôd love your insights from thinking in the space. </p>
<p>My take is that it‚Äôll never be either one or the other, but probably a big mix of both ‚Äî as is I and I‚Äôd wager many folks talk a lot at work, just not to computers. It is during conversations with other people. Generally, that talking leads to mouse and keyboard stuff.</p>
<p>To me, conversational interfaces are less about a novel input method and more about shifting a mode of collaboration ‚Äî when you can talk with a computer it becomes less of a tool to use to complete some work, and more of a collaborator in that task. </p>

<p>Additionally, when done via voice/response, it's inherently public, which is usually a detriment rather than a feature.</p>
<p>Lastly, people generally expect a conversational reply in a shorter time than other UI feedback, so it feels slower even if it isn't.</p>

For other systems, I suspect event-driven architectures may become more popular: they may allow for building that context on-the-fly to provide to the AI.</p>

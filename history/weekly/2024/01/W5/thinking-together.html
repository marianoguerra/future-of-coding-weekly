I’m thinking also of Fortran vs Lisp (or perhaps Forth). When is it  <em>not</em>  worth it to meet people where they are?</p>

The more ahead of your time you are, the more necessary it is to meet people where they are. Something that is very different is not therefore necessarily alienating, or difficult. It can be different precisely because of how much easier it is. But if something very different is also very difficult, it will have far less influence than it might have otherwise. Always meet your users where they are, whether you want to make evolutionary or revolutionary change. And if you can't, get different users, or make different changes.</p>

<p>I dig visual programming, but think the term is like a little bit of a brain poison because it isn't really descriptive of the goals, and, like, almost all textual programming is inherently visual, too...just...in the way text is.</p>
<p>I think <a href="http://ivanish.ca/">Ivan Reese</a> was the person I first heard float the term "spatial programming," which I dig, but at least for me, it also misses the real value add of what I'm looking for in a "visual" system.</p>
<p>So, the two terms I've been kicking around:</p>
<ul><li>relational programming</li><li>cartographic programming</li></ul><p>Neither are perfect, and both feel exhaustingly pretentious (a good thing, may haps?) but my intention with both terms is to highlight that these sorts of systems, unlike text-based programming, help make the relationships between different elements (classes, data flow, inheritance, etc.) meaningful using information other than similar names.</p>
<p>Useful? Stupid? Prior art?</p>

<p>but i misused it - I took the wrong part. the thing that makes it "non-sentential" is the ASCII TEXT, not the SPATIAL PROGRAMMING. it compiles to Ulam, which also works with spatial data, but using a sentential syntax. </p>

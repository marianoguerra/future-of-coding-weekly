The goal of ASL is to develop the technology necessary to construct commercial applications by assembling generic algorithms through declarative descriptions.</p>
<p>The first two significant libraries in ASL are known as the property model library (Adam) and layout library (Eve). They are components for modeling the human interface appearance and behavior in a software application. The property model library and layout library are described along with related libraries.</p>

<p>This is a psychology paper, so perhaps not what you usually consume, but I want to encourage you to give this a go. I think it‚Äôs super useful to leave our bubble from time to time and learn about what other disciplines‚Äô perspectives on computation are. I‚Äôll quote the summary at the end, but there is so much more building up to that that you don‚Äôt want to miss, certainly not before commenting on it. :)</p>
<blockquote><p>The view that intelligence equals some kind of computational optimization is no longer tenable. It does not help us make sense of a large world. Therefore, claims that the study of intelligence is converging onto computational rationality as its ultimate foundation are not only premature, but outright misguided. Quite the opposite: we have shown here that the basic foundation of natural agency and cognition, and therefore of anything we could reasonably call ‚Äúintelligence,‚Äù cannot be computational at all because it cannot be completely formalized. The dream of generating purely algorithmic systems able to think and act like human beings is and remains a pipe dream, because purely symbolic machines exist in small worlds, in which there is no problem of relevance to be solved.</p>

<p>One the other side, ‚Äúcomputational‚Äù does not mean deterministic/formalizable ‚Äî i.e. the fact that something is stochastic or heuristic doesn‚Äôt prevent it from being modeled via computation. Church/Kleene/Turing stands, though it‚Äôs clear that working strictly from a function call perspective is not always the right practical approach (which <a href="https://guitarvydas.github.io/2021/09/23/Manifesto.html">Paul Tarvydas</a> has recently been trying to demonstrate).</p>

<p>This paper (which I read a while ago, so I don't remember the details) uses "computation" in the Church-Turing sense, and under that interpretation I agree with the authors. And there are indeed people who make weird claims about life being "just computation" based on the same interpretation, so the criticism is somewhat justified. But then, there are also people with a wider view of computation. I used to be one of them, but I have moved to using less loaded terms (e.g. "information processing") just in order to avoid misunderstandings.</p>

Brains do information processing, but it's neither fully symbolic, nor fully deterministic, and in particular not decoupled from an organism's agency which is related to it pursuing goals shaped by evolution. Can you still call that "computation"? Some people say yes, others say no. And then there are those, against which the authors argue, who deny there's a difference.</p>

It is, in my opinion, a load of wooly metaphysics that doesn‚Äôt advance anyone‚Äôs understanding of anything. I put it in the same drawer as Wolfram‚Äôs philosophical stuff. Unfortunately, doing a proper job of explaining the ways in which it is  <em>not even wrong</em>  is a non-trivial undertaking (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandolini%27s_law">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandolini%27s_law</a>). My best attempt at  <em>extremely</em>  lossy compression:</p>
<p>I am sympathetic to ‚Äî and frequently make ‚Äî related arguments with regards to ‚ÄúAI‚Äù claims for the current generation of machine learning systems. They are not agents, and non-agentic things are not intelligent in anything like the definition we use for biological entities. Any attempt to make something actually intelligent would start from  <em>drives</em>  (something more like what we call  <em>emotions</em> ) than from simulating what many regard as intelligent activity (‚Äúwrite an essay based on a prompt‚Äù, &amp;c). Failure to understand this is part of a long running tendency of clever humans who have been rewarded for ‚Äúbeing smart‚Äù to over index on tasks for which they were rewarded rather than tasks that allowed 4 billion years of their ancestors to survive. On this general point I think I am in complete agreement with the authors.</p>
<p>But this doesn‚Äôt actually argue against the idea that biological entities are made of networks of parts undergoing processes, and that the behaviors of those parts (the nature of those processes) could be encoded in a different chemical substrate. Nor does it suggest that a mechanism that can model arbitrary processes (e.g. Turing machine) cannot model the specific processes going on inside the parts within those networks. The arguments they make against Deutsch-style pancomputationalism hinge on things like determinism/syntactic formal systems that feel completely irrelevant in this context (Turing machines can model stochastic processes, and they are ‚Äúsymbolic‚Äù only in the sense that we use symbols to understand/encode them).</p>

I appreciate you taking the time to write this. I am very interested in positions against what they argue to make up my mind of how profound their ideas really are, and being left to my own (and at this point fairly biased) interpretations probably means I‚Äôm at risk to overlook something.</p>
<p>So far, however, I only hear criticisms that seem to be rooted in the fear that the authors take some possibility away. I tend to see their attempt in differentiating algorithmic (both symbolic and stochastic) models from a totally different constraint-based dynamical systems approach that provides characteristics that the computational approach can‚Äôt as a revelatory insight that, while perhaps putting algorithmic approaches in their slightly more restricted place, doesn‚Äôt at all prevent those approaches from continuing to improve their approximations of reality. Which maps nicely to what‚Äôs happening in AI, mostly by increasing complexity in the form of increasing both data and compute. That probably also explains why I find their point about computation rather minor, <a href="https://khinsen.net/">Konrad Hinsen</a>.</p>
<p>At the same time it paves the way for a new and different path of exploration that tries to integrate human cognition, which I personally find much more refreshing than the ‚ÄúIf we just throw enough data and compute at it‚Äù approaches that are so en vogue in AI currently. There‚Äôs lots of space (and tons more resources, apparently) to build more and better models the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù way. I don‚Äôt think anyone is trying to take that away. However, there is also a refined understanding of an alternative path emerging, that seems (to me at least) to be based in good science.</p>
<p>Of course, I am an enthusiastic amateur at best, and my judgement of how good the science is means nothing to anybody else. But having spent a lot of time with some of the adjacent research, mainly relevance realization (Vervaeke) and constraint-based meta-stability in complex dynamical systems (Juarrero), there is something here that endlessly fascinates me. And it is so sad that it is so difficult to share that fascination and excitement with others.</p>

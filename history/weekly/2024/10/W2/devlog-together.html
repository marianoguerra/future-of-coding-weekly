<p>Some previous ways to have text coexist with a canvas:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://smallandnearlysilent.com/inknswitch/">A fixed background that is disconnected from text.</a></li><li><a href="https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/112536829727198624">Fixed page boundaries.</a></li></ul><p>Here I'm instead attaching doodles to a  <em>pivot</em>  character that they move with in the presence of edits. When you start drawing you're presented with a set of pivot options, one grey square per character on screen. After you pick one, it turns pink and the other options disappear. Now you can start drawing.</p>
<p>Displacements to the pivot are preserved in font-derived units, so it looks "reasonable" as you resize the font.</p>
<p>Deleting a character deletes all drawings pivoted on it. (But there's undo.)</p>
<p>This took 200 lines, so not too much though it was more than I'd initially expected.</p>

Less radically, have you considered sketches in the margins, linked to characters? Or sketches that appear in boxes, with text wrapping around them? I ask cuz ‚Äúsketch directly on top of text‚Äù doesn‚Äôt seem as useful as those. Aside from, say, editing marks. Maybe increasing line spacing would make sketches literally anchored to characters more useful?</p>

<p>I hadn't tried this until today, but it turns out to work: I can create equations forwards and back, and trigger either selectively based on what blanks I fill in.</p>
<p>The fine print: to switch directions I have to fill in the right blank, clear the old blank, and then type in something outside the old blank (to indicate I'm not going to type further into the old blank).</p>
<p>Works better if I clear the old query first, but who can remember that?</p>
<p>Perhaps I should just recompute on every mouse click. Then the third step could be clicking outside any blanks. More wasteful, because most of the time a mouse click won't require recomputation. It's Tadi, but is it permacomputing? ü¶ã</p>

The drawback there is that you might change a complex sheet in unanticipated ways because you forgot about the presence of some formulas. Things change outside your field of view. Right now that only happens for fields you've not typed anything into. So no data loss. I tend to prefer UIs with a sense of stability that aren't constantly moving what I put into them..</p>

<p>I've been experimenting with using generative AI inside Github Actions lately and have been really intrigued by this async/event driven interaction model with code generation.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/sublayerapp/sublayer_actions">this repo</a> we have a Github Action that runs every morning and has Gemini, Claude, and GPT-4 generate a PR adding additional functionality. Then on PR merge a release message is sent to our discord with example use cases and each of them riff on what was merged and try to come up with additional related functionality.</p>
<p>I've already merged a few PRs and some of the ideas they've come up with are pretty interesting, especially the riffs - I merged a PR about querying a notion database, and Gemini came up with taking a row in a Notion database and creating an Asana task.</p>
<p>Some of the things they've come up with so far:</p>

So the act of humans merging something is guiding the computer to push more in that direction?</p>
<p>This is cool. It reminds me of Doug Lenat's "Automated Mathematician" which would go off and search for interesting relationships between numbers and try to generalize from them. Once it defined some predicate or function over numbers, a human could go in and rename it (say if it was a well-known concept, like 'odd'). One of the heuristics it used was to pay more attention to definitions if a human went in and renamed them.</p>

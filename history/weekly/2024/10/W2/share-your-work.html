Most academics nowadays see their peers mainly as competitors. Which has lots of reasons, ranging from human nature via selection bias to explicit incentives defined by their sponsors. If you see yourself as a member of a huge open collaboration, you aim for your work being useful to that collaborative project. But with that attitude, it's difficult to get into an academic career that actually pays the bills. I am fortunate enough to have gotten to that point, but I see lots of people drop out rather early.</p>

I enjoy the sharing process and demoing work in progress - it even feels healthy to include, as part of the creative process as a whole...but I can't help but feel when I'm spending time on a talk, sharing on socials etc., I'm not spending time honing my craft or figuring out what it is I'm making. Sure, feedback is great to incorporate, but does it sometimes feel like noise? Esp when social media, by design, wants you to be on it and not escape to do something else üò¨</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Not sure we'd be better off. Academia promotes harmful competition because it's embedded into capitalism. Getting rid of academia while keeping capitalism is not going to help much. The void left by academia would be filled by some other capitalism-inspired institution.</p>
<p>Note: My use of "capitalism" is a caricature, but I don't have a better word for now.</p>

<p>Though I think a better image is addiction. We (collectively, as a society) are addicted to growth, i.e. ever increasing material wealth and ever increasing human populations. Capitalism (in the strict sense of the term) is merely the best technique we have found so far to ensure a steady supply of that drug. Soviet-style communism did exactly the same, but less efficiently, which is why capitalim "won". How to get rid of an addiction? I suspect it requires help from outside. Outside being marginal communities practicing different values. In the worst case, they can "take over" when capitalism crashes, which is inevitable in a finite world. Ideally, they will take over before.</p>
<p>Open sharing of non-material wealth is an important aspect of doing better than capitalism, so this is actually related to the topic of this thread.</p>

<p>I did the research (Here is the link: <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVN1CP7ck=/?share_link_id=508424426161">miro.com/app/board/uXjVN1CP7ck=/?share_link_id=508424426161</a>) and I am quite excited to meet some of the folks that I encountered there.

<ul><li>The miro is lots of fun. The information density (very sparse) makes it a bit hard to approach, but once I felt my way through the rough shape it became more comprehensible. Surely, this must be very helpful as a research aid for you. I'd love to see this info put together into a more sharable form. (Note to self: the visual programming codex sucks and needs an overhaul!)</li><li>The white paper is long enough that I haven't yet taken the time to read it in depth, just gave it a quick skim, so apologies if any of my feedback is inappropriate or unhelpful. You've put a lot of work into this and deserve a deeper read/reflection from someone, but I won't be able to be that person, at least not right now. With that being said, here's some quick / superficial feedback, in case it helps.</li><li>This project seems  <em>very</em>  broad. I describe these sorts of projects as "burn it all down and start over" or "reinvent the universe". Like, I repeatedly had to ask myself "wait, doesn't 'the web' already do this?" It's unclear to me whether you feel there's a targeted, specific problem at the root of it all, one that could be addressed with a surgical fix to our technology, and are incrementally feeling your way toward a better understanding of that problem ‚Äî if so, great, keep going. Or, instead, if you started from a place of "computers could be better" broadly and accumulated a whole laundry list of things that could be done differently and tried to pull them together ‚Äî if so, you're signing up for a much harder challenge, one that will require the involvement of many people, and thus you'll need to work very hard on communicating the problem and convincing people to help. So note the difference: one of these is a problem you can solve with design and invention, the other is a problem you'll need to solve with communication and community. It might be worth thinking about what sort of work you enjoy doing, and what sort of feedback / criticism you're interested in receiving, and whether that's the sort of work/reflection that you'll need to do to see this project through to completion.</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2024-10-13T17:10:37.343Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Ivan Reese</span> <a href="https://history.futureofcoding.org/?fromDate=2024-10-10&amp;toDate=2024-10-16&amp;channel=share-your-work&amp;filter=#2024-10-13T17:10:37.343Z" class="date">2024-10-13 17:10:37</a> <div class="message"><p>Small things:</p>
<ul><li>Steve  <em>Krouse</em> is spelled incorrectly in a few places. Also, while he started the FoC community, he hasn't been active here since 2020.</li><li>The "SomethingNew" community doesn't actually maintain that spreadsheet you linked in footnote 28. That spreadsheet is by <a href="https://twitter.com/Duncan__Cragg">Duncan Cragg</a>, for this community. (And I think <strong>@Dan Cook</strong> has withdrawn from being active in the broader SomethingNew / FoC / etc sphere of communities, and thus SomethingNew has fallen dormant.)</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2024-10-13T17:59:13.207Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Kartik Agaram</span> <a href="https://history.futureofcoding.org/?fromDate=2024-10-10&amp;toDate=2024-10-16&amp;channel=share-your-work&amp;filter=#2024-10-13T17:59:13.207Z" class="date">2024-10-13 17:59:13</a> <div class="message"><p>I miss Dan Cook.

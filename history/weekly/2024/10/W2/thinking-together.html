<blockquote><p>Despite the variety of creative approaches practiced by different scientists, one tried-and-true though often overlooked ‚Äî trick for generating new ideas stands out. It may sound trivial, yet it is as reliable as it is simple: talk to someone. By talking with other people, we not only pool the information or ideas that each of us individually lacks, but we are also able to improvise new thoughts that are not accessible to us alone. In this episode, Itai Yanai and Martin Lercher talk through the ideas in two of their editorials (available at 
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-02074-2">nature.com/articles/s41587-023-02074-2</a>

If you‚Äôre confused about the planets, so am I; I think that was part of a joke because everyone was waiting for me to declare which programming language goes where, but that would‚Äôve obviously derailed the conversation and my point was that in the grand scheme of things their differences are just a small part of the whole design space.

As I envision it, cells are described using text, where each cell represents a different application component, including data, GUI widgets, and even code. Groups of cells may be arranged hierarchically, such as a window-type parent cell and its child GUI widget cells. Different cell types have different attributes. Date-type cells have a value attribute that represents the date, a date format attribute, etc. GUI widget-type cells have display-type attributes. Code-type cells have code-triggering attributes (e.g., time-based, cell attribute value-based, etc.) As in a spreadsheet, cell attribute values are defined using literals or reactive formulas that may depend on other cell attribute values. As in a spreadsheet, the application ‚Äúruns‚Äù when cell attribute values change and other cell attribute values are recalculated.

The code in the cells usually calls library functions that are almost black-box code (even itf its Open Source, few notebook users can figure out how to see it), which is why you get only coarse-grained explanations.</p>
<p>Maybe more importantly, notebooks emphasize code whereas spreadsheets emphasize the input data. It would nice to be able to mix both, at the discretion of the user.</p>

Makes me question whether end user programmable is that much of a useful direction overall. Sometimes I think its a UX thing, but actually I just think cognitive overhead of orientating yourself in a foreign codebase, or just not being able to read code (non-pgorammer or unfamiliar language). However, the 1% of people who do read code find it very useful. I actually think code reuse through linked notebooks is also only useful for the individual, but copy and pasting working code across notebooks between teams is more prevalent, because new contexts for code have slightly different requirements and emphasis, so its basically its better to copy and paste code and trim to the situational need than to try to build (bloated) reusable libraries.</p>
<p>I don't think notebooks are code-first though, they are sparse-complex values-first (list of objects/markdown), whereas spreadsheets are dense-simple values-first (matrix of scalars). You said yourself people don't read the code in notebooks.</p>

I see them advertised for two very different roles, which however have conflicting requirements:</p>
<ul><li>An interactive tool for explorative programming.</li><li>A computational document for publication.</li></ul><p>They do a better job at 1 than at 2, largely because prominently displayed code matters for 1, whereas the reader of a computational document would prefer to understand the data-based narrative first and only then (or maybe never) look at the code for a deeper understanding.</p>

I just made <a href="https://history.futureofcoding.org/?fromDate=2024-09-27&amp;toDate=2024-10-03&amp;channel=introduce-yourself&amp;filter=#2024-09-30T12:53:21.324Z">ðŸ’¬ #introduce-yourself@2024-09-30</a> and promised a glimpse of our work. We (the <a href="https://www.kendra.io">Kendraio</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kendraio_kendraio-kendraioapp-interoperability-activity-7199366975783858177-3vKL">team</a>) are currently experimenting with no-code, local-first and malleable-software isms.</p>
<p>We want to create a local environment where it is really easy for end-users and non-developers to build workflows and manage their own data, whilst also being able to plug into the services (apps and websites) that they currently use and build their own user-interfaces for those services. It's a big dream and we've started small.</p>
<p>A few years ago during the pandemic we built a <a href="https://app.kendra.io/kendraio/coronavirus">dashboard for COVID-19 data</a>. Our Flow plugged into various APIs and then visualised the received data on one page â€“ so a good demonstration of one aspect of our dream. The dashboard still exists but shows historical data. We wrote an <a href="https://medium.com/kendraio/covid-19-kendraio-creates-coronavirus-dashboard-within-kendraio-app-a0185e526b25">article</a> about the dashboard which also has an accompanying <a href="https://youtu.be/OD_SN99Sy8Q">video</a> explaining how it works and how you can edit the Flow while it's running.</p>
<p>Enjoy! Look forward to any comments or questions. Cheers!</p>

<ul><li>Christopher Esterhuyse -- <a href="https://ltvanbinsbergen.nl/files/papers/sle2024.pdf">Cooperative Specification via Composition Control </a>(SLE2024)</li></ul><ul><li>This paper investigates control mechanisms in declarative languages that can be used by a programmer to have guarantees about the written program even when it is extended by other programmers. The work is motivated by distributed systems governed by policies in which the actors that provide the policies may have been competing interests. Concretely, think about (data sharing) contracts that are embedded in a federated cloud infrastructure.</li></ul><ul><li>Damian FrÃ¶lich -- <a href="https://ltvanbinsbergen.nl/files/papers/gpce2024.pdf">On the Soundness of Auto-completion Services for Dynamically Typed Languages </a>(GPCE2024)</li></ul><ul><li>This paper investigates the use of "abstract interpretation" to give sound auto-complete suggestions for dynamic languages and demonstrates the technique on a subset of Python. Here "sound" means: if you select a given candidate, the inserted code will not contain variables that turns out to be undefined when the code runs.</li></ul><ul><li>Max Boksem -- <a href="https://ltvanbinsbergen.nl/files/papers/paint2024.pdf">Bridging Incremental Programming and Complex Software Development Environments </a>(PAINT2024)</li></ul><ul><li>This paper demos a prototype that we built to investigate a modular graph structure for representing and running source code. The tool allows you to create different projections out of the code such as code structure, documentation view, and execution history. The tool supports incremental and exploratory programming and "nested graphs" (importing a graph as a node) for hierarchical views, although this is a more recent add-on.</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div> <div class="replies"><div id="2024-10-06T08:32:26.544Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Konrad Hinsen</span> <a href="https://history.futureofcoding.org/?fromDate=2024-10-03&amp;toDate=2024-10-09&amp;channel=share-your-work&amp;filter=#2024-10-06T08:32:26.544Z" class="date">2024-10-06 08:32:26</a> <div class="message"><p>I am looking forward to the last one in particular.

Instead, the audience will discuss the work and will give an opportunity to the authors to ask questions. This should result in great feedback for us, and generally good discussion, but may not be the most informative about the work itself. I will ask Max to record a video demo and share it here once I have it.</p>

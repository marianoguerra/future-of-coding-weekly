<p>I'm thinking about writing something, but it seems like a typechecker like tsc would have a lot of related logic, and if I can I'll experiment using some other friendly tool first. Any tips/references please shout, thanks!</p>

I wrote it down in a blog post here: <a href="https://blog.waleson.com/2024/09/the-future-of-programming-systems-four.html">blog.waleson.com/2024/09/the-future-of-programming-systems-four.html</a></p>
<p>There are four thoughts that I think will shape the future:</p>
<ul><li>Software development systems have a lot of vestigial parts (left-overs from the way it evolved)</li><li>Understanding is crucial to development, and with the right mediums we can understand the subject much faster</li><li>Most software platforms developed bottom-up, from the silicon, instead of focusing on the needs of the people</li><li>Software is truly different from other technologies in the freedom it gives us, so we can and should invent new abstractions that make things simpler than they are now</li></ul><p>This isn't in the post, but I think that in the future we'll see:</p>
<ul><li>Great integration between design tools, version control, IDEs, databases, monitoring &amp; logging systems.</li><li>High-level concepts as first class systems in the programming systems. Simple examples are an email or phone number type as a database primitive, instead of strings.</li><li>Better reasoning / business logic rules so that IDEs can give feedback on "you are not allowed to store PII in this database".</li></ul><p>This way all stakeholders can collaborate and the system can check correctness much better, and we require less discipline/in-depth knowledge from the team members.</p>
<p>I suspect most of these ideas have come by in this community already, but still curious what you think!</p>

<p>One obstacle I see is the widespread belief in "software" and "programming" as universal abstractions. Human-friendly environments will have to be domain-specific. As a researcher working on protein dynamics, I have no use for your "phone number" entity, but I have lots of others that even my colleagues in neighboring domains would have no use for.</p>
<p>Domain-specific tools would necessarily need to a fragmentation of the software professions, and I suspect that is something many people don't want to happen.</p>

<p>So the best known programming tools have universal adoption and hence offer the lowest common denominator in terms of concepts. This makes sense, the most powerful systems I've seen were indeed focused on making one kind of application.</p>

Once you have done this for ten domains, you can look for shared aspects, a common infrastructure, and other low-level stuff. I see today's main problem in that we work the other way round: we start from tech stacks and have software specialists develop apps for users who are not expected to understand or modify these appls.</p>

This is a PDF created with Apple Pages. Lately, I've been using substack for blogging, but writing in Apple Pages (before that, I was blogging on github, then Obsidian (from which I have since escaped)). I've discovered that dragging a Pages document that contains footnotes and images into substack is a very manual mega-project. Subtstack allows me to drag'n'drop PDF files directly into a post, but, readers must download the PDF to view it. Github allows me to "embed" PDFs in a frame that makes them kinda visible, whereas substack doesn't do this.

<blockquote><p>... There has to be inertia in technology if you want it to be useful. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inertia only gets you so far. I claim that it is  <em>impossible</em>  to express asynchronous concurrency using a function-based paradigm. You can chip away at trying to get there incrementally, but you reach an asymptote that you can only get closer to, but, never arrive at.</p>
<p>I claim that we're witnessing this phenomenon  <em>right now</em> .</p>
<p>The real questions are: (1) is it impossible to express asynchronous concurrency using a function-based paradigm, and, (2) is it really true that the crop of problems that we face are rife with asynchronous concurrency?</p>
<p>If (1) and (2) are true, then continuing to push on the function-based paradigm is futile and a waste of time. Take the wins from thinking that way and move on. No need to wipe out what we've already achieved. Just stop beating our heads against the wall of what cannot be achieved in the future.</p>
<p>Alpha-beta pruning. If the going gets tough, find a way to make it be less tough. If you end up in a corner, don't keep pushing deeper into the corner.</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>For stuff that lots of people depend on, you can't just pull the plug and start from scratch every couple of years.</p>
<p>Did I actually say that I recommend pulling the plug? I hope not. In fact, all of my experiments with this stuff are based on existing technologies, like Odin, Python, <a href="http://draw.io">draw.io</a>.</p>
<p>Concurrency is easy (even the asynchronous kind). 5-year olds, without PhDs, understand hard realtime and written notation for expressing hard realtime (piano lessons and music notation). If concurrency using a specific paradigm looks not-easy, that's a tell. If you need to keep inventing workarounds to keep pushing a belief system, that's a tell. If you espouse an edict that contradicts reality, that's a tell (e.g. "no mutation" violates the basic premise of CPUs bolted to RAM ; e.g. "control flow is data" is patently untrue (the data that control flow  <em>interprets</em>  is data, but the  <em>interpreter</em>  is not data (CPUs are interpreters, albeit very fast ones))). When the tells pile up, maybe it's time to reconsider whether forging ahead on only one path continues to be reasonable.</p>
<blockquote><p>For that reason, the only possibility I see for your ideas to become reality is as a 
 <em>generalization</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's something that I disagree with. The answers will not come from further  <em>generalization</em>  but from further  <em>specialization</em> . Our current software development workflows are based on the idea of  <em>generalization</em> . If you insist on incrementally developing something, how about incrementally developing a way to allow  <em>specializations</em>  to co-exist and to be composed into functioning code? (hint: I'm playing with and blogging about how to use existing languages as  <em>assemblers</em>  for new languages)</p>
<p>[I view, correctly or incorrectly, "Moldable Development" as another idea for how to insert specialization into our workflows.]</p>
<blockquote><p>Future systems must allow today's software to remain usable, </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<blockquote><p>and then open up new ways that can be explored incrementally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You, also, need to be able to tell if you're at a dead-end and when to stop wasting your time.</p>
<p>Remembering and understanding how hardware works might offer up new ways to create new things. OTOH, pure research is, indeed, worthwhile. IMO, pushing on the functional paradigm has transmogrified into pure research into only  <em>one</em>  way to use ReprEMs (reprogrammable electronic machines - formerly known as "computers"). I wish to point out that there are many other vectors for pure research into the use of ReprEMs , that remain to be low-hanging fruit and might lead to more fruitful and cost-effective approaches to using ReprEMs.</p>

I can't even drag'n'drop markdown into it. You have to use their editor, and manually enter text. Apple Pages can already export to epub and to .docx. The problem is that substack doesn't grok those formats. substack does partly grok Apple Pages format, but not footnotes and diagrams/images/screenshots (I haven't found anything yet that makes inclusion of .png / .svg easy and visible. Obsidian does, but it's paywalled, with unpleasant repercussions if you stop paying (ask me how I know üôÇ). Github is close but no cigar). Substack's appeal is its distribution and other non-technical things. If substack would allow me to pump markdown or leanpub's markua at it, I would probably be happier.

The only point we seem to disagree on is the role of inertia.</p>
<blockquote><p>Inertia only gets you so far.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The role of inertia is to keep the rate of change in society at a level that society can absorb by adapting. So yes, it's an obstacle to innovation. But if you insist in innovating faster, the society will just ignore your work. Which is what is happening to most of us here (also for other reasons of course).</p>
<p>A "dead end" for innovation may well be what non-tech people are happy with. I doubt that's the case for today's IT, but that's another story. You don't want to get stuck in a dead end when doing research, but then research is a minority activity anyway, and will always remain one. As a researcher myself, I mostly share your point of view. But I also understand the majority of non-researchers who just want to tweak mainstream stuff to get a job done.</p>
<p>My choice of "generalization" was not the best one. The idea is that your new stuff and the old stuff must live in a single technological realm in which application-oriented people can move around with ease. Your new high-concurrency computers must be usable as coprocessors for commodity machines at first.</p>

<p>1) I disagree with your disagreement. It appears that we disagree on deep-down beliefs, inertia is just a second order effect.</p>
<p>2) End-users don't care if developers use assembler or Haskell. It appears that most of my comments regard developers and practical application of programming research. Does that clarification of perspective change the thrust of this thread?</p>
<p>3) It seems to me that compute-ing is unduly influencing practical aspects of programming (while end-users just don't care).</p>

<p>What's the limiting factor? Is it, say, that you don't have a good UI to give people access to the programming model? Or do you not have a programming model that allows parameterization?</p>

I guess right now I'm missing both - I can imagine possible representation. Currently, this is a sequence of edits that do something to a document (app/whatever).</p>
<p>I think I could do what I want if I added a way to say an edit is only applicable if a certain condition holds (otherwise it should be skipped when replaying). The other thing I need is some kind of "apply these edits to all of these things". I think I can add these two things to the representation reasonably well - then the limiting factor will be a sensible UI for those. (So if there are any PbD systems that have similar concepts, I'd be curious how they handle the user-interaction...)</p>
<p>It may also be that my current thinking about the representation is wrong - and so if there are other ways of doing this, it would be interesting to know...</p>
<p>I remember seeing nice demos in Wrangler - where generalization was easy (you do things on one row, it generalizes to all other rows). But I suppose in document context, you can generalise to something like (perhaps cleverly inferred) CSS selector...</p>

<p>My thoughts on this, if it's helpful:</p>
<p>You need an affordance on your action that allows you to say "I selected  <em>this concrete stuff</em>   <em>because</em>   <em>it has these qualities</em> ". If the qualities are visible / tangible things you can see and touch (eg: "I selected this object  <em>because</em>  it is red") then that lends itself quite naturally to PbD, because you don't need much additional representation beyond what's already on the canvas. But if you want to work with qualities that  <em>aren't</em>  visible / tangible (eg: "I selected this object  <em>because</em>  it has unsaved changes"), well you have two choices: 1. find a way to make those qualities visible/tangible on the canvas, 2. find a way to expose that stuff via some UI and be okay with the fact that it's a little more abstract.</p>

On instadeq 2 I did the reverse, by default it applies to all and you have to remove the iterator to make it apply to a single item or a slice.</p>

<p>the idea of reifying/defunctionalizing path transversal and updates may be useful to you</p>

I just listened to the AgentSheets episode and wanted to share that I‚Äôm working on a PBE + block programming educational tool. It‚Äôs a work in progress but the vision is of something like ‚Äúa macro recorder for Kid Pix‚Äù that lets you switch between drawing and code editing. <a href="https://motifdesigner.netlify.app/">motifdesigner.netlify.app</a> Target audience is elementary school age kids, though it‚Äôs also meant to be fun for adults to tinker with.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm excited that there seems to be a bit more traction (or at least interest?) around PBE again. I thought it was an interesting point in the paper/episode that it hasn‚Äôt necessarily gone out of fashion because it wasn‚Äôt a good idea, but because other solutions emerged to some of the problems it was trying to solve.</p>

<p>Something that‚Äôs not clear to me from my quick look: Are the programs you make with this fully ‚Äústatic‚Äù, so far? That is, is this currently like the Illustrator history view: a reification of concrete actions which can be manipulated, but without ‚Äúcomputation‚Äù in the form of parameterization, repetition, etc? What are your plans for these?</p>
<p>Also curious how you‚Äôd relate your plans to Bret Victor‚Äôs ‚ÄúDrawing Dynamic Visualizations‚Äù (<a href="https://vimeo.com/66085662">vimeo.com/66085662</a>). It certainly seems like you‚Äôre aiming for a different audience, but I‚Äôm curious how that‚Äôs reflected in the system‚Äôs design.</p>

So it's meant to be a playful tool that celebrates the process of making. It's also bitmap-based, so it's not fully two-way the way that some of the vector-based tools like this are. Ie. you can't click on a shape on the canvas directly and move it around because that wouldn't make sense if the shape had already been sliced up with other tools. In exchange you get some fun bitmap operations, and my hunch is that you get to see something about how kids reason between the two ways of operating on their designs.</p>

For example, the ‚Äúdraw‚Äù button copies any line of code to the active brush, which means you can shift from editing parameters in the code to drawing it anew, and sometimes you might choose one mode over the other. You can also create wonky hand-drawn repeat patterns and then use them with programmed brushes. And it‚Äôs all in the context of printing and fabricating something physical (will get back to that!)</p>

Chipping away at articles regarding a bunch of experiments towards creating higher level syntax for programming languages. Thus far, I've managed to consolidate t2t (text-to-text transpilation) into a single .mjs file and to redocument it. Wrote an adjunct article about experimenting with "t2t" using a toy meta-programming language to generate code in existing languages. "T2T creates DSLs. T2T reduces the amount of work required to build a DSL. You should be able to create a new DSL in an afternoon. ..." <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/programmingsimplicity/p/experiments-with-text-to-text-transpilation?r=1egdky&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">open.substack.com/pub/programmingsimplicity/p/experiments-with-text-to-text-transpilation?r=1egdky&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web</a></p>

<p>There are 2 kinds of lines here:</p>
<ul><li>Regular lines are prose, but you can also insert named blanks into them using the syntax  <code>[value|name]</code> , which renders vertically across 2 lines. You can't nest blanks within blanks. These lines can wrap, but a single blank can't wrap across multiple lines on screen.</li><li>Indented lines (though the indentation is currently subtle) are code. They can render fractions using the syntax  <code>(a/b)</code>  as I showed before. (Not sure I'll keep this in the long term.) You can nest fractions within fractions. These lines don't support wrapping.</li></ul><p>Planned:</p>
<ul><li>synchronizing blanks with the same name</li><li>using code in indented lines to compute derived names without values inline.</li></ul><p>Inspirations:</p>

<p>It looks like I care about always making the styling very transparent, so it's possible in principle to guess what characters one needs to type to copy the look of something one sees on screen. So the style directives will never be hidden.</p>

<p>As a user, when writing a long essay, I occasionally find this behaviour disconcerting - the appearance on the screen changes so dramatically that it is disconcerting. I feel "not in control".</p>
<p>The older Obsidian editor had two modes (1) writing and (2) reading. That felt clumsy. I guess that I could enable that behaviour with some option, but, I never do.</p>
<p>Emacs md-mode shows a hint of the styling, e.g.  <code>_abc_</code>  is displayed with abc italicized but leaving the underscores visible and taking up space that doesn't appear in the final rendering in a browser.</p>
<p>Traditional WYSIWYG editors like Microsoft Word and Apple Pages make formatting characters invisible, but, show formatting details in a property box off to the side (where you're not looking) while binding formatting operations to certain keystrokes, e.g. command-I for italic.</p>
<p>PlantUML uses two side-by-side Siamese Twin windows - a writing window and a preview window. Our "Slider" app in the Handmade Jam (last year?) did that (two windows), too.</p>
<p>A freebie "user-friendly" LaTeX editor (LyX) tries to straddle both views at once - like the new Obsidian editor - but, I find myself not using it.</p>
<p>Thus far, as a user, I find all of the above choices evil. I tend to favour WYSIWYG, but, wonder if the two-window approach would be better if the tool made the windows entirely separate instead of being bolted together.</p>
<p>I find translucency intriguing (<a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1726773202938769">futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1726773202938769</a>), but haven't used a word processing editor that contains it.</p>
<p>Currently, I use the lesser of two evils. I switched from using Obsidian (out-of-human-control formatting) to using Pages (WYSIWYG with a property box at the side). My frequency of swearing hasn't decreased, but the target of swearing has moved.</p>

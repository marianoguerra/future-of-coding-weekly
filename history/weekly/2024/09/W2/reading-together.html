Going back and rewriting an aspect of a working program just to improve one property of the  <em>code</em>  rather than the behavior: eliminating all derived data structures and re-deriving everything all the time in a performant way.</p>
<p>The result is a simpler API that seems applicable to pixel-based editors that use proportional fonts. Basically the problem is: as you do line-wrapping on a screen, how do you deal with interactive operations like clicking at a pixel coordinate or pressing the down arrow (which might result in a scroll). These primitives seem to make the implementation fairly self-evident: <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~akkartik/lines2.love/tree/main/item/move.lua#L11-28">git.sr.ht/~akkartik/lines2.love/tree/main/item/move.lua#L11-28</a></p>

Here's a kinda whimsical toy where '+' flips the direction of writing from horizontal to vertical and  <em>vice versa.</em>  I only had to put this rule in in one place, and all my support for editing, moving and clicking on the screen to position the cursor continues to work.</p>
<p>(I did need to generalize a couple of things to get to this point.)</p>
<p>Can anyone think of potential uses for syntax geometry?</p>

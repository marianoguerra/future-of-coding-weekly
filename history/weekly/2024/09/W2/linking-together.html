<p>The crux of the argument seems to be that it's hard to foster literacy in dynamic media (and therefore systems thinking at population scale?) with small individual-scale screens that tend to keep people learning separately. It'll be easier to accomplish if we can learn together, experiencing computational media together in the space around us.</p>
<p>It's not the thing, it's just the thing that will get us to the thing. I sure hope we get to the thing.</p>
<hr><p>One cost of physical things: They take up space. This is something I'm acutely conscious of as I sit in my tiny home in San Francisco watching videos of huge rooms containing dozens of posters -- with no affordance for scrolling.</p>
<p>To the extent that the goal is to help cope with say climate change (I can't link to 6:10 in <a href="https://dynamicland.org/2024/Intro">dynamicland.org/2024/Intro</a>), this seems like a bet that low-density places will be more competitive in the next 100 years. Even as the habitable area on Earth shrinks.</p>
<p>To be fair, I do have tons of unused wall space high up. There's also likely lots of room for such collective spaces to interplay with more private screens.</p>
<hr><p>It's unfortunate that I can't search through almost all of the site. Again, this may be ok. Their primary goal is for the site to be physical. The web version is second class, and that's a reasonable opinionated position to take.</p>

<blockquote><p>One cost of physical things: They take up space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been thinking about this a bit today. I've seen a few people bring this up.</p>
<p>I think a lot of the way that DL currently "uses space" is an incidental complexity ‚Äî just like the cameras and projectors are an incidental complexity. It seems like they want  <em>dynamic objects,</em> not necessarily big posters and binders and tables full of stuff. Like, I think it'd be perfectly reasonable to assume they'd like you to (eg) be able to buy any old pocket notebook, and for every page in that notebook to be augmented by itself, not needing any extra hardware.</p>
<p>They talk a bit about a change that took place when they set up the bio lab ‚Äî they got a higher-res projector and upgraded their recognizers, and this let them make their tracking dots smaller, or do away with the dots entirely, so they could use new kinda of objects as  <em>dynamic objects</em> . So I think it's safe to assume that they want that trend to continue. So in the long run, there's no difference between the space you already live in, and the objects in it‚Ä¶ and the  <em>dynamic</em>  version of that space and objects.</p>

The reason for the dichotomy: it seems much easier to not make messes in digital spaces. Physical spaces will be messy, particularly collective physical spaces. Doubly particularly, collective physical spaces with kids.

<p>I dunno - my computer desktop is always a mess üòÖ Also, without intentional organising, second brains can be a mess (and often abandonded). I find the infiniteness of digital being a burden sometimes, whereas with physical things/spaces, it can be more human scale and manageable. Marie Kondo taught me that being organised is more a mindset üòõ</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This got lost in the transition from OS 9 to OS X. In the classic era, Finder would remember the window position and display settings for every folder, in particular the arrangement of icons (for whenever you switched to icon view). If you put something somewhere, that's where it'd be henceforth.</p>
<p>OS X  <em>kinda</em>  does this  <em>sometimes</em> . It's just a tendency, not a promise.</p>
<p>Never forget what they took from us!</p>

It's been mysterious to me as well. Bret Victor is often pointing at whiteboards or posterboards or now 3-ring binders that are supposedly the physical embodiment of Realtalk. But I don't get it. How much work is it to scan the code from the binders to wherever it runs on? What makes the server less of a locus of the computation than the binder?</p>
<p><a href="https://dynamicland.org/archive/2022/Realtalk_binders">dynamicland.org/archive/2022/Realtalk_binders</a> shows 3-ring binders where each icon is showing just the first few lines of code. I gather you go back to the documents tied with clips on the whiteboard for some of it. So it's clearly not all in the binder. How is it in the object?</p>
<p>One bit of good news:</p>
<blockquote><p>I hope it's building up to a point where I can interact intensely with dynamic objects in your office and vice versa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://dynamicland.org/archive/2022/Realtalk_binders">dynamicland.org/archive/2022/Realtalk_binders</a> does talk about "multiple sites", so there's some signs of this at least at the lowest levels of abstraction. Now if I could understand the flow of data/code in this project.. so far it seems like "this lives in the object" is a distracting side-debate.</p>
</div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2024-09-05T18:40:02.747Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Ivan Reese</span> <a href="https://history.futureofcoding.org/?fromDate=2024-09-02&amp;toDate=2024-09-08&amp;channel=linking-together&amp;filter=#2024-09-05T18:40:02.747Z" class="date">2024-09-05 18:40:02</a> <div class="message"><p>Here's my understanding of what's going on with the Realtalk source (based on scattered readings over the past day).</p>
<p>At one point (2019-ish), Realtalk was this giant "poster" made up of sheets of paper with fiducials (the dots), each page representing an object (in memory) that could perform some computation. So a few of these sheets of paper, working together, might enable the "identify fiducials" behaviour, by communicating with each other, each of them doing a tiny bit of computation. Some of them might represent some piece of supporting tech, like a sensor (eg camera) or an actuator (eg projector), and act like an API to that thing. One of the things you could do in this setup was point a keyboard object (with its own fiducials) at one of these sheets of paper, and edit the wishes and claims that constitute the computation that that sheet of paper possesses. That means if there's actual """code""" printed on that piece of paper, the code is now out of sync with the real "object" (in memory), but that's fine ‚Äî you could just wish for a new version of that object to be printed as code on paper, take down the old one, and put up the new one, and now they're back in sync.</p>
<p>Then, in 2020, after the pandemic, they needed a way to take Realtalk home with them. So instead of doing all this on a poster, they condensed it down to a binder. Crucially, the pieces of paper don't always need to be visible at all times ‚Äî the paper (or any object) is just a physical representation of its own behaviour. So you can pull out the paper and let a camera see it if you want to work on that object's behaviour, but when you're not working on it, you can tuck it into a binder. The object still exists. (I think there's some nuance here, since some objects do need to be visible in order for their computation to run, but I think that's, like, a choice of trigger, to put it in eToys speak).</p>
<p>Now, with Realtalk 2024, they're trying to get further away from the "textual code on pieces of paper with fiducials" bits, by making it so that you don't need (A) the fiducials to track objects, (B) the pieces of paper ‚Äî bits of behaviour can be manipulated readily by other kinds of representation, eg drawings ‚Äî and (C) the textual code, or at least not the sort of textual code they've been using thus far, which is basically some existing language (python, JS, C, etc) with a DSL for wish/claim.</p>

<p>re: ‚Äúit seems much easier to not make messes in digital spaces‚Äù</p>
<p>A basic hypothesis of Dynamicland is that we‚Äôve collectively made a big, awful mess in our shared digital space. It‚Äôs so easy to sweep complexity under the rug and pretend it doesn‚Äôt exist when it‚Äôs all neatly packed into the PulseAudio source tree or whatever. Using physical space enforces a discipline of simplicity and understandability. (So it is, in a sense, a ‚Äúhairshirt‚Äù, but we wouldn‚Äôt agree that ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need [it] in digital spaces‚Äù. Also, it‚Äôs a very comfy and pleasant hairshirt. :D)</p>

</div> <div class="attachments"><blockquote><p>üìù <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Advanced_Technology_Group">Apple Advanced Technology Group</a></p>
<p>The Advanced Technology Group (ATG) was a corporate research laboratory at Apple Computer from 1986 to 1997. ATG was an evolution of Apple's Education Research Group (ERG) and was started by Larry Tesler in October 1986 to study long-term research into future technologies that were beyond the time frame or organizational scope of any individual product group. Over the next decade, it was led by David Nagel, Richard LeFaivre, and Donald Norman.  It was known as Apple Research Labs during Norman's tenure as VP of the organization.  Steve Jobs closed the group when he returned to Apple in 1997.
ATG had research efforts in both hardware and software, with groups focused on such areas as Human-Computer Interaction, Speech Recognition (by Kai-Fu Lee), Educational Technology, Networking, Information Access, Distributed Operating systems, Collaborative Computing, Computer Graphics, and Language/action perspective.  Many of these efforts are described in a special issue of the ACM SIGCHI Bulletin which provided a retrospective of the ATG work after the lab was shut down.  ATG was also home to four Apple Fellows: Al Alcorn, object-oriented software pioneer; Alan Kay; Bill Atkinson; Donald Norman; and laser printer inventor Gary Starkweather.  Further, ATG funded university research and, starting in 1992, held an annual design competition for teams of students.

Would love to see some of you there. It'll be quite small (100-ish capacity) but loaded with great talks and conversations. We'll also be doing a more full-size conference in May next year. The vibes are "future of computing" and "spiritual successor to Strange Loop" with a more socio-political bent.</p>
<p>Also, there is a <a href="https://causalislands.getgrist.com/forms/4n86BCQeVyR3EsBMEDqjTK/7">CfP</a> up if you want to submit a presentation!</p>
<p>(I'm aware this isn't the perfect channel for this, but <strong>#in-germany</strong> felt too quiet... happy to move it if desired)</p>

<p>i found the resulting frame of programming as translation work of ‚Äúmapping one culture to another‚Äù provocative too!</p>

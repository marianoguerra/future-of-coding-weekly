What could physical squishiness allow a computer to communicate to a programmer, or vice versa? Could the degree of softness mean something? Could interacting with a soft thing allow you to express something that you couldn't if that thing were hard? Might the softness just change the way it  ~<em><em>feels</em></em>~ to do computation, so that the difference isn't some technical capability but rather a change of mindset or mood?</p>
<p>In other words, where does the softness go?</p>

<ul><li>B-trees are a bit squishy/sticky in how nodes get joined/split.  So are all structures with  <em>amortization</em> ?  But that's a well-encapsulated property, hardly observable.</li><li>Cuckoo hashes get harder to insert into (more pushing stuff around) as they fill up.  That's observable as a slow-down (like regular hash tables) but still correct.  Well, unlike regular hash tables at some point the guarantee that you only need to check N places really breaks down, but I suppose then you resize and re-hash the whole thing, so the effect is "slow down with amortized resize" similar to regular hashes.</li><li>Bloom filters get  <em>less precise</em>  as they fill up.  Now that's really observable to the user.  So do other "sketch" structures.  But frequently they're used behind some other fallback (e.g. cache miss=&gt;do the network request) that reduce the observable imprecision to observable slowdown.</li></ul><p>So in all those, squishiness might come handy to visualize algorithm  <em>internals</em> , but doesn't map to anything desirable in the final product of computation?</p>
<p>Speaking of visualizations, spring-model layouts are handy for evolving graphs (e.g. <a href="https://gource.io/">gource.io</a>) and are also promising for real-time "collaboration" between automated + human-moved layout, because mechanics are intuitive and predictable to our brain.</p>

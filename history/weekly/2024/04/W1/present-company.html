Probably something like setting up Arch Linux on a Mac, booting off a USB thumbdrive?</p>
<p>I am seeing lots of youngsters growing up with tablets and smartphones with no conception of files or processes. This seems worrying for the future of coding, but I don't know of any resources that I can recommend.</p>

"Files" and "desktops" are old-fashioned, 1940s concepts glued onto a new phenomenon. Furthermore, the concepts of "operating system" and, even, "functional notation" might be unnecessarily old fashioned. The future of "coding" may suffer by such lack of knowledge of files and processes, but, the future of "programming" may benefit from this.</p>

<p>I do think that Mac and Windows have tended to dumb down their systems in the garb of "protecting" the user. The other advantage of linux is that it more closely resembles what typically runs on servers.</p>

It's sort of like a capture-the-flag game, but it's very ground-up. It starts with teaching you how to SSH at all, if I recall correctly. Do it from a desktop Linux client, and they'll probably get the idea eventually. I think I only did a few levels before I got bored/went back to work. (If you do this, please let me know how it goes. I've been saving the link in case I need to teach someone Linux but don't know for sure how well it works).</p>

Anyone involved in the  <em>near</em>  future of coding needs to understand them.</p>
<p>Are people really going to try to say you shouldn't try to understand the layers under you, or past attempts at problems we want to solve? That's not what I expect from this community.</p>

<p>My reasoning was simple:</p>
<ul><li>Bitcoin has crashed several times.  It always recovers better than it was before.</li><li>Other coins follow the whims of Bitcoin, but with much bigger swings.</li><li>Buy something relatively stable/mature, and enjoy a bigger multiplier 'on the way back up'.</li></ul><p>So I bought SOL at the 'bottom', and some ADA, and I'm going to cash in at some point soon, and wait for another crash....  The halving is happening this month, and history says that the price will likely climb beyond it, but I'm not relying on it.</p>
<p>The danger of this strategy is that SOL might suffer some fundamental failure; and perhaps Bitcoin is more stable; hard to tell on that one.  A good compromise would be to buy a more diverse spread of top performing coins at the bottom; ADA, BNB, XRP, AVAX, etc....</p>
<p>The advantage, as <strong>@Alex McLean</strong> says is that SOL is proof of stake, like Ethereum.  The biggest negative against SOL is that it is seen to be less centralized, because becoming a miner requires a bigger pot and lots of fast hardware.  They all have their issues though.  ADA's tech isn't scaling very well currently, BNB is tied to Binance which might get regulated, etc.  XRP is more 'corporate', etc.</p>
<p>The nice part of this strategy is that (compared to my previous efforts), it is relatively stress-free.  Buy at the bottom, wait 3-4 years, sell, repeat.  April is going to be an interesting month regardless....</p>

This deserves reposting. This explains why we can't have good software.</p>
<p>The first thing this makes me think of is Chromium. Obviously Chromium has a recently formed sidebar team that by accident has the privilige to push a new and poorly thought through feature of the month to a billion users with every release without checking if any of the other teams has thought of a better way to do it in the last 15 years of Chromium.</p>
<p>The second thing it makes me think of is Gnome Text Editor, which is the default text editor in Ubuntu. It's based on the faulty idea that one team can make a shared library of GUI components that are universally applicable to all apps, and other teams can make apps by composing shared components and not making their own. As a result, Gnome Text Editor is based on the source view component in GTK, and it's terribly buggy, and the bugs cannot be fixed, because the text editor team and the GTK team don't communicate with each other.</p>

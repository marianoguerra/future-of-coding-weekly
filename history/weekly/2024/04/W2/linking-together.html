<p>Every week I will dump from tinyletter and re upload one month of the <a href="https://newsletter.futureofcoding.org/">Future of Coding Newsletter</a> and publish it as a message here, that way we can all go over past conversations and links and I have a reason and rhythm to make them available again.</p>

<blockquote><p>I believe the point is to turn the DOM into an optional module. If you're making a website that is structured, you'd probably still want to use the DOM.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think proposal means that the DOM is going away. People are not making plain old websites anymore. They're throwing in at least some React even if they're making something simple.</p>
<p>React is a weird thing that shouldn't have to exist. It takes an internal single-use DOM and translates it to commands to manipulate the external long-lived DOM that React developers don't want to touch. This translation is a lot of complexity and very very leaky abstraction that exists for no reason other than backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>Instead of doing this unnecessary translation, every framework is going to make their own stateless immediate mode renderer, say they had to do so as to free developers from having to deal with different bugs in different DOM implementations, and then say that  you can use the same renderer both for native apps and for the web, and that by the way, their own renderer runs 10x faster on every benchmark.</p>

<blockquote><p>Web scraping in general?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just use Aria somehow.</p>
<blockquote><p>Element-based ad blocking?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Use Aria. Another interesting approach would be to make a tracing Wasm interpreter that can determine which pixel on the screen was derived from which byte received from an ad server and can automatically find all relevant Wasm code on the way from the ad server to the pixel so it can be disassembled and patched.</p>
<blockquote><p>And the inspectability of websites via browser dev tools?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every framework is going to add dev tool interoparability just as hardware manufacturers add Jtag.</p>

<p>Posting ideas in a place where public discussion can take place seems like an excellent way to get open feedback or review. I encourage other programmers to do the same. Perhaps,  <code>/&lt;username&gt;/request-for-hacks</code>  can become a standard way to discover these. üôÇ</p>

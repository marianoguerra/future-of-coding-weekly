<blockquote><p>Snake-case would have avoided the ambiguity, but is a little slower to type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it? Did you measure? I did, and after five tries of typing with hyphens, my best time was 11% slower than the first try typing with underscores. Same reason as your reason to use dots for field accessors.</p>
<p>Underscores avoid not only the syntactic ambiguity, but also a linguistic one. Hyphens naturally occur in words such as ‚Äú32-bit‚Äù and ‚Äúself-reference‚Äù. Writing things like ‚Äúaddress-of‚Äù and ‚Äúdo-twice‚Äù is grammatically incorrect. Underscores on the other hand have no other meaning than to separate words in tokens.</p>
<p>I have a suggestion of something that is better than underscores for real: Spaces. ‚Äú <em>address of</em> ‚Äù is so much nicer than ‚Äú _address<em>of</em> ‚Äù, or even worse ‚Äú <em>address-of</em> ‚Äù. Spaces are also the fastest to type, as there is a large spacebar where the two strongest fingers are resting all the time, in contrast to the key for hyphens and underscores that requires an excursion with the pinkie.</p>

<p>In my experience, spaces between tokens make it clear:  <code>std .child process .exec</code> </p>
<p>I'm also using a a variable-space font, so ‚Äústd.child_process.exec‚Äù and ‚Äústd.child-process.exec‚Äù also have too little space between the tokens in comparison to the big underscore or hyphen within the token.</p>

<blockquote><p>‚ÄúWhere a number of issues are being taken into account in a design decision, inevitably the ones which can be most clearly expressed carry the greatest weight, and are best reflected in the form. Other factors, important too but less well expressed, are not so well reflected. Caught in a net of language of our own invention, we overestimate the language‚Äôs impartiality. Each concept, at the time of its invention no more than a concise way of grasping many issues, quickly becomes a precept. We take the step from description to criterion too easily, so that what is at first a useful tool becomes a bigoted preoccupation. [‚Ä¶]</p>

<p>In this fashion the selfconscious individual's grasp of problems is constantly misled. His concepts and categories, besides being arbitrary and unsuitable, are self-perpetuating. Under the influence of concepts, he not only does things from a biased point of view, but sees them biasedly as well. The concepts control his perception of fit and misfit- until in the end he sees nothing but deviations from his conceptual dogmas, and loses not only the urge but even the mental opportunity to frame his problems more appropriately.‚Äù</p>

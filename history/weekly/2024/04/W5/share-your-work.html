<pre><code>What exactly is Glamorous Toolkit?



To some people Glamorous Toolkit is a Pharo environment. To others it's a knowledge management system. Others might see a code analysis platform, a data visualization or an API browsing tool. Yet others see the graphical stack with its interactive editors. Glamorous Toolkit is all of these. But it's really also none of these. These are merely examples of the many forms the environment can be molded to. And there can be many more. Glamorous Toolkit is primarily an environment that makes it possible to create many experiences seamlessly and contextually. This then leads to a new way of programming that we call Moldable Development.</code></pre><p>Join remotely here: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ukstug/events/300575234/">meetup.com/ukstug/events/300575234</a></p>

<p>It threw me off that moving one of the sliders moved the other slider! At first I thought it was some weird bug. Now I see that they‚Äôre both actually 2D sliders. That‚Äôs kinda confusing. It‚Äôs interesting! Maybe there‚Äôs something there. But: kinda confusing.</p>
<p>It seems like you‚Äôre interested here in ‚Äúparallel representations‚Äù ‚Äì seeing the torus as a square (with identified opposite sides), as a 3D object, and as the configuration space of a pair of sliders. I‚Äôd really like to see more of that. For instance, in the ‚ÄúInput Spaces‚Äù section, could you show a point on a 3D torus alongside the two reps you have already?</p>

<p>Molecular simulations are mainly done in hypertorus geometries, meaning a 3D space resulting from the Cartesian product of three circles. Teaching this is quite challenging. I never thought of using a paper torus for illustration, but next time I will!</p>

Its so interesting to hear that molecular simulations are done in S1^3! I have an idea for illustrating this space as well, but I was avoiding getting into 3D rendering for this post.</p>
<p>Why do people do molecular simulations in that space? It would be strange to me if a molecule was connected as a circle across the entire space since I don't know what would correspond to in real life.</p>

Even a drop of water is too large to simulate. Moreover, simulating a complete drop would be of no interest (for reason that I can go into if you want, but that involves quite some details about modelling liquids).</p>
<p>So we simulate a finite volume, and even a rather small one. What shape should it have? And what should be around it? There is no good answer to the shape question as the volume is much too small to be realistic anyway. And if we put walls around it, we make a system much too small to show certain forms of motion, such as slow diffusion. So it's best not to have walls at all.</p>
<p>Conclusion: we use 3D hypersurfaces, i.e. the surfaces of some 4D volume. Finite volume, and yet without boundaries. Both hypertori and hypersheres have been used, but hypertori won because they cause fewer unwanted artifacts.</p>

Personally I don't. They are interesting mostly for simulating chemical reactions. But even for "classical" simulations, it's not reasonable to aim for realistic volumes. A small drop of water, say 0.05 ml, has 10^{21} water molecules. Most properties of water for which the molecular scale matters can be computed with 1000 molecules on a hypertorus. And if you are interested in the specificities of the droplet, for things like surface tension, a continuum mechanics simulation (fluid dynamics, as used for engineering) is both cheaper and provides more insight.</p>

<p>re: clone dot comment: I hadn't thought about this torus example! I would need 3 clones, interesting! I like this point you're making.</p>
<p>I was on the fence about the clone dot because it feels kind-of magic-y and less like "there's just a point moving around" from a programming perspective.</p>
<p>re: circular RP2 interactive comment: I also played around with this circulation around the edge of the circle lol. Yea, I kind of know what you mean about the path dependence. If it wasn't path dependent, then I would have a continuous map f: Screen Plane -&gt; Disk, probably such that f(Disk) = Disk, is there a map like that?</p>
<p>And whoa!! This post about hysterisis is super cool. I love how I can see that the space of these points joined by slack is parameterized by a rhombus. Also how the space is like two lines (vertical sides of the rhombus) connected by a line at each corresponding point and how the connecting lines don't connect to eachother.</p>
<p>re: 3D: you're right. I will do it. I'm gonna continue on my 2D journey for a bit more tho, because if I do 3D I will want to add point picking and interaction and I think I want to do raytracing to avoid triangle artifacts.</p>
<p>re: wacky puzzle: had to think about this a bit. Is this space equivalent to an infinitely tall cylinder? Let theta be the angle of a point on the cylinder and h be its height; the corresponding line is perpendicular to the vector, in polar coords (h, 2*theta).</p>
<p>edit: no, this is really wrong lol. I was thinking about how from each line through the origin there's a real line worth of lines parallel to it.</p>
<p>edit2: found this <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1848739/a-topology-on-the-set-of-lines/1848770#1848770">math.stackexchange.com/questions/1848739/a-topology-on-the-set-of-lines/1848770#1848770</a>.</p>
<p>and I see that I was on the right track that locally it looks like each point is on a circle and a line, but I was missing the global twist in the space.</p>

<p>Instead of just spinners or the raw stream of text like chat UIs, we overlay this visualization where the design will appear on the canvas. Each visualization reflects a design variant that Copilot works on, and is computed in real-time based on the token streams from the LLM.</p>

<p>On my computer, dragging those lines &amp; circles selects number text, which is distracting. I think some <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/user-select">user-select: none</a> should fix that.</p>

<p>Dave Ackley’s paper Beyond Efficiency is three pages long. With just these three pages, he mounts a compelling argument against the conventional way we engineer software. Instead of inflexibly insisting upon correctness, maybe allow a lil slop? Instead of chasing peak performance with cache and clever tricks, maybe measure many times before you cut. So in this episode, we’re putting every CEO in the guillotine… (oh, that stands for “correctness and efficiency only”, don’t put us on a list)… and considering when, where, and how to do the robust thing.</p>

Thanks for mentioning it! I found a copy at</p>
<p><a href="https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb10-4/tb26complete.pdf">tug.org/TUGboat/tb10-4/tb26complete.pdf</a></p>
<p>Knuth invented a new kind of documentation, one that hardly anyone uses, but that is specifically designed for communicating how a program works to other human beings.</p>
<p>Knuth has also expended great effort in the study of other people's code and programs, including code written in long dead programming languages.</p>
<p>If there is anyone in the world capable of transcending the limits described by Peter Naur, both by transmitting the theory of a program and by recreating it, it would be Donald Knuth. I see no reason to doubt the truth of Knuth's claims, but I also don't see them as contradicting Naur.</p>
<p>Naur does not claim it is impossible to revive a program in practical terms, only that it is difficult, frustrating, and time-consuming, and "may lead to a revived theory that differs from the one originally had by the program authors and so may contain discrepancies with the program text." I believe his point is that you cannot be certain the revived theory is the same as the original theory, however I do not have enough experience with literate programming to judge Knuth's claim that a well-written literate program might have a good chance of being accurately revived.</p>
<p>Calling the stored program computer a "von Neumann model" does a tremendous disservice to J. Presper Eckert who invented and wrote up the idea around 6 months before von Neumann joined the ENIAC project. See the book A History of Computing in the
Twentieth Century for a copy of the original memo.</p>
<p>von Neumann wrote a draft report that was widely shared informally (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Draft_of_a_Report_on_the_EDVAC">en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Draft_of_a_Report_on_the_EDVAC</a>), but to the best of my knowledge he never claimed the ideas were his. He was writing up the ENIAC team's plans for the EDVAC.</p>
<p>Y'all may also enjoy von Neumann's paper "PROBABILISTIC LOGICS AND THE SYNTHESIS OF RELIABLE</p>
<p>ORGANISMS FROM UNRELIABLE COMPONENTS." <a href="https://static.ias.edu/pitp/archive/2012files/Probabilistic_Logics.pdf">static.ias.edu/pitp/archive/2012files/Probabilistic_Logics.pdf</a></p>

<p>Overall the contention between correctness, efficiency, and robustness seems to arise from the viewpoint that correctness is a binary proposition rather than a probabilistic measurement of the values we want our software to achieve. If we have a myopic view of correctness we’re leaving all the tradeoffs off the table.</p>

<blockquote><p>... during lengthy computations, the accumulation of errors due to things like imperfectly constructed components, thermal fluctuations, and random outside influences makes analogue computers wander off the intended computational path. This may sound like a minor or parochial consideration. But it is quite the opposite. Without error-correction all information processing, and hence all knowledge-creation, is necessarily bounded. ... So all universal computers are digital; and all use error-correction with the same basic logic that I have just described, though with many different implementations. Thus Babbage’s computers assigned only ten different meanings to the whole continuum of angles at which a cogwheel might be oriented. Making the representation digital in that way allowed the cogs to carry out error-correction automatically: after each step, any slight drift in the orientation of the wheel away from its ten ideal positions would immediately be corrected back to the nearest one as it clicked into place. Assigning meanings to the whole continuum of angles would nominally have allowed each wheel to carry (infinitely) more information; but, in reality, information that cannot be reliably retrieved is not really being stored.</p>

Such projects have basically always failed, for running out of steam before accomplishing anything useful.</p>
<p>One of the insights from John Gall's "Systems Bible" (highly recommended!) is (chapter 11):  "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked" with the corollary that "A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work. you have to start over, beginning with a working simple system."</p>
<p>That's in fact how today's computing systems evolved over a few decades. The result is a bit of a mess, but it works. And it's so big by now that it cannot be replaced, only evolved.</p>

<p>I actually don't want to have to "make something big", because yeah, I've also seen countless examples of things of this scale failing (or worse, leaving a stain on its surroundings... (cough) Windows Registry). I don't want to have to make an OS, but having the entire software ecosystem playing to the same conceptual tune is going to make things all the more sound - if that makes sense.</p>
<p>Making a VM of it, in the same way as Unison or Scrapscript are doing (if I'm understanding them correctly), is where I'd want to start too. So I think I'm going to reach out to the authors of both and ask what they think about scaling them up.</p>

<ul><li>why the only copilot we have is for VSCode</li><li>why not every app is end-user programmable</li></ul><p>I wondered the same thing, and I’ve built (<a href="https://omnipilot.ai">omnipilot.ai</a>), an AI copilot that works everywhere on macOS.</p>
<p>Specifically it lets you invoke GPT to type into any app ( <em>particularly interesting to me is it works great in Xcode</em> ), can also autocomplete text in any app, and lets you chat with GPT-4 with context from your recent apps. I’d really appreciate any feedback or first impressions!</p>
<p>Re end-user programmability I’m also working on making it more possible for people to make little “automations” on their computer, whether it’s adding buttons to Finder to convert files or recording little AI-enhanced macros.</p>
<p>Some specific questions I’d love feedback:</p>
<ul><li>How often do you find yourself wanting help editing code outside of a Github Copilot-enabled environment? What are those situations or apps?</li><li>What about text, do you wish you had a copilot for text too?</li><li>What do you think of the “works everywhere” approach vs. a dedicated app?</li><li>Do the AI-macros sound appealing or meh?</li><li>Any thoughts on the landing page copy/design?</li></ul><p>I’m also happy to answer any other questions. Thanks in advance for sharing your thoughts, it’s super helpful in shaping the product!</p>

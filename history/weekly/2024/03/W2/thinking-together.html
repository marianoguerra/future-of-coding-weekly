That's why they're hard to design and engineer!</p>
<p>The physicality of software is kept at arms-length in a vector-based design tool. Here, the strength and focus is on surface level aesthetics and exploration though mocks ‚Äî many, many mocks. All needed. All useful. But a mock does not a product make. A mock is an incomplete story of software physics. Which brings us the other side of the spectrum...</p>
<p>The IDEs ‚Äî the code editors. The product you ship is here, so "I guess someone has to go there". First challenge: To most people it's walls of inexplicable symbols and weird (even hostile?) punctuation. Then, with code, you're essentially play-acting as a computer. You have to "speak computer" fluently to feel at home here. It's a love/hate relationship of running programs in your head. Mostly failing to do so. Then learning to get better at debugging. Eureka moments of finally solving the puzzle that unlocks a bugfix! Endlessly restarting programs to reset state. Today, even after multiple decades of investment in IDEs, coding is still 100 times harder and less fun than it should be! How can we truly move the needle?</p>
<p>A traditional IDE deals with the how to fully describe the physics of a software system. Writing and editing algorithms. Managing data flows. Figuring out logic. Painting pixels. Sending data at the speed of light over the network. But the IDE doesn't actually let you  <em>see</em>  the program as it manifests to the user in the final medium. It's running somewhere else ‚Äî the browser, on your phone. This is where vector-tools have the IDEs at least partially beat. Yes, they're just mocks, but the vector-tool tool  <em>sees</em>  the mocks alongside you. This changes your relationship with the tool. Thinking and touching ‚Äî moving, dragging, scaling, rotating, duplicating ‚Äî seamlessly blends on a canvas, and it just  <em>feels</em>   <em>good, even fun!</em>  IDEs and editing code as text offers none of those things with today's tools, and it just feels like... friction!</p>
<p>So the letter to Santa reads as follows:</p>
<p> <em>Dear Santa, give me the best parts of a vector-based design tool, plus the best parts of an IDE, rolled into one ‚Äî but with none of the downsides. Thanks!</em> </p>
<p>Christmas can't get here fast enough.</p>

(1) Choose a textual language+library (something like Javascript) that produced PDF files for printing, (2) Create a graphical UI and a piece of code that "compiles" the UI to the chosen language ("transpilation", "t2t"). I'm currently doing something like that to make a DPL using <a href="http://draw.io">draw.io</a> compiled to a textual language (currently Odin, but CL, Javascript, Python in the past). Not exactly rocket science, given that <a href="http://draw.io">draw.io</a> (et al) produces XML text representing the diagrams and given that text parsing technology took a huge leap forward with OhmJS (and PEG).</p>

A vector tool lets you work without a blindfold, but it doesn't let you design the laws of physics.</p>
<p>Should we make an IDE that doesn't blindfold, or should we make a vector tool that lets you design the laws of physics?</p>
<p>Sure, these might converge to the same thing. But where should you start?</p>
<p>I used to be on team "start at the IDE, make it visual".</p>
<p>Lately I've been on team "start at the vector tool, make it able to design physics".</p>
<p>Now, these two tools come with their own laws of physics already. The IDE's physics have no bearing on the software you make, just the experience you have trying to make it. But the vector tool's physics rub against the visual design you build. For instance, tldraw and after effects each let you mock your software to a radically different degree.</p>
<p>It might be easier to fix the janky physics in a drawing tool  ~<em><em>and</em></em>~  then make it malleable, than to make an IDE that lets you see what you're doing  ~<em><em>and</em></em>~  and doesn't rub against your work in a new and bad way.</p>

But they are also several other kinds of things at the same time.</p>
<p>There is something confusing going on, which often leads to discussions about different optimization strategies without realizing that we are talking about very different aspects of software, or different representations of it.</p>
<p>For instance, the user interface is pretty much all software is for the user, and there are practices to ‚Äúdo the right thing‚Äù to achieve a good user experience. But then as builders we look at how the software is made, which in most cases is source code. And for some of us that is all software is, although here we probably all agree that as developers we need to both consider the source code and the user interface together. But even though these are both ‚Äúthe software‚Äù, they follow very different ‚Äúphysics‚Äù and need to be taken care of in different ways.</p>

I belonged to a privileged class that knows a lot about building things with transistors and resistors and capacitors. Then, someone invented an API called "opcodes" which let more people design things with transistors and resistors and capacitors. It seems - to me - that the technical problem of building the dream IDE is characterized by creating 2 sets of APIs and letting the domain experts do their thing on either side of the APIs. Each API would need to have 2 directions - output and input (GUI-&gt;ide, ide-&gt;GUI, IDE-&gt;gui, gui-&gt;IDE), kinda like UNIX command pipelines with a better syntax and the possibility for "feedback". API design is the same thing as Opcode design.  Opcodes tend to KISS, whereas APIs have become too complicated and riddled with nuance.</p>

Let's see if I can explain it.</p>
<ul><li>There are programs, like photoshop, that are tools for artists. You can use them to make art. They're a digital equivalent of traditional art tools. The fact that they're digital has, just to give one example, enabled artists to easily do some things that used to be really hard. This has, in turn, changed the sort of art that gets made.</li></ul><ul><li>There are programs, like flash, that are tools for <u>___</u> to make tools for artists. (I'm leaving a blank there because… I could have said "programmers", but I actually want you to not think of them as programmers for a sec. Just go with me.) For example, in the late 00s, I worked as a <em><em>__</em></em> making tools for artists, and I used flash to do this, because it gave me a programming environment that was designed in tandem with a drawing environment. Really nice fit here. But flash wasn't really designed for people to make tools for artists. It was designed to be a tool for artists, but it was also programmable, which made it a good tool for making tools for artists.</li></ul><ul><li>There are —————, that are tools for making tools for <em><em>__</em></em> to make tools for artists. (I'm adding another blank. I could have said "programming languages", but I actually want you to not think of these  <em>—————s</em>  as programming languages for a sec. Just go with me.) For example, going to school, or reading books, or a good night's sleep, or taking a shower, or having a stimulating conversation with a friend. These are all —————, but they're outside the computer.</li></ul><p>Just as the computer allowed artists to have a new kind of tool that changed the sort of art that got made, I'm interested in how the computer might give us new kinds of ——————, which would in turn make new kinds of <u><u>_</u></u>.</p>
<p>It's possible that FoC as a community is a —————. But I also think there's ————— software that's  <em>not</em>  a programming language.</p>

Well, some of it probably doesn't depend on what kind of end-tools they are — project planning, remote work, open source, undo/redo, VCS, data vis are all broadly helpful.

It's hard for me to express, but I'll keep trying. I'm not interested in doing "anything". I'm interested in something very specific — I just want to find, like, one such thing.

<p>Before we had Photoshop, you could do coding to achieve similar goals. Before we had Flash (HyperCard, Dreamweaver, etc), you could do coding to achieve similar goals. Before we had Maya, or AutoCAD, Sketchpad, or other tools for visually expressing constraints, you could do coding to achieve similar goals. (I switched from saying "programming" to saying "coding" because Photoshop, flash, maya, etc are all still  ~<em><em>programming</em></em>~ , they just quite different from status quo  ~<em><em>coding</em></em>~ ).</p>
<p>We don't have ————, so you can do coding to achieve similar goals. In this case, the goal is making the next Flash, Maya, HyperCard, spreadsheet, desktop metaphor, etc (to the extent that making those involves coding. It also involves invention, but I see that part as essential and the coding as accidental)</p>

But I only made progress once I enlarged focus from tools (at whatever meta-level) to the people using the tools, to the activities of those people, and to the knowledge embedded in the tools.</p>
<p>One conclusion from that perspective is that  the number of meta-levels in tooling should be the same as the number of meta-levels in people's specializations (Conway's law). Which may of course evolve over time. In particular, new technologies/tools can lead to a new meta-level of specialization. That may or may not be a good thing. Specialization leads to higher complexity in social structures, increasing efficiency but reducing resilience and autonomy. Do artists value more new tools to have fun with more or less than tools that they can control and shape themselves? I don't know.</p>

<p>One can think of "baking" as requiring (1) heat, and, (2) mushy stuff that can be shaped.</p>
<p>If you incidentally want the baked thing to taste good, you make the mushy stuff out of flour, water and salt.</p>

<p>It seems to me that it is difficult to do FoC until you upgrade PoC to PoC (Past of C, Present of C, resp.). Note that the ground rules for Present-of-C are now  <em>very</em>  different than they were when Past-of-C was first invented, e.g. we don't need time-sharing due to  <code>$$$</code>  and we don't need to worry about about heaps/GC/malloc/memory-sharing due to  <code>$$$</code>  and we are allowed to overlap cells (e.g. "characters" and beyond). Old-time notation uses the simplifying assumption of tossing out  <em>time</em>  to allow equations to be written down on papyrus. The new medium allows us to add back "t" and "z" and to explore phenomena that are inconvenient when stripped down to written equations on papyrus. We are indoctrinated - by 2000+ years of using papyrus - to think that we must use only papyrus and writing utensils, thus, we find it difficult to invent new ways to use this new medium.</p>

We don't start with primitives of the system and design a system around that and then figure out  a way to work our way up. Instead, we start from the beginning with all the capabilities of modern computers. Hosted on top of high level systems (more often than not today, in the browser).</p>
<p>Focusing on this high level setup first (flash is a great example of such a tool), creates a usable system faster, but fails to have the properties that generalize in the way that programming languages have. I don't think this is an accidental property. It took us a long time of working with lower level language to figure out good abstractions for the higher level ones. To figure out how they should be implemented, to figure out idioms, etc. We are still in the process of getting better at this.</p>
<p>I think, if we began at the lower level, we'd have a greater chance of over time. slowly, discovering those things. I think there is this temptation that because we want to get away from coding and all that we bring with it, we also want to get rid of the details of the computer. But I think that's a mistake. We don't even know what the assembly of coding-but-not is. We don't know how to go from a higher-level coding-but-not representation, into a lower level coding-but-not representation. So we are stuck relying on code when we want to make these systems fast, or interoperate with existing things.</p>
<p>Imagine a system that is coding-but-not, but can interop with the unixy-C world we have today. That can compete with C on speed. That can interact with the computer in any way coding-that-is-code can. Now we can start making the tools for others to make tools without needing to leave our ecosystem of coding-but-not.</p>

<p>I have a big question about a programming-related problem I only partly understand, hoping not to get an answer, but rather pointers to where I should be looking. Here it goes.</p>
<p>For the past two years I have been working on SplootCode wanting to make code more accessible to non-engineers. The initial product (as is today) is basically a structured editor with drag and drop a-la-Scratch capabilities, and some other things to help non-engineers see and understand what the code is doing. You can see an example tiny program <a href="https://app.splootcode.io/shared/mattia/for-loops-example/EPdLhGOx7p1SbPDIDisgbfpV">here</a>.</p>
<p>During the interviews I conducted with several people, I bumped into a non-native English speaker who revealed their frustrations with having to learn English in order to code.</p>
<p>After speaking to another dozen non-native speakers - some of whom teach programming in non-English speaking countries using their native language - I figured that this is a really big problem for a lot people, and I want to solve it.</p>
<p>Since I have been deep into SplootCode for over two years, I am sure that I am suffering from sunk cost fallacy like crazy, thus the reason I am asking the question here is to get some outside perspective.</p>
<hr><p>So, to solve the problem for people, I am wanting to address the nested problem that – AFAIK – the vast majority of programming languages, with the exclusion of any purely symbolic ones, are effectively a subset of the English language.</p>
<p>My first train of thoughts was: “perfect use case for building on top of SplootCode! The structured editing part means half the work is done already since I can label keywords however I want”.</p>
<p>Followed by: “but wait! how can this be actually solved so that anyone can use their own tool of choice, which is what people will need?”</p>
<hr><p>Thus my question is:</p>
<p>I believe that the proper solution is to add a  <em>layer</em> * to code – call the  <code>tongue</code>  layer – that defines the  <em>label</em> ** for each  <code>tongue</code> .</p>
<p> <em>What do I need to understand thoroughly, in order to build such a solution? Who should I speak to?</em> </p>
<ul><li><em>layer</em>  intended as a standalone structure that doesn’t interact with anything but the semantic label of any literal, variable, operator, or function (or any other atomic structure that may exist within a programming language)</li></ul><p>** <em>label</em>  intended as the human-readable part of an atomic structure of a program. For example, the  <code>if</code>  in the structure  <code>if () {}</code>  in javascript, would be  <code>se</code>  in Italian, and  <code>もし</code>  in Japanese.</p>

<p>So one lens here is that you "just" need to perform this internationalization process to a compiler codebase..</p>

If so, then you want to dig into technologies that make text-to-text-transformation easy, e.g. PEG parsing, LLMs (large language models "AI"), macros (you can learn about macros in Lisp, but lisp uses Lists instead of Text for macros). For PEG, I would suggest OhmJS (pdubroy on ohmland discord <a href="https://discord.gg/7FqKRZdv">discord.gg/7FqKRZdv</a>, and <a href="http://ohmjs.org">ohmjs.org</a>) and LLMs (elimisteve on ohmland and programming simplicity discords (<a href="https://discord.gg/ZEy2ajN3XQ">discord.gg/ZEy2ajN3XQ</a>)) (and, TXL (Source Transformation Language by James Cordy) <a href="http://txl.ca">txl.ca</a>) and the fields of Program Transformation and meta-programming. I have been dabbling in this sort of stuff and would be happy to elucidate (including a DSL for t2t for use alongside OhmJS). (REGEX and CFGs look tantalizingly close, but aren't as good at this as Ohm and PEG and LLMs). Note that OhmJS can do more than just t2t transformation.</p>

<p>The language there has a graphical symbolic representation and a text representation that, as far as I can tell, is not language-specific.</p>
<p>I think <a href="https://github.com/wordplaydev/wordplay/blob/main/LANGUAGE.md">WordPlay</a> is also designed to be natural-language-agnostic?</p>
<p>None of that is probably all that useful to you for your own language except for inspiration. :-)</p>

A billion spreadsheet programmers are just fine with their spreadsheet editor and can always export their spreadsheets if they want to use a different one. The point of your structured editor is to make programming  <em>easier</em>  by the very fact that it is a different  <em>kind</em>  of editor. If someone wants to program with a non-structured editor, you can give them their standard code without the tongue layer and they can go. And if someone else develops a different structured editor with something like your tongue layer, you can decide whether to export to their format.</p>

At least it's now possible to add input and output ports dynamically for existing compositions.</p>
<p>Since I also wanted to have some fun (and procastinate) I decided to implement a zoomable mandelbrot fractal in the gl-flow app, which can be seen in this little video <a href="https://youtu.be/y71c1IBBBsk">youtu.be/y71c1IBBBsk</a>. This also required some extra node-types and adjustments to the pull-based gl-flow engine. Like having support for a  for-loop-node which can be breaked out of depending on a condition. I implemented both the for-node as the condition as containers due to the way the pull-based engine works.</p>
<p>To give some background on the implementation of the pull-based flow engine which is used in the gl-flow app: the nodes get executed backwards starting at an end node and their output is glsl-code which can be run by a fragment shader on the gpu. So, the nodes themselves are not executed by the shader but the generated output is.</p>
<p>The spatial placement of the "end-nodes" is used to determine which node gets executed first and then the input nodes are executed backwards. A container is also an end-node. So, the contained nodes are executed in a code block.</p>
<p>I think the fractal renderer works quite nicely but you can't zoom very deep because of precision issues. I might try to solve these in the future, but my goal is not to make the perfect visual shadertoy😊.</p>

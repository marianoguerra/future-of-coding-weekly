We'd been DMing about <a href="./?fromDate=2023-12-29&amp;toDate=2024-01-04&amp;channel=thinking-together&amp;filter=#2024-01-01T21:17:17.966Z">💬 #thinking-together@2024-01-01T21:17:17.966Z</a>, keen to exchange our thoughts on a (new?) subtle kind of idea: those that can only be expressed (or received) by designing (or playing with) an interactive system. For instance, there's a subjective experience of interacting with a system, and I posit that this feeling engenders a kind of meaningful thought. So we set out to talk about this, and of course about some related things too (such as "the new physics" that exist inside the computer). Lots of fun. Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/stefanlesser">Stefan Lesser</a> for the chat, and for letting me share it as  <em>boco</em> . And thanks to all of you who support our effort to make the best, weirdest, most interesting podcast we can. Look forward to the next main episode… with a real  <em>subjective experience</em>  of soon-ness!</p>

There's only one "space" overall but you can have, say, rooms of your own in that. Every object (3D or 2D) will usually be in one main place, but also every object you see can be grabbed (referred to) by its link and dropped anywhere else you like, giving 2 or more incoming links to that object. Is that what you're asking?</p>

I think it makes sense for there to be some home for each object, as well as a way to refer to them from other locations, which seems like how you’re thinking about it.</p>

<p>I'm curious how you see your work in relation to version control. Which one subsumes the other, or how do they play together?</p>

<p>Currently on a code push to the main branch we identify the branch/path which has been affected by the push and identify that branch as potentially requiring more context. </p>
<p>There’s a lot more we can do with version control such as tagging branch states to commits and we’re always looking for angles. </p>

<p>Have you seen this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSqLt8BgbRQ">strangeloop talk</a> on using tests to find interesting subsets of the system? Seems quite a bit in line with what you are doing.</p>
<p>I've got to ask, was the direction of inspiration here truly from the episode to the tool? If that's awesome. If not, nice tie in 🙂</p>

<p>The Naur paper and episode were crucial to give us the clarity of thought and framework to start building in this particular direction.</p>

<p>First, my background:</p>
<ul><li>I am an academic.</li><li>I am not in CS, but in physics and chemistry.</li><li>I have been in academia for 30 years, and found it a good place for me back when I joined, but in today's conditions, I'd probably choose a different career.</li></ul><p>Many academics, myself included, mostly agree with your criticism. A good part of them, myself included, is working towards change in academia. But changing a system from the inside also requires surviving in the system, and that requires unpleasant compromises.</p>
<p>My partial disagreement is about "put it in the bin". In spite of academia's faults, I think the world is still better off with it than without it. Getting rid of academia would leave a vacuum that would rapidly be filled by profit-oriented corporations. Which is why I prefer reforming academia from inside, even if that it a slow process.</p>

<p>From the other side, most papers I read are sharing an idea, I have to spend a lot of work to extract the core idea from the paper format sometimes deciding if following the formalism is worth or not and then most of the time having to learn an ad-hoc notation only once to parse the formalism. Things that would make it much easier to "grok" like examples, demos, videos, actual runnable code in a repo instead of pseudo-code are almost always missing.</p>

<p>at the event, some people told me they'd love to see me write a paper about it because they want to see more detail about the nitty-gritty of the demo. "if your only tool is a hammer" and all that.</p>
<p>i think that papers can be great! the only claim I'm challenging around them is if they're the "only way" of having a long term effect. </p>
<p>again I'm making these challenges as a form of feedback, to try to help people make academia better</p>

<ul><li>I had some misgivings as well when I read that blog post, but trying to articulate them felt like setting out in a desert. Thank you for pitching base camp! My bottom-line decision was, if you want to persuade academics, Jonathan  <em>may</em>  be right. But that doesn't cover 10% of my desired target audience, so I didn't bother to think about it too closely.</li><li>There's a lot of status tied up in there, isn't there? Makes me wonder if going to an academic conference forty years hence might be like going to the opera today. What would the equivalent of Queen in the 60s be then? I think part of it will be, "send us stuff you've already published. Wherever, whatever format. We're just picking out an agenda to discuss in a compressed synchronous setting." Maybe call for attendees,  <em>then</em>  call for papers?</li><li>The format of a paper is excellent for a thorough exegesis of something. The process of writing it is 90% of the value of submitting to a conference for me. It forces me to think through things carefully (and no, I don't have to follow a LaTeX template). However, a) there are a lot of papers that shouldn't be papers just like there are a lot of books that shouldn't be books. There's some subjectivity here, but I suspect also some deeper thing a lot of people can agree about (if we were all willing to be so unkind out loud). Also, b) I find I can't force the paper writing process. I somehow got a PhD with a single workshop paper and no end of angst about the fact. Now it's a relief to be able to decide the time to write a paper. When the  <em>project</em>  needs it, rather than my career or some funding agency's schedule. Most of the time I  <em>don't know</em>  what I'm doing thoroughly enough to be able to write a paper about it. Perhaps trying to do so will advance things, but I think it has just as much chance of kneecapping them. Oh, and c) these thorough papers are explicitly discouraged at Onward, which is unfortunately coupling life cycle phase with audience.</li></ul><p>Wait, why is there so much sand around here. Dammit, I managed to get lost in the desert again.</p>

<p>So I want to view my code side-by-side-by-side at different levels of abstraction - on the left high-level abstractions, on the right ‚Äúderived‚Äù (built?) code. But it doesn‚Äôt have to be just one source and one build, there would be arbitrary number of layers. And then I can imagine direct manipulation of expanded/built code. Perhaps when you focus on a line of code, all upstream dependencies are brought into view. This allows you to choose the level of abstraction on which to make the edit. If you choose to edit derived code, then that automatically clones the current function scope.</p>
<p>Something about that feels kinda similar to a CAD function tree. Anyways, just throwing ideas out üôÇ</p>

It's a bit like a portal to another location. And this transclusion can be viewed in different ways, for example just as a function name, or as a short preview, or even the entire piece of code. These are different levels of abstractions.</p>

Let's say that reality is like a state computation machine. How would it be possible to create a more accurate model of reality than we have currently? It would have to go beyond words, and would have to include visual, kinaesthetic constructs. It would have to be a higher dimensional representation, to the extent that we as humans can perceive a higher dimensional representation. So this means, higher than the 1D text we have, or its 2D UI, single frame in time representation. This would look like some kind of 4D temporal model, where it's possible to see the execution of a program in its entirety, all at once.</p>
<p>It would not only show semantic relationships in a graph sense, but also model the data structures and their operation over time. So the idea of "stocks" of data, and "flows" of data (from Donella Meadows, Systems Thinking) would apply here. React.useState might be represented as a small orb of energy, and if we setState, then it would visually change. When we assign const a = b, then it would visually indicate a flow of information from b -&gt; a. I think this would be a much clearer representation of what a program is doing, and free up cognitive load to focus on more important tasks, as opposed to the programmer having to hold a mental model in their head. No matter how good a programmer is, if he or she possesses a better more accurate kinesthetic model of what is happening, their brain power is freed up to solve more problematic and relevant abstractions.</p>
<p>I've been mocking up a prototype of how this would work, and the basic idea is overlaying a tool like VSCode with "vibes" as well as flow relations. It's like an annotation layer over existing code, but this is just the basic start of how it would look like. Ultimately, it would look like a mini universe.</p>

I believe inline, rich text snippets which are integrated with some kind of personal knowledge management system is the way to go. This way, instead of having comments like this:</p>
<p>// TODO: Refactor this to use the revised approach</p>
<p>It instead would look like using Notion or Obsidian inside VSCode. So above a function, would be a small window into a single page that describes a single function. You can do anything here, like linking references that are relevant to the design of the function. Or you could even have a lengthy design document that explains why a function was written a certain way. Going even further, you could have a page which describes the evolution of a function over time, why at the beginning it was written a certain way, why changes had to be made, and why it looks the way it looks right now.</p>
<p>And added bonus of this approach is that now it's possible to have a single source of truth for docs and your code. So rather than maintaining a separate Docusaurus that has to be updated to sync it with evolution in code, you can just maintain documentation in line. And then to publish developer docs online, you merely just take all the little snippets above each function and then aggregate them onto a single page.</p>

Eg if you have a type annotation  <code>a: TheType</code> , then  <code>TheType</code>  is not a piece of text but a hypertext link to the type definition. These would be resolved at edit time. Same with method calls that can be resolved. Dynamic dispatch / abstract classes can be represented by a link to the base definition.</p>

Let's say that reality is like a state computation machine. How would it be possible to create a more accurate model of reality than we have currently? It would have to go beyond words, and would have to include visual, kinaesthetic constructs. It would have to be a higher dimensional representation, to the extent that we as humans can perceive a higher dimensional representation. So this means, higher than the 1D text we have, or its 2D UI, single frame in time representation. This would look like some kind of 4D temporal model, where it's possible to see the execution of a program in its entirety, all at once.</p>
<p>It would not only show semantic relationships in a graph sense, but also model the data structures and their operation over time. So the idea of "stocks" of data, and "flows" of data (from Donella Meadows, Systems Thinking) would apply here. React.useState might be represented as a small orb of energy, and if we setState, then it would visually change. When we assign const a = b, then it would visually indicate a flow of information from b -&gt; a. I think this would be a much clearer representation of what a program is doing, and free up cognitive load to focus on more important tasks, as opposed to the programmer having to hold a mental model in their head. No matter how good a programmer is, if he or she possesses a better more accurate kinesthetic model of what is happening, their brain power is freed up to solve more problematic and relevant abstractions.</p>
<p>I've been mocking up a prototype of how this would work, and the basic idea is overlaying a tool like VSCode with "vibes" as well as flow relations. It's like an annotation layer over existing code, but this is just the basic start of how it would look like. Ultimately, it would look like a mini universe.</p>

<p>let's say your venue has some stairs at the front door, and people in wheelchairs struggle to enter it, there are various things you can do:</p>
<ul><li>carry the person up the stairs.</li><li>add a ramp (in addition to the stairs).</li><li>replace the ramp with some stairs (and never build stairs again).</li></ul><p>This is a common example that gets taught in teacher training for how to think about accessibility in the classroom (context: i used to work in Special Educational Needs).</p>
<p>the best option in this metaphor is to  <em>start</em>  by building a ramp, then everyone can enter together, and you don't have to do any extra work, and everyone can be independent.</p>
<p>I've been using this metaphor recently in tech accessibility, because the proposed solution is often something like:</p>
<ul><li>build an AI assisted Iron Man megasuit that lets the person fly</li></ul><p>in this case, thats what it seems like to me. I guess there's a common mentality that technology will be the  <em><em>only</em></em>  __ answer to all our problems. I quote: "Supporting Disabled Users  <em>Requires</em>  Generative UI".</p>
<p>i think that we need ramps, not iron man suits, which requires societal change, not technological change</p>

<p>Related: the UI will be impossible to document, and almost impossible to help anyone with. People can't necessarily share their knowledge about it between them. Even official support will probably involve screensharing at best; I have no idea how that works for people with disabilities. Good luck writing support scripts (actually we can take that one as a silver lining, but companies won't like it).</p>

Still. What proportion of the web is built that way? When I estimate the proportion I think we could achieve, the analogy that comes to mind is more elevators than ramps.

<p>You literally cannot persuade the German people to write in plain language with a coherent document structure. It's not a realistic proposal; yes it is too hard.

<blockquote><p>For computing to work for everyone, it must be accessible to everyone. Alas, it is not: people with disabilities in mobility, vision, hearing, learning, attention, and more regularly face software that is hard or impossible for them to use. One reason for this is that when we educate future software engineers, we rarely teach them anything about accessibility. This limits their ability to find and fix accessibility defects and advocate to their organization to prioritize those fixes. More importantly, it limits the capacity of software organizations to design software that is accessible from day one.</p>

<p>Labanotation (grammatically correct form "Labannotation" or "Laban notation" is uncommon) is a system for analyzing and recording human movement (notation system), invented by Austro-Hungarian choreographer and dancer Rudolf von Laban (1879-1958, a central figure in European modern dance), who developed his notation on movements in the 1920s.</p>

From my paper with Kate:</p>
<p>"Reviewing related historical and contemporary approaches to movement notation allowed us to reflect upon and bring together the different histories of code and choreography. A key reference point in the representation and notation of human exertion as  <em>effort</em>  can be found in  <em>Effort: Economy in Body Movement</em>  written by choreographer Rudolf Laban in collaboration with management consultant F.C. Lawrence in 1947. The book proposes a systematic, seemingly elegant way to categorize human efforts in movement, through a combination of elements such as time, weight, and space.  <em>Effort</em>  is as applicable to industrial time-and-motion studies as it is to dance choreography. We should also note that Laban‚Äôs earlier work was as choreographer for Hitler and Goebbels, until his work on the 1936 Olympic games was rejected (the Nazis rejecting Laban, rather than vice versa). While this theory arose from white supremacy and Fordism, it continues to be influential in choreographic research and practice."</p>

<blockquote><p>All of the "fake software" we have today is not like this, and does not allow this. Instead, it consists of a number of "locks" through which water only flows in one direction - conducting power out from the worlds of developers into the worlds of users, and accepting no inflow in the other direction. This is precisely what APIs and abstraction boundaries, compilers and modules are designed to achieve - to concentrate power in the hands of those who have it, and to ensure that none of it leaks outwards.</p>

<div id="2024-03-18T20:16:09.247Z" class="post"><span class="user">Fredrik</span> <a href="./?fromDate=2024-03-15&amp;toDate=2024-03-21&amp;channel=thinking-together&amp;filter=#2024-03-18T20:16:09.247Z" class="date">2024-03-18 20:16:09</a> <div class="message"><p>Is there any wisdom on  <em>how to best lay out code in a visual code browser</em> ?</p>
<p>In my experience, code can be layed out either more horizontally on long lines or more vertically on short lines. This is controlled by setting a criterion for how many levels of nesting there can be before a node switches to a multiline layout. Long lines use space efficiently but tend to get hard to read. Short lines are easier to read, as tokens of similar significance line up in columns, but tend to take up much vertical space while leaving most of the horizontal space unused, as the average line is just one key and one value.</p>
<p>Shall I accept that code gets very vertical, and use the free horizontal space to add multilevel navigation panels, or is there a third option that is more horizontal while still easy to read? I can go really fancy and add tables and multiple columns, since I have full control over the layout function, but not all code is regular enough to fit a tabular format, and I cannot require the person editing the code to manually bikeshed it by editing whitespace or dragging around visual nodes. I've seen the <a href="https://gitlab.com/procps-ng/procps/-/blob/master/src/top/top.c">horrors of manually bikeshedded plain-text languages</a> and the horrors of node-based languages where the programmer makes a simple one node change and then has to drag all the nodes around so they line up. Are there any examples of interesting solutions to look at?</p>
<p>Here's how I mean a more horizontal layout:</p>
<blockquote><p> <em>element 1</em> 
 { 
 <em>key 1</em> 
: value 1, 
 <em>key 2</em> 
: value 2, 
 <em>key 3</em> 
: 
 <em>surprise</em> 
 { 
 <em>key 1</em> 
: value 1 } }</p>
<p> <em>element 2</em> 
 { 
 <em>key 1</em> 
: value 1 }</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's how I mean a more vertical layout:</p>
<blockquote><p> <em>element 1</em> 
 {</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>&gt;  <em>key 1</em> 
&gt; : value 1,</p>
<blockquote><p> <em>key 2</em> 
: value 2,</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>&gt;  <em>key 3</em> 
&gt; : 
&gt;  <em>surprise</em> 
&gt;  {</p>
<blockquote><p> <em>key 1</em> 
: value 1,</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>},</code></pre><p>}</p>
<blockquote><p> <em>element 2</em> 
 {</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>&gt;  <em>key 1</em> 
&gt; : value 1,</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>In the more horizontal layout, I can barely parse the surprise structure at a glance, and I can barely see if I've made a mistake in editing. It takes a lot less screen space though.</p>

In my real app, you get a different reading. I've found it helpful to test my apps with a screen reader, and I've decided to design separately for visual presentation and screen readers, so there's no need to adjust the visual presentation to work with screen readers. Screen readers get the full hierarchy of all nodes, and the user can use the arrow keys to navigate individual nodes. Each node reads a summary, and the user can navigate into it to read more about the child nodes.</p>

Both make the point that text is scanned / reread repeatedly. Because it isn‚Äôt necessarily read linearly, having ‚Äúlandmarks‚Äù that gives your eyes something to hook onto and make related structures chunkable as shapes is valuable. These marks are provided by the indentation. Apart from the words, both of these books practice what they preach when it comes to creative and memorable text layouts.</p>
<ul><li>what we see when we read by Peter mendelsund</li><li>Seeing with fresh eyes by Edward Tufte</li></ul><p>In visual neuroscience they benchmarked the page width at which reading speed / comprehension drops off a cliff aside from the basic physical constraint of reducing the amount of eye or neck movement to follow along.</p>
<p>The specific count varies by language / what comprehension means for your context, but it helps provide empirical backing for the intuition for why there‚Äôs a sweet spot in between being vertical vs horizontal heavy.</p>
<p>Your code / json data editor sounds neat. I get your concern about the risk of an author getting caught up in formatting bikesheds. One middle ground that comes to mind looking at your examples is letting the code be autoformatted however, but if I add a comment annotation before a section, in ‚Äúview mode‚Äù for the next section, that section could be forced into a vertical or horizontal mode, whatever I the author recommended.</p>

This is an idea I have already largely rejected. I don't trust myself to manually format my own code. I have way too much cognitive bias for that, so my formatting choices tell only how I was feeling the day the code was formatted, and what code I was reading earlier that day.</p>
<p>This problem occurs to me with argument lists of function definitions in Rust. Traditionally, argument lists are formatted horizontally, but sometimes they get long, or one argument may have a long name or long type, and then I format them vertically. Then I go edit another function which doesn't have a long argument list, and I format that vertically too, because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect">halo effect</a>. Rust has a tool called  <em>rustfmt</em>  that does exactly this middleground, automatic formatting with manual overriding in places, and I've not found it helpful.</p>
<p>Manual formatting also assumes that everyone views the code the same way as the person who formatted it. That's why we have silly commandments that the tab size must be set to a certain number of columns, or a page must be viewed in IE 5.5 with a screen resolution of 1024√ó768 pixels, or perhaps worst of all, assuming that everyone will view the code with a monospace font. (I don't, and even the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uknEhXyZgsg">Smalltalk browser from the 1970s</a> didn't.)</p>
<p>Thanks for the book recommendations! I will need to take more time to look at them. I love a good book about typography.</p>

<p>There's also a sort of middle ground, where the user chooses between vertical and horizontal formatters per syntax tree node, with a UI (and state management) akin to code folding.

<p>For top level navigation, there is a series of menus where the user selects a module, a class and then a method, similar to the Smalltalk browser. That replaces  <em>macro-folding</em> . Once the user has selected a method, there is no more navigation, as the user likely wants to read the full source code of the selected method.

<p>One idea I‚Äôll offer is that the annotation is something the reader could offer bring to the table in their viewer. This is similar to how you can opt to fold/expand sections in VSCode for either bracketed code, or sections in markdown. A set of annotations is a filter, with unique filters for each situations.

The idea is cells don't just store values, but more broadly they store information about what the value could be (such as a set of potential values), and propagators are like functions that react to changes in any number of connected cells, do computation, and then updated dependent cells continuously by* 'merging' in information (like finding the intersection of a set to get closer to a solution). It's a bit abstract, but these networks can be used as general purpose constraint solvers/computers by reacting to changes to cells and propagating updates to converge on a solution/steady state (they can be structured so they always converge). Bonus is nodes are 'actors' in the sense they are autonomous, async, and thus can be  distributed/run in paralle. Sussman and Radul have a paper in it- this is the best intro ive seen (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB5TrK7A4pI">youtube.com/watch?v=HB5TrK7A4pI</a>), and there are some implementations of it in <a href="https://github.com/ekmett/propagators">Haskel</a> for example  by this guy</p>

I'm so glad to hear the Propagator Model mentioned.  One thing I've learned in spending... oh my... a decade plus on the topic is that you must integrate invalid states and a view model from the start.  Then soon enough, you'll really want versioning.</p>
<p>Consider the simplest thing in a spreadsheet:</p>
<ul><li>Set  <code>A1 = 24.0</code> .</li><li>Set  <code>A2 = A1 * 9 / 5 + 32</code> .</li><li>Come back to edit A1.  Type "x".  What should happen to A2?  For a usual spreadsheet, the answer is nothing.  When active, a cell's state shouldn't propagate, so make that part of the model in the first place.</li><li>Hit enter.  We expect A2 to go funny in some way, ideally a way that points back to A1 as the source of the type error.  An advantage of something like the propagator model is that you can wire your network as the basic level and then independently experiment with the semantics of error propagation.</li></ul><p>What about versioning?  Versioning is useful for collaboration, yes.  And undo is essential for any non-trivial model that you can mess up.  But a real potential is realized in having the system make a bunch of version of things and then combine them.  For instance, make a bunch of copies of A1 and A2.  Vary A1 and chart how it affects A2.  So instead of having separate looping constructs, just allow for clones/copies of the parts of the model.</p>
<p>And if you make time first-class, instead of distinguishing between a clone and a copy, you can choose to either modify the original before or after copies were made to get a similar effect.  An advantage is that you now have a well-defined semantics for conflicts when an embellishment of a clone is incompatible with a change to the original.  You can pinpoint: this operation no longer works.</p>

<p>It has to do with what the goal for the sheet is. I've said this to you a few years ago. If you think the goal is to showcase the best work in the vein of this forum, Dynamicland and Dynabook make it in first.</p>
<p>But if the goal is to foster collaboration, they're dead weight.</p>

I'm also sympathetic to the idea that open source techbro culture isn't a panacea, and their pre-pandemic focus on in-person collaboration and continued focus on long-haul in-the-community nonprofit development is really interesting.. plus their new website will share a  <em>lot.</em> </p>

Open Source was a first step out of the industrial-capitalist mindset. We need to take more steps.</p>
<p>For the project list, that means thinking harder about what should and what should not be in it. Only projects from people active in our community? Only Open Source projects? I'd tone down the latter to "only projects that we can learn from", which requires less openness than Open Source.</p>

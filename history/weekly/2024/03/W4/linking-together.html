<p>In the other corner, some judgy comments about <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/clout-world">AI‚Äôs Looming Reputation Crisis</a> (scroll down to the middle to find that bit).</p>
<p>I read both this morning and I know these are different use cases, however they beautifully cover the whole optimism/pessimism spectrum on AI.</p>
<p>Where do people here fall on that spectrum? Are there use cases that are obviously good/bad, or does that depend on‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ what? And are we going to outsource most of our lives soon to AI assistants while simultaneously drowning in mediocre generated bullsh*t trying to scam us?</p>
<p>Gosh, I miss the time of the early internet when I was excited about everything tech. Somehow I can‚Äôt find back into that mindset these days. Can someone convince me that the future is going to be universally great, like it used to be 20 years ago?</p>

I've been very impressed with some specific applications, eg image and text generation, pattern recognition, etc.</p>
<p>In applications that need rigor, I'm very skeptical and actually think an ML based approach is completely backwards. Specifically for things like coding, engineering, maths and so on, a foundation of statistical correlation based on pre-existing text is... completely wrong (and why this is not blindingly obvious to everyone remains a mystery to me). You want to start with a semantic (not statistical) model. In any case I do find it easier to ask chatgpt about how to use an api for a specific purpose, and then validate that it actually works. People say LLMs sometimes hallucinate but in reality they  <em>only</em>  hallucinate: is just so happens the hallucination sometimes matches reality.</p>
<p>Side notes:</p>
<p>I really don't like that the model makers dont reveal their training data.  <em>Release your training data you cowards!</em> </p>
<p>AI/ML in decision making may help humans shrug away responsibility, which is also a major concern and I think we should stop talking about it as a magical entity that's different from a typical program. I think 'automation' is a great word, suggested by Emily Bender in this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK0md9tQ1KY">youtube.com/watch?v=eK0md9tQ1KY</a></p>

<p>Well the same can be said of the human mind: the abstraction of our senses to our conscious experience is a hallucination that is tightly constrained by incoming sense input. When we dream (or, well, when we hallucinate), those constraints are absent.</p>

<p>Our mission at&nbsp;Informal Systems&nbsp;is not just about distributed systems, it&amp;amp;#39;s also about the organizations that grow along with them. Our vision is an open-source ecosystem of cooperatively owned and governed distributed organizations running on reliable distributed systems. To achieve this vision, we begin with ourselves, adopting a democratic structure that aims to rebalance the power dynamics between capital and labour towards something more sustainable and non-extractive; something that nurtures long term employment and real wealth creation through R&amp;amp;D, entrepreneurship, and innovation; something more like a&nbsp;Zebra&nbsp;than a Unicorn.</p>

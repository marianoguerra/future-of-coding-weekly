<blockquote><p>What I’ve concluded, based on experience, is that positioning your project as an alternative implementation of something is a losing proposition. It doesn’t matter how smart you are. It doesn’t matter how hard you work. The problem is, when you build an alternative implementation, you’ve made yourself subject to the whims of the canonical implementation. They have control over the direction of the project, and all you can do is try to keep up.</p>

<blockquote><p>We are humans and might as well get used to it. So far, remotely done power and glory—as via government, big business, formal education, church—has succeeded to the point where gross profits obscure actual loss. In response to this dilemma and to these losses a realm of intimate, community power is developing—power of communities to conduct their own education, find their own inspiration, shape their own environment, and share their knowledge with others. Practices that aid this process are sought and promoted by the DAMAGED EARTH CATALOG.</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="https://higherorderco.com/">Bend: a parallel language</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With 
&gt;  <em>Bend</em> 
&gt;  you can write parallel code for multi-core CPUs/GPUs without being a C/CUDA expert with 10 years of experience. It feels just like Python!</p>
<p>No need to deal with the complexity of concurrent programming: locks, mutexes, atomics... 
&gt;  <em>any</em> 
&gt;  work that can be done in parallel 
&gt;  <em>will</em> 
&gt; be done in parallel.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/VictorTaelin/status/1791213162525524076">Twitter announcement (includes a short video demo)</a></p>
<blockquote><p>After almost 10 years of hard work, tireless research, and a dive deep into the kernels of computer science, I finally realized a dream: running a high-level language on GPUs. And I'm giving it to the world! Bend compiles modern programming features, including: </p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li><p>Lambdas with full closure support</p>
</li><li><p>Unrestricted recursion and loops</p>
</li><li><p>Fast object allocations of all kinds</p>
</li><li><p>Folds, ADTs, continuations and much more</p>
</li></ul><p>To HVM2, a new runtime capable of spreading that workload across 1000's of cores, in a thread-safe, low-overhead fashion. As a result, we finally have a true high-level language that runs natively on GPUs!</p>

<p>I really like the idea behind their system, I’d love to learn more about their GPU runtime in particular though. In my experience I was very grateful for C &amp; CUDA, do others agree? Though at times I felt that even they were too high level.</p>

That sounds like a very useful metaphor to me. Many of us are interested in or even working on visual coding tools, and I wonder what their take on this metaphor is. Maps are inherently visual, but they are not the territory, i.e. the code with all the details. To me, visual tools are obviously the right choice for creating maps, but I remain unconvinced about their appropriateness for code.</p>
<p>I am thinking in particular of <a href="https://twitter.com/OrionReedOne">Orion Reed</a>’s recent demo of infinite canvasses as user interfaces. For making multi-faceted maps to software systems, that looks like a very appopriate representation.</p>

Brooks in <a href="https://worrydream.com/refs/Brooks_1986_-_No_Silver_Bullet.pdf">No Silver Bullet</a> seems to have a perspective on that:</p>
<blockquote><p> <em>The reality of software is not inherently embedded in space. Hence</em> 
 <em><em>it has no ready geometric representation in the way that land has maps, silicon chips have diagrams, computers have connectivity schematics</em></em> 
 <em>. As soon as we attempt to diagram software structure, we find it to constitute</em> 
 <em><em>not one, but several, general directed graphs, superimposed one upon another</em></em> 
 <em>. The several graphs may represent the flow of control, the flow of data, patterns of dependency, time sequence, name-space relationships. These are usually not even planar, much less hierarchical. Indeed, one of the ways of establishing conceptual control over such structure is to enforce link cutting until one or more of the graphs becomes hierarchical.</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://nature-of-order.stefan-lesser.com/geometry-in-software">I’ve been struggling with this before</a>, and still haven’t found the time to put what I said <a href="https://youtu.be/qGDrrxuR584">here</a> into a more concise and readable format, but the gist is: Maps are powerful because they help us navigate… ha… I guess I should just end the sentence here… but I wanted to say… navigate multiple dimensions at once. Wardley defines maps as visualizations where position and direction have meaning, so these encode additional information in a spatial way that we are very well adapted to intuitively understand. So not everything visual qualifies as maps in his (and my) view, especially the now ubiquitous infinite canvasses rarely encode meaning in position deliberately.</p>
<p>That power of such representations, however, can cause us to overlook that they all are just models of a reality that has more dimensions than included in the representations we are looking at. That’s why it’s easy for Brooks to just casually list a few different visualizations we can easily create for software which all highlight and leave out different aspects of the same thing. In conclusion, as long as we are not trying to look for the one ultimate representation but accept various different ones for what they do and don’t do, it’s a magnificent tool in our toolbox.</p>
<p>Brooks continues saying:</p>
<blockquote><p> <em>In spite of progress in restricting and simplifying the structures of software, they remain inherently unvisualizable, thus depriving the mind of some of its most powerful conceptual tools. This lack not only impedes the process of design within one mind, it severely hinders communication among minds.</em> </p>

<p>re #1: Dependently typed languages let you put a ton of information about a value into its type. For instance, in Idris you can have a type  <code>Vect n a</code>  meaning “a vector of n elements of type a”, and then you can write an “append” function with type  <code>Vect n a -&gt; Vect m a -&gt; Vect (n + m) a</code> . Using functions like this, you propagate information about the lengths of vectors as you perform computations on them.</p>
<p>re #2: Neat idea. This may be less ambitious than you’re thinking, but I can imagine an IDE feature saying “turn the inferred type of this value into an explicit type annotation”. That way, you can make types explicit before a refactor to make sure you’re not changing types as you refactor.</p>
<p>re all: Your interests here seem related to software verification and other “formal methods”. In case you haven’t seen that stuff, I’d suggest <a href="https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny">Dafny</a> as an accessible starting point. It lets you write functions accompanied by logical specifications the functions are supposed to satisfy, and then to guide the system to proving that the functions satisfy these specifications. (Most systems like this cannot be automated in the same way that type inference is automated, because once you want to prove general properties of programs like “functions f and g do the same thing”, you get into things that are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_undecidable_problems">not computable</a> in principle.)</p>

<blockquote><p>a type system that somehow captures all information possible about every value in a codebase</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First thought: "all possible information" about a value includes the value itself. And then you quickly get to dependent types, as <a href="https://twitter.com/qualmist">Joshua Horowitz</a> suggested.</p>
<p>A more difficult problem is exploiting all that information in a useful way, i.e. come up with useful inference rules. I doubt that a single set of rules, i.e. a single type system, can capture all useful inferences while remaining usable. Unfortunately, the dogma of "thou shalt not have any type system other than the one of your one and only programming language" is rarely challenged.</p>

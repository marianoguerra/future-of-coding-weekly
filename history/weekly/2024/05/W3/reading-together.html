I read it years ago when it was still one single book and only contained the first two volumes. While I don't think it has much relevance to the main topic of FoC I'd say it's a really good one for what it aims to do and I would definitely recommend it to undergraduate or even high school students (kids could get seriously advanced these days...) who are ambitious enough.</p>

<p>What new use-cases do you think are now possible with gpt-4o that werenâ€™t possible before (natively multimodal)?</p>
<p>What use-cases are now possible with way cheaper gpt-4-turbo? </p>
<p>What are you excited to try / build?</p>
<p>I will start: I want to try and build a better screen reader for visually impaired people. </p>

I'm hoping to use 4o or turbo to have a more structured step by step approach to code generation in domain specific visual languages.</p>

I don't know if it's a use case, but what I can see happening is that more and more people are going to start treating the AI as a 'friend'.  I think that is quite sad, and will further isolate people from real life conversations, but I can also see how it will fill a need in some folks;  especially once the iPhone integration happens.</p>

<div id="2024-05-20T16:05:49.765Z" class="post"><span class="user">Stefan Lesser</span> <a href="./?fromDate=2024-05-17&amp;toDate=2024-05-23&amp;channel=thinking-together&amp;filter=#2024-05-20T16:05:49.765Z" class="date">2024-05-20 16:05:49</a> <div class="message"><p>This is one of those questions where I don‚Äôt really know yet how to ask it, so let me fumble and handwave a little bit and see where this goes:</p>
<p>In computing history we went from printers to screens, and on those screens from a brief stint with vector graphics to bitmap displays, and on those bitmap displays from text mode to frame buffer, and in those frame buffers from sprites and blitting to rasterization and compositing. In the early days, when there wasn‚Äôt enough RAM for a full-screen bitmap frame buffer, character glyphs and sprites were brought in from ROM. Now we have so much memory that we have double-/triple-buffering and realtime compositing of separately stored textures that often exceed the number of screen pixels available by an order of magnitude or more.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm particularly interested in the early transition to raster graphics. At some point (and I assume that was probably with PostScript?) it became feasible to compute graphics on the fly instead of having them prepared as bitmaps in ROM or on disk. If I remember this correctly, PostScript was invented because due to the different font sizes it was more economical to ship instructions to generate glyphs on the fly on the printer than to ship all possible glyphs as bitmaps in all the different font sizes.</p>
<p>In a way we went from a ‚Äúfinal‚Äù representation of a map of bits restricted to a certain grid size to an ‚Äúintermediate‚Äù representation of instructions that have to be executed to generate the final map of bits in the desired size. Alternatively, we could see that as swapping space (memory) for time (compute).</p>
<p>Are you aware of any papers or other material that compares both sides of this transition?</p>
<p>For instance in terms of performance in space and time, ie. how much compute is needed for how much memory saved. Or in the broader sense of how we settled on certain graphics primitives, because they were cheap enough to implement in terms of compute, and how we settled on certain data formats, because they were small enough in terms of memory usage, so that this trade-off made sense.</p>

<p>Back in those days I‚Äôm referring to, we were just figuring all that out. I‚Äôm looking for any kind of material that exposes the thinking processes that lead to the graphics stacks we use today, but also surface some of the abandoned (or never really investigated) ideas of what could‚Äôve been.</p>

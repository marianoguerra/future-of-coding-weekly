<p>It's only a slight exaggeration to say I want to ship the IDE to "end-users" (scare quotes because I believe the demographic shouldn't exist). The source code should always be available.</p>
<p>So it now seems to me that we've been nodding along to each other that bloat is bad, but our definitions of "bloat" are in opposition. From my perspective, opcodes and the transistors they run on are a necessary evil. Both are bloat without the source code and late binding needed to keep the human in the loop exercising agency over them. Anything else is just disempowering legalism (<a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/065">futureofcoding.org/episodes/065</a>) that is superfluous to requirements.</p>

If you look into it, it quickly becomes obvious that the machine code tends to be more bloated than the source code. That's on x86, an instruction set architecture that was designed to make the machine code as short as possible, at the expense of making the interpreter implemented in hardware more complex and less efficient. Modern alternatives to x86 care less about the compactness of the machine code.</p>
<p>It may actually be less bloated not to ship machine code, but instead ship an intermediate representation that can be JIT-compiled to machine code. Formats such as minified JS, Web Assembly and Dalvik bytecode are examples of more compact formats for shipping that in the end are passed to a JIT compiler that outputs less compact machine code.</p>
<p>Not only are instructions in intermediate representation shorter than in machine code, but intermediate representation can also take advantage of polymorphism, allowing polymorphic code to be shipped only once, whereas the final machine code may come in multiple monomorphic copies.</p>

It reminds me of  <em>affordance</em>  after Gibson:</p>
<blockquote><p> <em>An affordance cuts across the dichotomy of subjective-objective and helps us to understand its inadequacy. It is equally a fact of the environment and a fact of behavior. It is both physical and psychical, yet neither. An affordance points both ways, to the environment and to the observer.</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I wouldn’t necessarily say affordance is a better word for what you’re after; it just seems to be a useful concept to be familiar with to better understand what you describe.</p>
<p>You also point towards the relational character of it, which I find the most important and interesting aspect, and which is a big step outside of what we like to deal with as programmers. Because it introduces context-dependence and requires specific adaptation — which I’m sure you are very open towards, given your involvement with moldable development.</p>
<p>I wrote a lot lately about intelligibility (your comprehensibility) of systems in <a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/t/on-simplicity">a series about simplicity</a>, which seems extremely related to what you think about. I tried to break out of that one-dimensional simple-complex spectrum, which leads to minimalism or <a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/on-simplicity-6-reducing-complexity">reduction of complexity</a> as the only solutions to avoid it, by pulling it apart into <a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/on-simplicity-3-familiarity">two separate dimensions of mechanical and experiential complexity/simplicity</a>, with the former related to the structure of the thing you’re looking at and the latter related to your cognitive processing of that structure, which is for instance highly influenced by your familiarity with it. That’s actually what my essay for Onward! is about.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don’t have a better word for you, but if you want to discuss this further, I’m available.</p>

And you can specific where that communication occurs, especially whether it's apparent through a course of usage or whether it requires digging deeper into things like documentation for purely informative purposes.</p>

Gibson's affordances are definitely a concept I should refer to. There's a difference, however, which matters to me: my notion of comprehensibility includes not only "what can this tool do for me" but also "does this tool do anything behind my back that I am not aware of".  Spyware would be the obvious case but I have also seen many well-meant small automatisations in computational science that turned out to be in contradiction to the expectations of some users.</p>
<p>The relationality of the concept is very much intended. It may well be interesting as well to judge the amount of information that a system makes accessible independently of what the observer can make of it, but for now I prefer to concentrate on the human-computer interaction aspect.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/stefanlesser">Stefan Lesser</a> I just re-read the essays you referred to. Good observations, there's definitely a "sweet spot" in complexity, rather than "the less the better". On the other hand, for the specific case of symbolic reasoning (mathematics, software), I can't come up with an example for "too boring because not complex enough". Elegance in mathematics has always been about minimalism, even though different people value different aspects of it differently (e.g. size of a symbolic expression vs. number/complexity of the definitions and theorems required to support it).</p>

<p>When I think of intuition in mathematics, I imagine things like understanding the term rewriting steps of the proof of say Pythagoras’ Theorem through symbol manipulation as an analytical/mechanical understanding. Whereas I’d say understanding a geometric proof of the same theorem is at least utilizing some of our intuitive/experiential understanding.</p>
<p>While I’m at it, let me add another example from another domain I know little about. 🙂 The way I understand moldable development I would assume that you relatively quickly notice that the same data structure with the same data in it in different visualizations has a vast range of how easy/difficult the data and its structure can be interpreted and understood. So in your words, if I understand correctly, some of those representations have a larger  <em>cognitive surface</em>  than others.</p>
<p>I just wonder, and would love to hear your thoughts on this: In mathematics, is it really the nature of mathematics, or more specifically the nature of formal systems and reasoning, that it is just about mechanical/analytical complexity, or have we just settled on a default representation that primarily  <em>affords</em>  mechanical/analytical reasoning and understanding? And as a consequence we (are led to) ignore (overlook?) intuitive aspects of it?</p>
<p>Asking for a tech philosopher who is worried that in software development we are doing exactly the same…</p>

<p>Easy one first: yes, I do believe that different visualizations of the same data structure have different cognitive surfaces, but this depends on the application context and not just on the data structure.</p>
<p>If you talk to professional mathematicians, they regularly point out the importance of intuition in their work. In particular the discovery of interesting relations is mostly a matter of intuition. Formal systems have two roles: (1) supporting intuition for filling in the details, and (2) constructing proofs. Proofs are extremely important because they allow to convert the intuition of individuals into collectively accepted knowledge. That's also why the mathematical literature heavily emphasizes formal approaches.</p>
<p>Computing has inherited this tradition, via Church, Turing, and others. It's not just a matter of symbolic representation affording this type of reasoning, I'd say it's baked even into our hardware. There are lots of different ways to process information. Biological organisms process information contextually, meaning informally. With AI we are making first steps into technological information processing that is contextual rather then formal. I guess we will see more of that. But I also believe that symbolic reasoning in the tradition of mathematics is here to stay. It's just too useful.</p>

Symbolic reasoning isn’t bad or wrong, it is obviously useful. It’s more like a “too much of a good thing…” situation, as we neglect other important things.</p>
<p>Polarization also comes primarily from analytic thinking: If there are two polar opposites, it must mean either or, as if we can pick only one. But (1) in complex systems polar opposites are just a model, an oversimplified approximation of what’s really going on, and (2) it’s about… well… some people would use the word balance, you used the term “sweet spot”, but that’s still too static. It’s a dynamic context-dependent balance that can be different based on context, so we need more than just intelligence to know what we’re talking about, but also the wisdom to decide how much of each is needed in which situation.</p>
<p>Context, however, is what we usually try to avoid; in science in favor of discovering context-independent  <em>universal</em>  rules, and in programming in favor of reuse and scale. I’m optimistic though, as it seems that we slowly wake up to the limitations of trying to brute-force everything with pure logical reasoning and as little context as we get away with. Maybe that’s just because I’m reading <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/author/alicia-juarrero-3467/">this</a> at the moment…</p>

<p>I’m aware of Illich, of course, but haven’t (yet) read  <em>Tools for Conviviality</em> . What I wrote about in that post is my synthesis of cognitive science research and it’s not the first time that common themes surface across relatively separate disciplines. It does look a lot like clever people in different domains keep discovering similar patterns. I ended up here ultimately through George Lakoff (linguistics) and Christopher Alexander (architecture/design theory).</p>
<p>What I began looking into ~5 years ago seemed to me like an earnest interdisciplinary effort between at least psychology, linguistics, anthropology, and philosophy. That’s how I found my way jumping between different disciplines. There were connections to computer science and AI research too, but I’ve been suspecting those disciplines are much more fragmented since you introduced me to the “ <em>epistemic opacity</em>  bubble”.</p>
<p>There’s some irony here, being a discipline that I like to accuse of having scaled complexity through hiding so far that nobody has a complete overview anymore — seems appropriate that the research in that domain is also more fragmented…</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m looking forward to reading your Onward! submission. I’d love to learn more about your different perspective and I can only think it’s wonderful that we come at it from such different origins.</p>

<p>At least that is how it feels to me most of the time. Maybe I haven’t been to the right cocktail party yet?</p>
<p>I have read Illich’s  <em>Tools for Conviviality</em>  now and I can see the parallels. He’s influenced by Erich Fromm and my argument is based on Fromm’s existential modes. Alexander must’ve also been influenced by Illich. I’m happy that my framework integrates well into the larger picture, but I do hope that my conclusions are already a little more specific today, and will be a lot more specific tomorrow. At least for people who wish to create better stuff in this world that is impacted by the issues Fromm, Illich, Alexander, and all the others describe.</p>
<p>Now, how do you see this kind of philosophical discourse; why did you write a paper about this? Is this just because you’re personally interested? Was this just a personal challenge? Do you think it will have some impact of some kind?</p>
<p>I’m still struggling with closing the loop from having a robust framework that integrates well with the ideas of bigger picture thinkers to getting software people excited about this. Ironically, I don’t think until we present utility and convenience/efficiencies that can be gained from such a different world view or approach to design, few will spend any brain cycles on this. Do you see the same issue, or do you have reason to be more optimistic?</p>

Such ideas floated around in the 1960s to 1980s (Iverson, Engelbart, Kay, ...) but were abandoned when software became an industry, with professional developers making products for end users, with epistemic opacity becoming a desirable feature. But the convivial power user systems of the past (Lisp, APL, Smalltalk) are still alive, which is why I am cautiously optimistic. They represent small niches, which makes it hard to evolve them to better meet today's needs.</p>
<p>The angle of attack I am pursuing personally is trying to convince my professional environment, computational science, that industrial software is by construction unsuitable for us. When talking to my colleagues about this, I see a lot of agreement in principle but hardly anyone who believes it can be done. I hope to be able to prove them wrong. Maybe this will not work out, but as long as I am having fun along the way, I don't care!</p>

<p>I evaluated the non-interpretable and inaccurate "chat your data" LLM solutions. I'm currently thinking about the possibilities of developing/using a DSL as intermediary output prior to code generation to make the process more interpretable. I am also considering what would be the most efficient abstraction strategies of the analytical functionalities/libraries in certain biological domains to improve the accuracy of the outputs (of the higher level strategy and the actual code). I would love to brainstorm about these problems offline/online.

I feel like I have something worth exploring, but to illustrate it I need a diagramming language that allows me to nest nodes inside of one another, and draw edges that originate and terminate at arbitrary depths of nodes. DOT won't let you draw an arrow starting at the edge of a subgraph, and doesn't have any way of nesting actual nodes, for example. Is anyone aware of a text-based graphing language that will let me nest objects and draw edges between arbitrary depths?</p>

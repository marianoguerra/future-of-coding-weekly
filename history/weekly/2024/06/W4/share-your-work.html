<p>I actually been thinking for a while, like bret's stuff is super interesting to me technically &amp; all that, but as an artist (musician) I don't find it very compelling.</p>
<p>Technology does certainly enable new forms of art - I happen to love looper pedals &amp; it transformed my life.. but I would have been fine w/o the looper, it's important to remember that pre-looper music is still very cool (to over exaggerate my point).</p>
<p>My point, is technology certainly can enable new art - fish with jet packs who devour entire planets, but it doesn't discard the old dead fish which are just as beautiful.</p>

Smith</a></p>
<p>If you're anything like me (oof, sorry), you've heard of <a href="https://worrydream.com/refs/Smith_DC_1975_-_Pygmalion.pdf">Pygmalion</a> but never caught more than the gist. Some sort of project from the early 70s, similar to Sketchpad or Smalltalk or something, yet another promising prototype from the early history of our field that failed to take the world by storm. Our stock-in-trade on this show.</p>
<p>But you've probably heard of Programming by Demonstration. And you've certainly heard of  <em>icons</em>  ‚Äî you know, those little pictures that have become indelibly part of computing as we know it. Pygmalion is the originator of these concepts‚Ä¶ and more!</p>
<p>The best introduction to Pygmalion is <a href="https://twitter.com/warianoguerra">Mariano Guerra</a>'s <a href="https://instadeq.com/blog/posts/no-code-history-pygmalion-1975/">No-code History: Pygmalion</a>, which includes a clearly articulated summary of the big ideas, motivation, and design, with a video demonstration of the programming interface, key terminology, and links.</p>
<p>The  <em>most</em>  introduction to Pygmalion ‚Äî or Pig Million, The Millionth Pig, as it'll surely come to be known ‚Äî is the subject of today's episode: the original paper by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Canfield_Smith">David Canfield Smith</a>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I feel like a relational system has a unique advantage here.</p>
<p>To me the basic problem is that objects can only have 1 classification (inheritance doesn't really help this).</p>
<p>So it might be useful to have a notion of a user, admin-user, student-user, ... I don't want to have a class called  <code>admin-student-user</code>  defined explicitly but.. that type of user might exist.</p>
<p>Instead I'd like to just have data globally available, &amp; classification functions/predicates, and operations check the predicates in a prolog-ish way.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>I also think css selector system is another interesting way to tackle the problem of hyper specialized functionality for complex data.</p>

<blockquote><p>‚ÄúI see OO everywhere‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OOP has some peculiar ways to ‚Äúhack‚Äù into our cognitive system. The way we categorize things when we talk (and think) about them, feels very much like modeling a domain with OOP. And we categorize things all the time.</p>
<p>When you casually bring up your neighbor‚Äôs dog in a conversation, you say ‚Äú ~<em><em>dog</em></em>~ ‚Äù. It would be weird to talk about your neighbor‚Äôs  ~<em><em>mammal</em></em>~ . And although possible, if you are super into dogs yourself, you would likely not talk about your neighbor‚Äôs  ~<em><em>cocker spaniel</em></em>~ . You pick  ~<em><em>dog</em></em>~  ‚Äî a natural category that‚Äôs not too generic and not too specific, it just feels right. That all happens subconsciously. You don‚Äôt really think about it.</p>
<p>When modeling a domain we do something very similar. Without much experience, it‚Äôs easy to fall into the trap to believe that good natural categories make good classes in OOP. But experienced programmers tend to pick up that modeling domains for programming seems to work better with superordinate categories that are more abstract.</p>
<p>Applied to the analogy, programming usually works better if you‚Äôd refer to your neighbor‚Äôs  ~<em><em>mammal</em></em>~ , or even better to your neighbor‚Äôs  ~<em><em>animal</em></em>~ , or even better to your neighbor‚Äôs  ~<em><em>living being</em></em>~ , as often as that‚Äôs sufficient. That‚Äôs how you can reap the benefits of polymorphism best later. You pick the most abstract type class or interface available that models the behavior you want. That, however, is usually much more abstract than what intuitively feels right and is therefore in conflict with your intuitive cognitive categorization. It also requires more abstract thinking when discussing the design with fellow programmers.</p>
<p>I think OOP became so popular because it hooks into our cognitive categorization facility so effectively. And it became misunderstood and used ‚Äúwrongly‚Äù because most programmers designed classes to feel like good natural categories that work well in conversation, but then cause problems later because they are too specific for getting the benefits of polymorphism. You can‚Äôt really blame them for that. It‚Äôs very natural to do exactly that. Literally ‚Äú ~<em><em>natural</em></em>~ ‚Äù.</p>
<p>Now,  ~<em><em>dog</em></em>~  is a category or class or type. There are many dogs. But when you tell a story about your neighbor‚Äôs dog, you use that category as a shorthand to refer to a very specific thing that is unique. Unless your neighbor has several dogs, there is only one instance (and if your neighbor has several dogs, you would‚Äôve qualified it more to refer to one of them). </p>
<p>It‚Äôs easy to mix up what we‚Äôre doing here: We use an abstract category (class) to refer to a specific thing (instance). Human language is super ambiguous, but we usually get the level of abstraction right so we can understand each other. And we don‚Äôt really think about that distinction between a category and a unique thing either. We (usually) tend to just know what we mean.</p>
<p>In programming we need to be more precise. The colloquial understanding of OOP is that behavior is modeled in classes (because we want to reuse it), while state is modeled in objects (because we need to distinguish different instances). The confusion with what Alan Kay really meant comes from that. Because in Smalltalk both behavior and state are modeled in objects, and it is kind of understandable why he called it ‚Äúobject-oriented‚Äù and why he dislikes classes. And message passing was so important because that was the universal interface for any kind of object to interact with any other kind of object. Message passing was the most abstract behavior that applied to all state ‚Äî maximally efficient polymorphism, if you will.</p>
<p>Class-focused OOP happens, pretty much  ~<em><em>naturally</em></em>~ , if we just apply our unreflected naive understanding of how we categorize things and model our domains like that.</p>
<p>I haven‚Äôt worked out if all that makes OOP a good or bad approach to modeling domains. It‚Äôs obviously beneficial to hook into stuff that comes easy to us, but then it seems as if in this case we get lead down the wrong path too easily and what we need for good design is somewhat opposed to what feels right intuitively. But then if you‚Äôre aware of that, you can make it work quite well. ü§î </p>

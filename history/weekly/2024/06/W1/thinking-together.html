So I can express the idea "Socrates believes that he is mortal" with  <code>bel ieves(socrates, mortal(socrates)).</code>  Are there any popular database types that make it easy to have relations of arbitrary arity as parameters of other relations, without unduly adding to the complexity of the schema? Preferably with ungrounded statements and open-world negation? Is there some obvious reason why not? Is there a computational complexity problem that arises in the real world? RDF allows triples to be referenced, I believe, but you are limited to arity 2, which seems needlessly limiting. Labeled graphs have arbitrary arity for non-entities, but entities are limited to two, and you usually can't refer to an edge. It seems... weird to me. Is it just that we don't really have the efficient reasoners over those kinds of expressions, so it hasn't been useful?</p>

</div> <div class="attachments"><blockquote><p>üìù <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12235">Hypergraph: A Unified and Uniform Definition with Application to Chemical Hypergraph</a></p>
<p>The conventional definition of hypergraph has two major issues: (1) there is not a standard definition of directed hypergraph and (2) there is not a formal definition of nested hypergraph. To resolve these issues, we propose a new definition of hypergraph that unifies the concepts of undirected, directed and nested hypergraphs, and that is uniform in using hyperedge as a single construct for representing high-order correlations among things, i.e., nodes and hyperedges. Specifically, we define a hyperedge to be a simple hyperedge, a nesting hyperedge, or a directed hyperedge. With this new definition, a hypergraph is nested if it has nesting hyperedge(s), and is directed if it has directed hyperedge(s). Otherwise, a hypergraph is a simple hypergraph. The uniformity and power of this new definition, with visualization, should facilitate the use of hypergraph for representing (hierarchical) high-order correlations in general and chemical systems in particular. Graph has been widely used as a mathematical structure for machine learning on molecular structures and 3D molecular geometries. However, graph has a major limitation: it can represent only pairwise correlations between nodes. Hypergraph extends graph with high-order correlations among nodes. This extension is significant or essential for machine learning on chemical systems. For molecules, this is significant as it allows the direct, explicit representation of multicenter bonds and molecular substructures. For chemical reactions, this is essential since most chemical reactions involve multiple participants. We propose the use of chemical hypergraph, a multilevel hypergraph with simple, nesting and directed hyperedges, as a single mathematical structure for representing chemical systems. We apply the new definition of hypergraph to chemical hypergraph and, as simplified versions, molecular hypergraph and chemical reaction hypergraph.</p>

So you‚Äôre used to thinking of a relational database as this heavyweight, fixed sort of thing with a terrible query language.</p>
<p>The correct way to understand the relational model is that it lets you separate your first order logic (FOL) computation from the stuff that should be (either logically or pragmatically) done in a Turing complete language.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the logic in just about any program can be written in FOL. Folks don‚Äôt even think about doing that because SQL is terrible.</p>
<p>One of the great features of the relational model is that precisely because of its limits, optimisation is a relatively simple problem. We should be able to use relations freely across all of our programming tasks. The result would be that you can just declaratively specify what comes from what, and the query optimiser will make it work efficiently.</p>
<p>These considerations still apply to SQL databases. If you execute a query, it will eventually finish and when it does, you‚Äôre guaranteed that if some data satisfies your query, it will be retrieved.</p>

You discovered the weakness in my cunning ruse!</p>
<p>Not really. You can certainly write SQL queries that will time out. But in practice, those are rare, and if you had to solve the same problem in a Turing-complete language, there‚Äôs a good chance you have no other way to fix it.</p>
<p>Computation complexity is always with us, either way.</p>
<p>And in practice, there might be some things that are easier to write in a TC language. But I‚Äôd have to struggle with some quite unusual sort of data for a while to produce an example.</p>
<p>So: a relational database can represent most of most programs more cleanly and simply than any mainstream TC language can, and it does a lot of the programming for you, particularly in terms of working out what order it should process each part of your logic in. And, because it can do that dynamically and automatically, it can retain efficiencies even as you change the model, whereas the typical TC solution might need substantial re-engineering to retain efficiency.</p>

Prolog is one such, is very useful for some types of problems, and is I believe easier for non-developers to learn than most TC languages. Mercury is another such, not so beginner friendly but very expressive and flexible.</p>

Predicates for filters, for example, are not part of the relational theory but are just supplied from a TC language.</p>
<p>So your idea for a language that contains both but separates them is not terrible. Although even with SQL, you can see the advantage of separating the relational side. One of the most underappreciated advantage of a separate relational storage engine is that you can use the same data store from multiple programs, written in different languages.</p>

As a result of that fact, the user can alter the data arbitrarily, and there is no possibility that by doing so they cause queries to become non-terminating. That's the actual upside. The user can't break it. If you are using a higher-order system, you have to either a) be careful not to use potentially infinite structures in your queries (in which case why not just use FPL), or b) guard against the user adding data that causes infinite loops. For my use case, b) was already taken care of in the context of the limited queries I have. Thanks for the enlightening chat!</p>

<ul><li>Is there any good research about using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_graph">call graphs</a> to create some metrics about the quality of a software architecture?

It went roughly like that: (starting assumption) When you do an incremental change in a system, in a well-organized system you would only have to change the source of one function - the function responsible for the thing you want to change. Also many different changes shouldn't all concentrate on the same function because it hurts code reuse. This sounds pretty ambitious and doesn't really hold in any real system BUT it can be used as a proxy to find problematic areas. Take a look at a git log. If there are groups of functions that are usually changed together (in the same commit) - then it means that they share something that could be extracted into a common location. Also any place which is a hotspot of changes (almost every commit touches it) then it probably could be split out. All of this can be formalized as counting bigrams of functions changed in the same commit. I've done some stats like that on a large-ish project at work and the hotspots (functions which were changed in commits) followed something similar to the zipf distribution. It didn't made sense to split everything but it showed some very interesting correlations that nobody had idea about (even the people working on the system).</p>

<p>I take the stance that using a function-based paradigm is  <em>only one</em>  possible way to program.</p>
<p>From this vantage point, programming of Reprogrammable Electronic Machines (mis-named "compute-ers")  in 2024 presents a cornucopia of futuristic possibilities, much like in the 1950s when (the royal) "we" had to figure out how to deal with the problem space of programming CPUs. We need, yet, to satisfactorily solve the transition from CPUs (Central Processing Units) to DPUs (Distributed Processing Units) and to address the problem space of true asynchronicity for problems like robotics, internet, gaming, etc, etc. I acquired a one-chip Arduino that was on sale for $5 and  <em>could</em>  have built myself a better-than-connection-machine with 1,000s of such devices, yet, I, also, knew that the current crop of programming languages couldn't be used to handle such a task. To me, it currently feels just like it did in the early 1970s when I rolled my own Lisp, wire-wrapped my own CPU, hollowed out a Radio Shack calculator to scrounge it's meagre display and keypad, and, finger-poked into an IBM Selectric typewriter to write an article for DDJ.</p>
<p>I vote that the next time you suffer from insomnia, please, also, bless us with a thread about Chuck Moore's Green Arrays, or Dave Ackley's stuff, or Sassenrath's Rebol, or Pong, or the Yamaha WX7, or the Apple Newton, or ...</p>

The whole game was expressed on one piece of paper and could be understood and afforded and built by a poor student. I haven't seen any programming language today that competes with that kind of succincticity. My gut says that the Pong schematic is succinct because of fundamental asynchronicity, unlike modern programming languages which are all the same - synchronous at the core. (Aside: Q: why am I interested in 0D, and, true message-passing???).  My gut says that we've gone sideways, but, not forward. The WX7 (wind controller - looked like a clarinet) was just outside-of-the-box strange use of hardware. You could control a synth by blowing into the WX7. Probably programmed in assembler. Even my Apple Watch 9 doesn't do anything when I blow on it (I think üôÇ). The Newton did stylus-based hand-writing recognition - only in B&amp;W - decades ago, before Jobs pulled the plug (and put the downtown Newton Store out of business). The Palm Pilot was still a going concern at the time. This was decades before the emergence of so-called "smart" phones.</p>

[Are you aware of Buxton? If not, you might wish to become aware]. Later at the reception, we discussed theremins and he mentioned the idea of hooking a theremin into a Pitchrider [my '59 Strat still has stains on the pickguard where I'd attached a Pitchrider pickup (I was able to play blues harp with my guitar (a good use for what is now called auto-tune))].</p>

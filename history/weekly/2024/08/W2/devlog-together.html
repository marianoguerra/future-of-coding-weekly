Fluid layout, one breakpoint that moves elements around for smaller screens, light and dark modes, nice keyboard nav, etc etc. Thoroughly documented too, since I figure some folks might want to peek at the css but aren't up on all the new weird stuff you can do.</p>
<p>Also, I'll be eating my hat now: everyone who scolded me for attempting to parse a markdown-like syntax with Regex, well, yeah, it kinda stinks. Not sure what to do about this, given the values I'd like to impart in this project. Since it's not a blocker on writing pages, I think I'll ship it half-finished and we can talk about it. This feels like a great area to draw on the wisdom of the crowd.</p>
<p>Markdown or not, we'll still need a build script, I reckon, unless we want to  ~<em><em>require</em></em>~  that anyone adding a new page also add their page to any relevant indexes — since, I reckon, we'll need some indexes just to get through the early phase where the wiki will be sparsely interconnected. To start, I'm thinking one index of broad categories (or maybe tags, dunno), and then another that's just a list of all pages. But if anyone has strong feelings about the right way to do this, I'm at least 75% ears.</p>

<ul><li>Gemtext: doesn't ring a bell, so I'll definitely take a look at it. Thank you for the rec.</li><li>CSS: I'm using features like rule nesting and custom properties, which make it faster to iterate on the design. Once the dust has settled, I can spend a few cycles making sure everything degrades gracefully — this adds bulk and cyclomatic complexity, so it's actually against the spirit of simplicity and minimalism, but it's worth doing to give as many folks as possible a nice experience.</li><li>I'm going to say that a search engine that's somehow specific to this wiki is out of scope for now. We could add, say, a search box that just drops the user on duck duck go with a  <code>site:</code>  query, maybe. But especially when the quantity of text on the site is relatively small, search is going to be a bit shot-in-the-dark. Good to think about for down the road, sure.</li><li>Yeah! The thing I'm setting up is (A) a git repo with all the wiki entries as either html files or some sort of md-like plain text files, (B) a build script that generates nice static html pages based on the wiki entries, and (C) the means of serving those html pages with nice styling at some official URL. Anyone can clone the repo and do whatever else they want with it. I'd love to see people build alternative tooling around this corpus of wiki entries.</li></ul><p><a href="https://webcode.run">Tom Larkworthy</a></p>
<ul><li>I don't really want to couple anything to Google (or Amazon, etc). Everything that I've set up so far just assumes much more bog-standard / portable tech, like "a programming language with regexes" or "a web server that can serve html files". On the initial call where we hashed out this idea, one compelling thought was that by hosting the wiki git repo on GitHub, folks could use their web-based editor to write/edit wiki entries. So we are doing that, but that's just additive, not essential.</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2024-08-06T07:53:51.519Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Duncan Cragg</span> <a href="https://history.futureofcoding.org/?fromDate=2024-08-03&amp;toDate=2024-08-09&amp;channel=devlog-together&amp;filter=#2024-08-06T07:53:51.519Z" class="date">2024-08-06 07:53:51</a> <div class="message"><p>On "parsing markdown with regex", I'm sure most will know this famous StackOverflow reply:</p>

<p>It's simple, you just implement an FSM, and split the incoming character stream on any syntactically-relevant character, then backtrack if you hit a node in the FSM with no outbound edges.</p>

<p>Parsing is one of those funny things where the existence of lots of interesting theory and papers creates the impression that you need complicated tools, whereas in practice almost every industrial parser I've ever seen is just hand-written recursive descent because that is by far the easiest option.</p>

<ul><li>A major cause of difficulty in parsing is: ASCII. ASCII provides so few characters that we are inclined to overload their meaning. For example “begin string” and “end string” are both represented by the same quote characters in traditional programming languages. Parentheses can bracket expressions or invoke functions or define arg lists in function definitions. Unicode, though, has tons of characters, hence I, for one, have no compunction about choosing a single, non-overloaded meaning for specific characters, and, I have no compunction about choosing left and right bracketing characters for each different kind of bracketing that I feel is needed. The concept of nested comments seemed revolutionary in the past, but, would be natural using non-overloaded characters. Likewise, nested strings become easy to imagine. (Note that the Unix program “M4” does define different begin and end quote characters for some of its strings).</li><li>Recursive descent + backtracking = PEG. Recursive descent does better than CFG and REGEX for practical parsing, with the exception that you have to manually pre-refactor the grammar to fold together all common prefixes (left hand side of phrases). PEG adds the nuance that it can try to parse a phrase, and, if the attempt fails, PEG backs up and retries some other parse branch. With backtracking, manual common prefix refactoring is no longer necessary (the machine does it for you). Backtracking was well-known early on, but, frowned upon by those with 1950s biases. Early’s parser and PROLOG were side-stepped for “more efficient”, gotcha-full approaches. Backtracking ain’t all that hard if you ignore your inner 1950s biases. [I even have a JS backtracker (a Prolog) lying around, only lightly tested, on my repo somewhere, generated by my first use of OhmJS. I transpiled Nils Holm’s Scheme program to JS. If I can do it, anyone can.].</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2024-08-08T07:49:27.639Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Konrad Hinsen</span> <a href="https://history.futureofcoding.org/?fromDate=2024-08-05&amp;toDate=2024-08-11&amp;channel=devlog-together&amp;filter=#2024-08-08T07:49:27.639Z" class="date">2024-08-08 07:49:27</a> <div class="message"><p>I like the idea of building on gemtext.

Here's an idea for dealing with it: (1) Whoever proposes a modification to the notation has to supply working code that implements the change. We won't even discuss unimplemented ideas. (2) We'll set a limit to allowed code size. Something like "no more than 1.2 times the size of Ivan's first working version, for at least one year".</p>

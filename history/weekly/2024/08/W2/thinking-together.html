<p>First reaction: the title says "how" but not "what". I think the two go together by necessity. If you first decide, in the abstract,  <em>how</em>  you want to program, you end up constraining  <em>what</em>  you can program. Which is fine, of course, if you are aware of it and give priority to methodology. And I like reading about such approaches because my own is almost the opposite: start from  <em>what</em>  and then figuring out  <em>how</em> .</p>
<p>Another surprise for me is the focus on "a program", meaning a relatively autonomous unit of software. In the context of situated software, which I am also a big fan of, this looks like an unwelcome constraint. My own tendency at the moment is the opposite: build extensions/plugins to frameworks such as Glamorous Toolkit (or my own Common Lisp inspector framework) to profit from their affordances and keep the problem-specific code small. But then, this means accepting large dependencies. In terms of durability, a "program" is probably the better bet.</p>
<p>The nine-point synthesis is very interesting. Points 1-3 agree with my own experience. Also 5 and 6. Point 4 is one reason why I like building on a framework: it makes experimentation cheaper (see point 7!). At the cost of durability. Tough trade-off.</p>
<p>Point 9 reminds me of Gilbert Simondon's "The mode of existence of technical objects". He considers a technical object mature when it no longer resembles independent parts bolted together. A single design taking into account everything all at once.</p>

Also feel free to use this thread as a retrospective. We've had a few threads now where the format of comments was tightly circumscribed, and it's high time you had a place to comment on specific statements, ask for clarification, post clarification.</p>
<p>I'm going to be offline for the next week. But I'll read everything after I get back, post my own comments and questions (I have a few but won't lead off with my own) and then create some sort of digestible summary.</p>

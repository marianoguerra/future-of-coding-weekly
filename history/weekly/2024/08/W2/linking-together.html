<div id="2024-08-01T21:27:07.788Z" class="post"><span class="user">Kartik Agaram</span> <a href="https://history.futureofcoding.org/?fromDate=2024-07-29&amp;toDate=2024-08-04&amp;channel=thinking-together&amp;filter=#2024-08-01T21:27:07.788Z" class="date">üï∞Ô∏è 2024-08-01 21:27:07</a> <div class="message"><p>Prompt for everyone here: to the extent that you think about the Future of Coding or have projects to try to improve things,  <em>what problem are you trying to attack?</em>  Can you state it in a couple of sentences? Without reference to a solution? Try to be precise about the audience. For example, some problems affect everyone, while others affect only professional programmers, or only researchers who use computers in their work.</p>
<p>My hypothesis is that focusing on problems will help us all find our most promising collaborators in this group. (The next step will be to combat our tendency to be defined by our tools, to let our tools erect barriers that divide and balkanize us. But that's further down the road. For now, let's just "find our homies," the people we share specific dissatisfactions with.)</p>
<p>There are ideas for problem statements in a couple of earlier threads:</p>

Just add your own, and nothing else.</p>
<p>(It's totally fine to copy statements from these threads. Many of them were arrived at after tons of consideration so it would be surprising if others didn't care about them. Also feel free to synthesize from multiple statements. Just try to get to something crisp and opinionated.)</p>

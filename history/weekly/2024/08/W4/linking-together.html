<ul><li>All the models and (fake screens) etc. are now considered art, but they weren’t created as art. They were functional props on a movie/TV show set put together under tight timelines. How often do we put together functional code under tight deadlines? And how often is what we do regarded as art later? Almost never, I reckon.</li><li>His expertise: When he talks about smoked acrylic and how almost everybody doesn’t listen to him because “You’re losing light", even though he clearly knows exactly what he’s talking about, that reminds me of about a million conversations about how some clearly less experienced engineer tells an experienced veteran why their code isn’t good.</li><li>Oh, the pragmatism! The ship models? Hacked together from repurposing strange parts they had lying around. The details? Just enough to make it look great. The blinking buttons interface? Just a few lightbulbs behind the buttons that were supposed to blink. If that doesn’t remind you of software development, you’re not doing it right. Or you are, and that’s part of the problem. 😉</li><li>I know, there’s some physicality to all the examples in the video, but the LCARS interface points to the possibility of designing something in software only that can transcend its functional framing and become more than just a prop. We have a few examples of that in software (“You had me at scrolling”), but not nearly as much as we should have, I think.</li></ul><p>Where are the videos like this that celebrate achievements in software design?</p>

Thanks for sharing these notes - the crossover between interfaces and media is super fascinating. While it's a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy, we do get to see what Just Works through these speculative interfaces.</p>
<p>I remember my designers were strongly influenced by Star Trek graphical elements when they gave me a bunch of Figma boards on the week of the deliverable. I remember that the usability gains were not salient to me at that time. And also, being grateful that I didn't have to pen the CSS and the design at the same exact time.</p>

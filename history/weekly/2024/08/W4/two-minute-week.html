You can see a small video where I demo it here: <a href="https://youtu.be/xOKzC77NgRU">youtu.be/xOKzC77NgRU</a></p>
<p>The results are far from perfect and neither is the visual flow itself. Currently I only used a subset of mnist to train (9000 images) and on every training iteration the weights are updated per training image. Also the network can for sure be improvement by using a different layer setup and configuration parameters (different learning rate and activation / cost functions). From a visual programming perspective there are also lots of things to improve: currently a lot of the needed functionality is inside the nodes instead of being visible in the flow. So the neural and training nodes are black boxes as well as the node that loads the mnist dataset and handles some of the logic in the training proces. I want to change this in the near future though. You currently can't even see the resulting weights and biases.</p>
<p>Hopefully it is clear from the neural node types how the neural network is structured: it shows the number of nodes in the layer and an icon illustrating whether a node represents an input, hidden or output layer.</p>
<p>In the video I show a slow and fast run of the training proces: by putting the speed slider to the right you can run the flow without animations otherwise it takes too long.</p>
<p>There's also a custom node type that can be used to draw a digit manually and provide the digit which the drawing represents for purpose of calculating the error cost/loss.</p>
<p>Anyway, for now I am happy with the result. More to follow in the future :-)</p>

Because of the animation system it only appears that the nodes runs in parallel. The nodes are normal functions that can either run in sync or async when it returns a promise to the flow-engine. When the animation system is disables (by putting the speed slider in the top left at max) , the flow runs normally and nodes have to wait on each other. I probably could use a pool of web workers to improve this</p>

The input data is in most cases just a simple string but can be an object or array. And depending on the exact implementation of a node, the input data is passed through or not. In the passed I've build a different system which cloned the input payload to a node and a node could add or change data of that payload and it was passed on. But it was quite heavy on memory. That's why I am trying a different approach in this implementation</p>

In my scenario I used it when a node needs to do fetches for example (the node that initiates the training in the neural network example fetches the mnist dataset).</p>

They're drawn using fairly sophisticated procedures that were developed a copule of years ago for Google's Material Design system. Each object actually drops two different shadows - one coming from environmental light (a.k.a. ambient occlusion) and one from directional light (which is modelled as a disk with the same width as window and is positioned in 3d space roughly in front of the title bar). The cool thing about those shadows is that they're not using either shadow maps nor gaussian blurs (except concave shapes). The library takes some shape (vector contour of the object dropping shadow) + parameters of the light and computes a physically based analytical shadow mesh that is then drawn in the background. This manages to render fairly realistic shadows even while elevation of objects is being dynamically changed.</p>

<p>There is very little to read about it unfortunately and the official documentation is just dire. I've found about it at some Android Developer podcast some years ago (can't really tell which one unfortunately) where its author described it in more detail. I've had good experiences contacting the library authors through <a href="mailto:skia-discuss@google.com">skia-discuss@google.com</a> - if you're interested in digging deeper. Here is one code sample (should be editable): <a href="https://fiddle.skia.org/c/4fe859580ed911500608c35928d92d72">fiddle.skia.org/c/4fe859580ed911500608c35928d92d72</a></p>

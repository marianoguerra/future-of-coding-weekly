Without reference to a solution? Try to be precise about the audience. For example, some problems affect everyone, while others affect only professional programmers, or only researchers who use computers in their work.</p>
<p>My hypothesis is that focusing on problems will help us all find our most promising collaborators in this group. (The next step will be to combat our tendency to be defined by our tools, to let our tools erect barriers that divide and balkanize us. But that's further down the road. For now, let's just "find our homies," the people we share specific dissatisfactions with.)</p>
<p>There are ideas for problem statements in a couple of earlier threads:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://history.futureofcoding.org/?fromDate=2024-06-12&amp;toDate=2024-06-18&amp;channel=thinking-together&amp;filter=#2024-06-15T10:49:53.662Z">üí¨ #thinking-together@2024-06-15</a></li><li><a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1717926129937119">futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1717926129937119</a></li><li><a href="https://history.futureofcoding.org/?fromDate=2024-07-22&amp;toDate=2024-07-28&amp;channel=present-company&amp;filter=#2024-07-25T01:25:03.344Z">üí¨ #present-company@2024-07-25</a></li></ul><p>But this thread is not for critiquing or analyzing any of those statements. Just add your own, and nothing else.</p>
<p>(It's totally fine to copy statements from these threads. Many of them were arrived at after tons of consideration so it would be surprising if others didn't care about them. Also feel free to synthesize from multiple statements. Just try to get to something crisp and opinionated.)</p>

This mistaken assumption originated around 1954. Future of Coding projects implemented using computers, would progress much more quickly if we thought about CPUs as CPUs instead of as functions. I poke, randomly, at a variety of ways of thinking about programming and try to show that many ideas are 10x easier than can be imagined when using /only/ the function-based paradigm.For example, DPLs (Diagrammatic Programming Languages) and multi-tasking.</p>

<p>"General Purpose" programming languages are difficult to work with because they require you to work in abstractions far away from the problem domain. Domain specific languages can have first class visualization/structured editing of logic and data. This dramatically reduces the amount of things to keep in your head, and domain expertise (rather than coding skillz) becomes the primary prerequisite for proficiency.</p>

<p>Theory: Function-based thinking greatly restricts thinking about FoC.</p>
<p>Test: if this theory is true, then examination of the source code for The Mother Of All Demos will reveal that not all parts of the demo system were tightly inter-connected into a single synchronous, functional blob of design.</p>
<p>How?: Where can we find the source code for TMOAD? If we obtain the source, how can we reverse-engineer the design out from the implementation details? If we can get at the design, we should look for how the sub-units of software are interconnected. We need to examine if the code is designed as many islands of synchrony vs. being designed as just one big blob of synchrony.</p>
<p>Corollary: if TMOAD was designed as many islands of software and hardware, then it is unlikely that anything as interesting as TMOAD can come of building software on computers using only synchronous languages, like Python, Haskell, using concepts such as thread libraries, theorem-provers,  etc. [Thread libraries are but assembler-level work-arounds that enable the use of the function-based programming paradigm with languages like Python, Haskell, etc. Theorem provers need single islands of synchronous code, to work]</p>

I try to be careful to use the phrase ‚Äúfunction-based programming‚Äù instead of ‚Äúfunctional programming‚Äù. Function-based programming covers many more programming languages than functional-programming covers. I think of ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù to mean solderless - quick and easy - reconfiguration of reprogrammable machines. At that low level, functions are not inherently supported by hardware - you have to /add/ software and hardware to make ‚Äúprograms‚Äù work like ‚Äúfunctions‚Äù, i.e. you have to add lots of inefficiency to allow manipulation of reprogrammable hardware to make the hardware expressible as mathematical equations written on paper. I think that the paradigm of functions-grafted-onto-hardware is inappropriate for many modern problems, like internet, robotics, gaming, GUIs, etc. as witnessed by the invention of extreme gyrations and work-arounds such as thread libraries, promises, monads, etc. Early FORTRANs and BASICs did not express hardware manipulation as mathematical functions. Early Lisps showed that grafting functions onto hardware was viable and was a productive /paradigm/. Sector Lisp shows just how clean and small this can be when the paradigm is respected. Yet, early games showed that this kind of thinking was /not/ necessary. I feel that so-called ‚Äúcomputer science‚Äù ran with only the one paradigm - i.e. inefficient, function-based thinking mapped onto hardware manipulation - at the expense of cutting off many avenues of problem-solving. For the record, C and Pascal and Haskell and Python and JS and WASM and ..., are function-based, while PROLOG is not function-based, and, StateCharts are not function-based. I think that the function-based mentality deeply affects developers and, therefore, affects what developers can invent for non-programmers. I think that spreadsheets are just a stop-gap technology. Spreadsheets are ‚Äúthe best‚Äù that programmers can provide for non-programmers given developers‚Äô function-based mentality. Mathematical 2D notation is OK for use with papyrus and clay-tablet media, but, is not necessarily the most appropriate way to think about reprogrammable electronic machines in 2024. So, in my mind, we need to change the culture of /developers/ before even trying to imagine FoP (Future of Programming). I think that TMOAD (The Mother Of All Demos) was not bound by the function-based paradigm and that function-based programmers hold TMOAD in awe because it looks non-understandable - like magic - from a mono-paradigmatic perspective. I think that it would behoove modern programming researchers to delve deeply into TMOAD and to see how it differs from function-based thinking.</p>

<p>Jari and others, definitely share any resources you've been collecting as well. Or highlight any nuggets you particularly like in the archives. This feels like a topic worth a public list of curated bookmarks. Maybe somebody already knows of one?</p>

If you haven't added your reactions yet, please consider doing so! If you haven't written a problem statement yet, please do so before reacting to those of others. I know it's a non-trivial bit of work. I tend to open Slack on two windows somehow to jump between <a href="https://history.futureofcoding.org/?fromDate=2024-07-29&amp;toDate=2024-08-04&amp;channel=thinking-together&amp;filter=#2024-08-01T21:27:07.788Z">üí¨ #thinking-together@2024-08-01</a> and <a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1722660123009799">the problem reaction thread</a> ü§¶ But it does seem like something promising to think about.</p>
<p>I've also included a very rough, very preliminary, very incomplete stab at visualizing clusters of people's problem statements. There's no reason to think this "space" is Euclidean or 2D, so take it with a huge bucket of salt.</p>
<p>The visualization is in no way mapping status relationships. The intent is not to exclude anyone, but a very narrow instrumental purpose of finding opportunities to collaborate. If you need an analogy, a better one might be a star chart. It seems safe to assume we're all light years apart given our track record of collaborating üòÑ This picture is an initial attempt at making a map based on imprecise measurements from a single point. If you spend any time thinking about the map, try to build your own from the raw data to avoid my inevitable biases.</p>
<p>I started out with  <code>Kartik</code>  at the origin (no objectivity here!) and positioned first my 1s, then my 2s, then 3s and so on all the way to 6s. Then I tried to go through others similarly and resolve tensions in a very rough, very manual way. I might do this a few times to try to get better at it.</p>
<p>Even though this "data set" is almost certainly high-dimensional, a few 1-D relationships popped out at me:</p>
<ul><li><code>Kartik -&gt; Tom</code>  <ul><li><code>Tom -&gt; Paul</code>  =  <code>Kartik -&gt; Paul</code></li></ul></li><li><code>Kartik -&gt; Tom</code>  <ul><li><code>Tom -&gt; Nilesh</code>  =  <code>Kartik -&gt; Nilesh</code></li></ul></li></ul><p>I responded by putting the 4 of us on a straight line. There may be a spectrum here that bridges the incomprehension between the ends.</p>
<p>This sort of bridging of incomprehension is a common pattern. I initially had  <code>Ivan</code>  as far away from  <code>Kartik</code>  as  <code>Paul</code> . But several connections drew the  <code>Ivan</code> / <code>Eli</code>  cluster closer.  <code>Dany</code>  too might be as far from me as  <code>Paul</code> , but is just 1 away from  <code>Jimmy</code> .  <code>Guyren</code>  too, but is close to  <code>Tom</code>  and  <code>Dany</code> . So some of these edges have more "tension" than others, and I haven't come up with a way yet to show that.</p>
<p>(I'm currently showing edges labeled 1-3. If we get more data I might need to prune that further. The edges are directional but unfortunately <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~akkartik/snap.love">my tool</a> doesn't have arrows.)</p>
<p>Anyways. Add your problem statements and reactions!</p>

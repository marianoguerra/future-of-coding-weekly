Going back and rewriting an aspect of a working program just to improve one property of the  <em>code</em>  rather than the behavior: eliminating all derived data structures and re-deriving everything all the time in a performant way.</p>
<p>The result is a simpler API that seems applicable to pixel-based editors that use proportional fonts. Basically the problem is: as you do line-wrapping on a screen, how do you deal with interactive operations like clicking at a pixel coordinate or pressing the down arrow (which might result in a scroll). These primitives seem to make the implementation fairly self-evident: <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~akkartik/lines2.love/tree/main/item/move.lua#L11-28">git.sr.ht/~akkartik/lines2.love/tree/main/item/move.lua#L11-28</a></p>

<p>I built a propagation speed profiler in holograph to test how fast propagation was occurring for a little recursively incrementing loop (in the grey box). Im using a buffer to collect and average the values over time and another buffer to collect and display averages as a chart. You can see the propagation speed and compare it with the total Propagations Per Second (PPS in the top left). Before this work i was at a hard cap of 60 pps and now total pps often gets over 300. Still a long road ahead but it feels like a big win right now ðŸŽ‰</p>
<p>In any case, this example demonstrates major stuff added since my first post here:</p>
<ul><li>Get and set shape properties</li><li>Trigger click events</li><li>Dashed arrows that don't fire propagators</li><li>Async functions/fetch/await syntax</li><li>Lots of cool examples to explore- including some made my folk here :)</li></ul><p>Hope ya'll enjoyed the update! If ya'll find anything wonky or have ideas let me know !</p>

<p>Like, if you run this without rendering, does it get 100x faster?</p>

Rendering is batched and throttled to requestAnimationFrame and rendering together takes maybe 10% cpu (purple)? The main propagate function is maybe 50% (cyan). Maybe 20% idle (all propagation is async/settimeout rn so min 4ms delay there). Going to have to really optimize the propagate function to really push the limit which shouldnâ€™t be too bad since itâ€™s currently garbage. And reduce unnecessary propagation. And parallelizing/webworkers. And eventually Iâ€™ll probs want the main propagation logic in c/wasm. Just gonna be a slog haha</p>

Upon user actions, TL is handling diffing and firing a callback with changes which initiates update loop. Does that answer your question?</p>

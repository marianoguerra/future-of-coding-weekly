What we need is a separation of data and apps. If data is always examinable (an open binary format), you can have different apps accessing the same data, transforming it and pass to other apps. (Unix philosophy). This data can be live too and versioned. Apps would need to be stateless. Unfortunatly that goes against companies interests, so we can't have nice things.</p>
<p>Just look at places where we don't have silos. Like image manipulation, some 3d, email.. and of course text.. there we have a strong standardization of data formats.</p>

In Smalltalk, there is no data. There are only objects, and the only way to access objects is by "sending messages", which just means calling methods. Put differently: there's no data, only APIs. Data representation/format is alway an implementation detail.</p>
<p>This view has its good and bad sides, of course. The main disadvantage is the violation of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html">Rule of Least Power</a>, because the least-power-notation in this framing is a Turing-complete programming language. One consequence is that interoperability requires agreement on the programming language rather than just on a few data formats.</p>

There's a single memory space in which all objects live. No app boundaries. Tying things together into something new is straightforward. With modern UIs, such as <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">Glamorous Toolkit</a>, that's true even for GUI elements.</p>
<p>The problem is, of course, that all this harmonious co-existence works only for code written not only in Smalltalk, but in the same Smalltalk variant (there are many). It's the 1970s idea of a single ideal computing system that everyone will adopt because it's "best" that hasn't worked out. And once you need interoperability between systems designed with different priorities, you need weak coupling and the Rule of Least Power (which also has advantages inside something like a Smalltalk image, but that's a different story).</p>

<p>I replied to this point mentioning my unshakeable belief in what I am doing, and it occurred to me that there aren't actually many on this FoC Slack who can equally say that they know  <em>exactly</em>  what they are certain is right for the Future of (Programming)! We get a lot of speculative and experimental thoughts here which is the reason we all engage, but who amongst you can say you are 110% certain you've found what you believe to be the Future, with the uncertainty  <em>only</em>  being in "whenever that comes about"? Which  of course, as the Twitter thread mentions, is about the seemingly trivial but of course 110% important factor of "memeing" to the Internet. Personally, I'm crap at that bit.</p>

<p><a href="https://khinsen.net/">Konrad Hinsen</a> demonstrates it well. The people I know who are brilliant at what they do and have all the competency to be confident about, would never claim that they are certain about anything. And from my own experience I can only say that I’m beginning to understand how you get more and more uncertain, the deeper you dig and the more you realize how much more there is you don’t know enough about.</p>

I have no idea what you’re working on. Any of us could potentially make some commit to GitHub tomorrow and change the world. If you feel confident that you’re on a good path, then good for you. And I see no reason why you couldn’t have put all the effort in to have made it way past the slope of enlightenment. </p>
<p>Just thought it would be useful to be aware of this effect, not necessarily to place yourself on that diagram (which technically isn’t correctly representing the actual theory; that’s why I called it meme), but to realize how confidence may come across to other people familiar with it.</p>
<p>Could I have gotten this across in a better way? For sure. </p>
<p>I apologize for my tasteless attempt to make this point.</p>

Is the future of programming moldable? Yeah! Accessible? Yeah! More like gaming? Yeah! Etc. This community would be lesser if people didn't notice those big, attractive shapes on the horizon, row out for weeks or years to get a better look, and come back here to compare maps.

And I’d like to think that these statements are less about shapes of things to chase for and more about values people here already have and share. No future predictions needed.</p>
<p>You value moldable programming environments? Me too. You believe accessibility is important? Me too. You think games are getting some things right? Me too. We already share those beliefs. Here. Today.</p>
<p>Not everything has to be looked at as  ~<em><em>results</em></em>~  we want to achieve. Sometimes it’s good to share values and explore from there. Enjoying the  ~<em><em>process</em></em>~ . Together.</p>

I think in support of showing the thing, rather than making the user interact to see the thing.</p>
<p>Is there a soundbite for this? Are there any good links? I don't know where I encountered this opinion I  <em>think</em>  a few times, but I found something in one passage searching Bret Victors Explorable Explanations.</p>
<p>I wonder is this the most concrete link or reference I'll get, or does it ring a bell for someone else?</p>

<p>It’s like someone saying “look number 2 is so great, it’s the only even prime number, it’s so cool that it’s used as the base of digital systems, so we should use 2"</p>
<p>And someone else says: “well, number 3 is cool because it’s the first Mersenne prime, and it has a super cool divisibility rule, so we should use 3”.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, if the question is 1+1, then 2 is infinitly better than 3, and the other way around if the question is 4-1. And if you just need some positive integer as a placehold or something, then well, they are the same.</p>
<p>People seems to like and re-post these information a lot. I think these facts do provide some values, like the whole entertainment industry, it fulfills the curiosity of our minds and keeps us, well, entertained.</p>
<p>But drawing the conclusion that something is better, or something should be used instead of another thing based on these facts just feels off to me. It’s especially bad IMO, when people use these statements in PR reviews.</p>

It’s fascinating to me how most people in technology get away with arguing that whatever technical thing they like best and are most familiar with is objectively superior to everything else in all cases. They do, probably, because the “in all cases” is usually silent and most of us have a complicated relationship to anything context-dependent.</p>

I am at something of a crossroads in my career and privileged enough to be able to pursue almost anything. When I tell people the big problems I'd like to make an impact on, it's education, specifically science education. I want more people to understand how the scientific method works and how we use it to gain more understanding.</p>
<p>I have passively read about education (Montessori, Bruner, Piaget, Pappert), followed Alan Kay and the smalltalk story, and I was a math teacher for a couple of years. I also teach currently online.</p>
<p>I can't help but think that there is more to using computers than reproducing old media, and that the code-debug cycle is a good way to refine our understanding. And so maybe there is something there, using programming and interactivity as a medium for exploration of ideas.</p>
<p>However, I don't have much more of a vision than that. I was talking to my wife about it yesterday and came up with an interesting phrasing: I want to do what Montessori did with her learning materials but with computers as a medium. </p>
<p>I would appreciate any and all links to people, conferences, reading material, etc., that are related to this idea.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, I don't mean teaching kids to code. And I don't mean using software to support the current educational paradigm (e.g., Chromebooks in schools, etc.). People seem to automatically roll back to those two pits.</p>

<p>I wonder if the problem with VPLs is the word “language”.</p>
<p>It appears to me that the word “programming” has been generally accepted to mean “sequential language” or writing sequential codes (aka “coding”). I view this view as being too restrictive. Programming is more than just commanding a machine with sequentialistic instructions. Programming a  <em>CPU</em> , though, is - by definition - sequentialistic. But,,, programming a  <em>machine(s)</em>  need not be sequentialistic. Especially in the age of nothing-is-central. In fact, LLMs are an example of non-sequentialism. The machines that run LLMs were programmed, arduously, in sequential notation, but, the inner success of LLMs is not sequential, but something else (massively parallel plinko?).</p>
<p>VPLs and DPLs are, to me, not sequentialistic things. Maybe they should be called “notations” instead of “languages”? VNP and DNP? Visual Notation for Programming, Diagrammatic Notation for Programming? [In which case, “programming languages” as we know them, are TNPs - Textual Notations for Programming].</p>
<p>In fact, programming is not the difficult part. Re-programming is the novel aspect of Design that computers bring to the world. We have been programming machines to do  <em>single</em>  things for centuries (using metal lathes, etc.). This time through, though, we have built machines capable of doing  <em>many</em>  things.</p>

(1) is the circuit itself and (2) a schematic on paper for other Engineers to read. You can understand (1), but you have to spend time to reverse-engineer what’s there. #2 is (usually) more useful in communicating to other Engineers what is going on, without needing them to reverse engineer the actual circuit #1. You still have to spend a few years in university to understand #2, but, once you learn how to read #2, you can devise circuits and show other Engineers what you intended to accomplish. Likewise, Structural Engineers build bridges with bolts and I-beams, and built human-understandable drawings using blueprints. Programmers are trying to squeeze both #1 and #2 into the same notation. AFAICT, concern #1 usually wins and programmers have to spend time reverse-engineering code, since #2 doesn’t exist. In programming, programmers  <em>should</em>  be able to create #1 from #2, but, instead programmers create #1 from #1 and leave #2 mostly unaddressed.</p>

<p>A schematic or a blueprint are a state description optimized for legibility, so there is complexity missing, which is present in the instantiation of the schematic or blueprint in the real world. I believe the same could be said about the process description of an algorithm, which leaves out the actual values that are processed when the program runs.</p>

<ul><li><em>State</em>  descriptions are  <em>declarative</em>  and describe the  <em>spatial structure</em>  of the result.</li><li><em>Process</em>  descriptions are  <em>imperative</em>  and describe the  <em>temporal behavior</em>  of how to  <em>generate</em>  a result.</li></ul><p>But both are generalizable in the sense that they are both abstract descriptions, leaving out detail.</p>
<p>I suspect what makes them feel qualitatively different is the cross-over from temporal to spatial domain in one that’s missing in the other. When programmers have to inspect the actual result — the running program in a debugger that makes state visible — then they “have arrived” on the same level the electrical/structural engineers operate at. But usually programmers describe the thing that “builds” the thing, whereas engineers build the thing. (Which is why I asked previously <a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/to-build-or-not-to-build">To build or not to build?</a>)</p>
<p>“But what about  <em>declarative</em>  programming languages?”</p>
<p>While they tend to describe results and are less concerned about the process, they are still ultimately generative — they generate a result from specific input (functional programming) or from axioms (logical programming).</p>

I agree that blueprints are state descriptions. I agree that programs are process descriptions. I believe that electronics schematics are  <em>both</em> , though - blueprints  <em>and</em>  recipes. Schematics contain a lot of implementation details. I think that the difference between schematics and code is that you can lasso areas on schematics and treat them in a stand-alone manner, whereas you can’t do this with code (programmers are only “fooled” into believing that they can). Items on electronic schematics are loosely-coupled (asynchronous) whereas items in code are tightly-coupled (synchronous). I hope to elaborate…</p>

<p>I’ve observed the same issue with secondary goals, where they are discussed outside the context of primary goals.</p>
<p>I don’t know if this bothers other people, but it bothers me a lot. Maybe I’m not smart enough to see the implied connections.</p>
<p>One example I can give is that many times I’ve been given the goal of “consistency,” whether in the UI or the code style. I’m not saying “consistency” is a bad thing, but without connecting it to the primary pre-shared goal, the value of this secondary goal becomes trivial and nullified. Logically, it doesn’t make sense either, especially for a start-up, because a start-up is doing something new, and you can’t do new things by pursuing consistency. If we did things consistently, we’d still be using XML instead of JSON.</p>
<p>Again, to be clear, I’m not saying doing things consistently is bad. I’m just saying that, for me, when given the goal of “consistency” without the context of why it’s important for our primary goal, I’d be much more motivated.</p>
<p>Another example is “patterns.” I think initially “patterns” are just solutions to some pre-existing problems, but we put too much emphasis on them to the point where we forget about the goals of these patterns, and the patterns themselves become the goal. To be clear, I’m not saying patterns are bad or that we shouldn’t use them. We should know them, in the same way we should know other just-in-case knowledge, to perform better. Some patterns are just cool, and we derive joy from them, the same way we get joy from movies and music. I’m just saying we probably shouldn’t treat them as primary goals (unless in school, I guess, where you get points for implementing a pattern).</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, this may just be a communication issue within an organization, where secondary goals are communicated without the connection to primary goals. I’ve never worked in a big organization, and I wonder how they do it. Also, am I alone in this? Do other people feel demoralized too when given just a secondary goal?</p>

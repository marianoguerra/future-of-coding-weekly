It's kinda hard to even describe this eldritch horror, so bear with me:</p>
<ul><li>I have a tab. It has Slack loaded on it all working. ðŸŽˆ</li><li>I switch tabs, go off and interact with some other site.</li><li>After some time I return to my Slack tab.</li><li>I'm faced with a white page with a tiny spinner in its geometric center. ðŸ’¥</li><li>A few (1-5) seconds later Slack returns. There's no sign of a page reload or anything.</li><li>I had to double-check, but I've definitely not restarted my browser or even closed the lid on my laptop in the interim.</li></ul><p>What.. is this? Is this some new idea in web development? I can't imagine what benefit it could possibly provide anyone. Is it a bug affecting just my computer? I can't conceive what sort of error of omission might lead to it.</p>

Like, the JS notices that it's been in the background for a while, meaning it doesn't get to check for fresh data, so instead of showing stale data they just block the ui and hit the server when you come back.</p>

So the idea is that Slack is so mission-critical it can't afford to risk showing outdated information.. ðŸ˜‚</p>

<p>This behavior could be just one of those things e.g. bad client side code. Or a combination e.g. a device with "data saver" settings working with the browser to aggressively background inactive tabs not playing nicely with a service worker.</p>
<p>As a data point I'm using Slack in the browser on MacOS and haven't seen this.</p>

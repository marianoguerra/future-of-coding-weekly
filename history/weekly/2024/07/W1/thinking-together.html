<p>I'd like to read/watch/hear critical reviews of programming tools that approach them not as bundles of features and capabilities, but as authored works that reflect a creative intent and as cultural touchstones and as environments or artifacts within which one can have deeply personal experiences.</p>
<p>A. Do you share my interest?</p>
<p>B. Do you know any such critics?</p>

<p>What's the <a href="http://howlongtobeat.com">howlongtobeat.com</a> of programming? Is that an absurd question? Well, what sort of crowdsourced metrics would we find helpful when selecting a new language to enjoy. We could certainly do better than GitHub stars and download counts.</p>

I enjoy reading reviews, especially multiple reviews for the same work that disagree wildly, especially reviews that zoom in to critique tiny details and decisions and zoom out to situate the work within a movement or cultural moment.</p>
<p>I usually think of programming tools as being environments because I don't separate the experience of the language from the editor. My experience comes from the interplay of both. Writing TS in VSCode is a different experience from writing TS in Nova or HTML in VSCode. (Edit: on second thought, I don't think this pertains to my meaning in the original post. Will have to come back to that later.)</p>
<p>Does that help? I'm fumbling around in the dark a bit, so apologies if this is coming across more obtuse than it ought to. I think the idea is pretty small.</p>

<p>Like, does Haskell get a 5/10 or a 3/10, and why? (From a given reviewer)</p>
<p>Anyone who feels like this is absurd: yes! Lean into that.</p>

<p>We have all sorts of reviews like that. They are just called “why we are leaving x” or “why we chose y”. </p>

<p>Mindstorms by Seymour Papert and Apple Logo by Harold Abelson are good examples of this. </p>
<p>Abelson wrote the book decades before he sold his soul to whitewash MITs culpability in the death of Aaron Swartz, and it is a very good book, so when I read it I try to believe that the author was a good man when he was writing it.</p>

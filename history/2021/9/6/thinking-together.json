But <@UCGAK10LS> was talking about (sparse) \"tensors\" as a _low-level_ model of actual hardware memory of \"tensor processors\", and in reality this processors can _efficiently_ handle only numerical (and packed boolean, yes) computations. As soon as we throw pointers (or indexes into _other_ tensors) in the mix and start chasing them the \"model\" breaks and efficiency plummets. Thus I claim \"tensor operations are only *good* for numerical computations\". :grin:",

It is a huge topic, but I'll attempt (perhaps foolishly) a summarization.\n\nSociocracy is a framework for self-governance of a group of people. This could be anything from a book club with your friends to a large corporation. In my mind, the main pillars of sociocracy are: consent, circles, and feedback.\n\n1. *Consent*: sociocracy takes \"consent of the governed\" very seriously. Every decision of a sociocratic circle must be made with the consent of everyone that is a member of that circle. Lots of people think this is impossible, but I assure you it isn't. The key to making this work is to try to find a course of action that is within everyone's \"range of tolerance.\" That is, the decision doesn't have to be everyone's preference, they don't have to like it, they just have to be \"okay with it.\" Finding a solution within the area of \"I can live with it\" is a LOT easier than finding a solution that makes everyone happy. Indeed, the later is often impossible.\n2. *Circles*: a sociocratic circle is the fundamental unit of organization within sociocracy. A circle can optionally have one or more Child Circles, if the organization is large enough to warrant it. Each circle in sociocracy has an AIM (a reason for existing), a DOMAIN (area of authority), a TERM (how long it exists), and MEMBERS. A circle also has ROLES: 1) _Lead_: think \"project manager\" for the circle. Doesn't actually make the decisions (remember that is by consent of the members of that circle) but rather supports the circle so that it is still headed towards its AIM. 2) _Facilitator_: simply someone who ensures circle meetings run smoothly and are in service of the AIM. 3) _Secretary_: the person tasked with \"making sense\" of the circle's activities, recording minutes, logging decisions, etc. and 4) _Delegate_: see below.\n3. *Feedback*: The Delegate is the circle member tasked with pairing with the Lead to ensure the free flow of information from a Child Circle to a Parent Circle by virtue of being members of both circles. With this free flow of information and consent from \"top\" to \"bottom\" an organization becomes very aware of how well things are working at all \"levels\". Paring this with circle (and policy, and role) TERMS, sociocracy enables a dynamic, self-healing, and fluid structure of self-governance.\nIf you'd like to learn more about sociocracy, I highly recommend \"Many Voices, One Song\" by Ted Rau and Jerry Koch-Gonzalez <https:\/\/www.sociocracyforall.org\/> And I can give a talk about it, if folks are interested.

I agree, I think computation (more specifically in my mind \"the internet\") is the most powerful tool we currently have. It allows us to connect in ways that were unimaginable not long ago.\n\nI may be biased (I am a worker-owner at a coop) but I think it is widely held that supporting coops in all forms is a relatively proven plan to get us to a less exploitative, less extractive (less capitalist) world. If I remember correctly, the United Nations called 2012 \"the year of the coop\", and indeed coops have been sprouting up all over the place recently.\n\nIt's never been easier to start a new coop, or convert an existing business into a coop. The Democracy at Work Institute <https:\/\/institute.coop\/> has highly recommended programs to do exactly that. And the U.S. Federation of Worker Cooperatives <https:\/\/www.usworker.coop\/home\/> , an organization dedicated to supporting the coop movement, has seen explosive growth in the past few years.\n\nThere is a new coop in NYC <https:\/\/drivers.coop\/> that is competing with Uber and Lyft for their market and surprisingly doing very well. Each driver is an equal owner of that company, and each given a vote in how it is operated.\n\nSo in summary, I'd say \"jump in, the water's fine\" :)",

We could consent to creating one giant \"Future of Coding\" circle, with everyone in the server being a member. But since that circle is so big and thus decision-making would take so long, we might instead decide to create multiple, smaller, independent circles like a \"Systems Thinking Circle\", and a \"Cybernetics Circle\", and a \"Blue Sky Circle\" and then each of those circles has 2 members that are also members of an overarching \"Guiding Council of FoC Circle.\" It would really depend on what everyone is okay with.

Discussion boards are full of people who on the one hand have never met irl, but on the other are self-selected and potentially hold a lot of subcultural norms and values in common. From what I understand so far about the new coop concepts, they seem to have a lot in common with software licensing: simple explanations, backed up by real contracts and precedents, designed to encourage trust among distributed groups of strangers."

I have seen references to sociocracy before, but it's your summary that got me interested in digging deeper.\n\nMy first question (as with nearly every new idea I see) is: what are the limits? In which situations would sociocracy not be appropriate? I always ask myself such questions early on because (1) nothing is perfect and universal and (2) it's best to explore some space being aware of where its walls are.\n\nSomething that does look like such a wall to me is decisions requiring expertise. How would consent work if 90% of the circle do not understand the impact of the decision they are making?\n\nOur FoC community also looks like an inappropriate place for sociocracy, though I may well have overlooked something. We are a low-stake community for everyone involved. There aren't that many decisions to take, and they are mostly about how to deal with exceptional rather than regular situations. Any organized form of decision taking then looks like overkill. A benevolent dictator (which is how I see <@UC2A2ARPT>'s de-facto role, although I expect him to protest) is probably a pretty good arrangement in such cases.",

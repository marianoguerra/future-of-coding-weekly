        "text": "I'm thinking more about the _sensation of time_, as it pertains to the execution of code. (Yeah, back on my bullshit.) I see a spectrum here — a spectrum of different sensations of time for different ways we interact with computation.\n\nOn one end of the spectrum, we have raw math. There's not supposed to be any sensation of time in the evaluation of math. A variable _always_ has a specific value; relationships either exist or they don't. It might take you (or a computer) some time to crunch values and arrive at a result, but that's _absolutely_ _not_ supposed to be part of the aesthetic. Conal Elliot's Denotational Design is an application of this sort of thinking to software design. Lambda calculus, Curry-Howard, and some of the more hardcore FP languages all exist — infinitely, suspended frozen in midair — over here. Of course, no computer language is _actually_ timeless (that violated physics, and this is addressed in Church-Turing and related work, and we all agree never to try that again), but the desired _sensation_ — the aesthetic — is one in which time is not a constraint or concern.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, we have mechanical computers. There's no avoiding the sensation of time when operating these clockwork beasts. You're required to think about the passage of time as you plan an execution, or else the result will be nonsense, or malfunction. Nothing is instant, nothing exists until you build it. Here we find the CAP theorem, Turing machines, and Rich Hickey's The Language of the System, all of them toiling, sweating, grinding, churning.\n\n[Aside: note that Functional Programming is orthogonal to this spectrum — it is not bound to the _math_ side. On either extreme and anywhere in between, you can have programming that's about immutable values (or not), static vs dynamic binding, data &amp; behaviour co-located (or not), for-each vs map, place-oriented vs value-oriented, and so forth.]\n\nI've spent all my time over in the _mechanical labour camp_ — this is where Hest lives. So I don't have much insight at all into the _crystal tower of pure evaluation_. So beyond just suggesting \"Hey, talk about this spectrum\" (which, granted, I am suggesting), I'd also like to know what examples you can point to that obviously violate this common alignment of aesthetics. For example: what's the most _*I feel the passage of time in execution*_ you can get to when working with something like Coq, or Haskell, or APL? Is there some step debugger for SML that really lets you feel the iterative progress through execution? Or on the other side, what's out there that takes a process rooted in time — like CAP — and makes it shake that feeling of temporality? Look at something like Erlang\/OTP — they take Prolog (timeless) and reify the sensation of process (\"let it fail\"). Who else is doing that? Is anyone doing it in the other direction?",

It does seem a useful reasonable goal that lower levels of the stack not throw exceptions (same as \"require applications to specify error handling at all times\"?) It's also useful to provide a back-channel for data flow that better fits the way a single app's developer is likely to think. The trouble often is that, having provided an exception mechanism in system software, there's a temptation to use it for system software. In the spirit of self-hosting, dogfooding and so on. Perhaps that's the problem? It's good to give people the ability to demote some code paths, that they can use to taste. But it's also good not to require the use of those code paths in libraries. I wonder if this is the nub of the disagreement every time the subject of exceptions comes up (ever since <https:\/\/www.joelonsoftware.com\/2003\/10\/13\/13>)\n\nOn the subject of Common Lisp's interactive condition system, do people have any links to resources for learning more? Particularly tutorials with working code. A long-standing frustration of mine with Common Lisp: extremely low hit rate when I try to type in code fragments from blog posts. More than other languages, Common Lisp blog posts tend to assume a baseline level of knowledge -- about asdf, editor setup, what to load from a file, what to type in at the REPL -- that I've never been able to attain. (Most recent example of this: <https:\/\/pvk.ca\/Blog\/2014\/03\/15\/sbcl-the-ultimate-assembly-code-breadboard>. Though now I notice it's from 2014, so never mind.)",

It does seem a useful reasonable goal that lower levels of the stack not throw exceptions (same as \"require applications to specify error handling at all times\"?) It's also useful to provide a back-channel for data flow that better fits the way a single app's developer is likely to think. The trouble often is that, having provided an exception mechanism in system software, there's a temptation to use it for system software. In the spirit of self-hosting, dogfooding and so on. Perhaps that's the problem? It's good to give people the ability to demote some code paths, that they can use to taste. But it's also good not to require the use of those code paths in libraries. I wonder if this is the nub of the disagreement every time the subject of exceptions comes up (ever since "

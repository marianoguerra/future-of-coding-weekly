I'm so accustomed to non-live programming that I forget about the completely different sensation of time that you get from a live environment, where state is can be thought of as non-volatile by default.\n\n<@UDQBTJ211> — I like that your two comments are \"here's why [existing thing] is what it is\" and \"here's what I want to exist\". Both make sense to me!\n\n<@UBN9AFS0N> — Queued! Though unlike Lamport's earlier work (you know, _the hits_), this one looks like it might fly over my head a bit :$\n\n<@UJFN50C00> — Croquet sure is interesting, hey? Though I'm not sure how it relates here — I can imagine ways, but if you had something specific about it you wanted to highlight that'd be appreciated.\n\n<@UJZS8UUJV> — You're right, I under-considered what I was saying there. I was focused on pointing out that you _can_ have all that conventionally \"functional\" stuff within a programming system that does feel very mechanical \/ process-oriented. I didn't consider enough whether it's possible to have the non-FP stuff within a system that feels timeless. Good point, will have to think about this some more.\n\n<@UEBG0NPDK> — Nice pulls! I suppose the same applies to RT OSes, CAN Bus (etc), and perhaps even programming within a high-end game engine (eg: frame cadence, Carmack's preference for algorithms that are slower average-case with less variability, etc). Would love to just be able to just... order a study on this.",

        "text": "ok, stream of conciousness incoming...\n\nOn the concept of math vs mechanics, I perceive math as this vast graph that always exists, but in imagination. Mechanics is about materializing parts of this graph in some physical form. The machine manifests a subset of this graph, and _traverses_ to other nodes, pulling in more and more of this graph, from the imaginary to the physical, as physical time progresses. If you type `2 + 3` in a system, you've got a graph with three nodes (2, 3, +, connected in a nice tree) and after some time, you've got a 4th node (5, connected to the [2,3+] bundle of nodes), but in mathland all 4 nodes (and the edges and more) pre-existed.\n\nOn the intersection of these ideas, CRDTs come to mind. You have the semi-lattice, which is very mathematical and static. However you have the actual values at different nodes, which correspond to one node in the lattice at any point in time, but they change over time and eventually _walk up_ the math lattice to meet at the top.\n\nCroquet came to my mind as well when reading the prompt. On the surface it is full-mechanical. The machines moves, step by step, and is implemented in that style. However look between steps - each step is functional, it *must* be deterministic - that's what keeps all the different systems in sync. There is no logical time within a step (e.g. can be considered instantaneous.. the next input cannot interrupt a step).",

The machines moves, step by step, and is implemented in that style. However look between steps - each step is functional, it *must* be deterministic - that's what keeps all the different systems in sync. There is no logical time within a step (e.g. can be considered instantaneous.. the next input cannot interrupt a step)."

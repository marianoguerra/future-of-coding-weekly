I don't have any real professional or academic background in language development or future-of-code adjacent work, but it's something I've been interested in for a long time. I am particularly interested in the struggle between highly interactive, live-coding, \"fun\" programming and the more serious and verifiable\/reliable\/compiled processes.\nI don't really have any work to share _yet_ but I think that engaging with the community here can help me remain motivated and interested in projects (working full-time as a software engineer can sap your enthusiasm for fun research stuff outside of work.)",

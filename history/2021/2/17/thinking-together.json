It allows code quite similar to the example `let y = f`  if `f` or its parameter is marked as `implicit` . `implicit` can be used at the value and at the type level. At the value level - they are mostly used to reduce boilerplate; for example; passing around a db connection throughout the callstack could be done by marking it as an implicit parameter; and then not having to explicitly pass it on a function invocation.\nAt the type level - it is used to support a number of the advanced Scala language features.\n\nI would say its a very actively used feature of the language. Scala has a new major release coming  in which a number of the lessons learned from Scala 2 are being used to refine some areas of the language design and `implicts` are getting quite a bit of a rework; so could be an interesting case study.",

You'd like to strip out some structure, but not by throwing it away, but by putting it on the shelf. You'd then like to do some modification on the less structured representation (editing the plain text file). And the dream would be to magically add the structure back in, with help of the structure you put on the shelf. It's obviously an ill-posed problem in general, but as I understand it, the research in bidirectional transformations is to characterize when the problem has a solution.\n\nMy opinion is that it is generally not possible to find one all-encompassing structure for your data that does everything you'd ever possibly hope for. Not to mention that there are countless existing structures that you might want to interoperate with.\n\nFor example, I could see myself arguing \"well, if you had to remove structure to make the plain text more convenient to edit in your text editor, that's just a tooling issue. A better text editing tool would allow you to more conveniently edit HTML files\". Not only would I be requiring your text editor to be a lot more sophisticated (probably to the extent of solving ill-posed problems), I would also be failing to leverage the workflow and tooling developed over decades upon decades for editing plain text.",

And the dream would be to magically add the structure back in, with help of the structure you put on the shelf. It's obviously an ill-posed problem in general, but as I understand it, the research in bidirectional transformations is to characterize when the problem has a solution.\n\nMy opinion is that it is generally not possible to find one all-encompassing structure for your data that does everything you'd ever possibly hope for. Not to mention that there are countless existing structures that you might want to interoperate with.\n\nFor example, I could see myself arguing \"well, if you had to remove structure to make the plain text more convenient to edit in your text editor, that's just a tooling issue. A better text editing tool would allow you to more conveniently edit HTML files\". Not only would I be requiring your text editor to be a lot more sophisticated (probably to the extent of solving ill-posed problems), I would also be failing to leverage the workflow and tooling developed over decades upon decades for editing plain text."

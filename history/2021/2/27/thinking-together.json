I find it more interesting to reflect on how the terms _user_ and _programmer_ have changed since then.\n\nBack then, computers weren't as commercialized, but also not as widely spread as they are today. The distinction between users and programmers was much smaller or didn't really exist, because back then, if you were using a computer, you were likely programming it.\n\nReading Engelbart, or any of the other early computer pioneers, you pick up this enthusiastic spirit of possibility that personal computers will one day become a new medium (I believe Alan Kay later called it \"personal dynamic medium\") that will finally enable everyone to express themselves much more creatively, because it was interactive.\n\nBut commercial uses of computers in businesses were more after automation than augmentation. And then the WWW happened and there was lots of money to be made in dumbed-down experiences that didn't require users to \"learn the tool\" at all. Just click the blue underlined text or what looks like a button.\n\nOn the plus side, now almost everybody has a smartphone and knows how to navigate the web and communicate through social media. But there is so much more power in that little device in everybody's hands…",

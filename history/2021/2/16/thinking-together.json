        "text": "I've been thinking about an alternative approach to \"function calling\" (particularly, for *declarative* languages). Instead of having _*functions*_, where every invocation must explicitly feed in every argument, what if:\n• we define a language that supports only _*expressions containing free variables*_, and\n• we treat invocation as merely (lazy) syntactic substitution, thus arguments are \"retrieved\" from the scope where the expression is _invoked_\nFor example, I write `let f = x * x` (note the absence of a parameter list) and then later write `let x = 3; let y = f` , which sets y to 9.\nIt's important for the substitution to be lazy, since this retains the semantics of traditional functions, including the ability to make _recursive_ definitions. Given this, I don't believe I'm re-inventing macros, though I welcome enlightenment.\nYou can combine this with the usual nested syntactic scoping rules, so it's definitely _not_ the same as using global variables, or the same as closures (where all the free variables are bound at the _definition_ site). The only practical difference seems to be the UX, and the biggest UX downside is probably readability (which invocations consume which values?), but I'm confident an IDE can make the data flow more explicit.\nAdvantages of this approach:\n• Certain programs can become much more concise. For example, in drawing code, you can set the drawing `color` just once, and it will be automatically consumed by all drawing functions (i.e. expressions-with-free-variables) that are invoked in that scope. This actually obviates the \"type classes\" feature that functional languages often pursue. (Type classes aim to enable exactly this kind of \"implicit argument passing\", but achieve it in a more convoluted way.)\n• You've removed the concept of a \"function call\" entirely from the language. You only need substitution (i.e. referencing). Less features is better, when all else is equal.\nDisadvantages of this approach:\n• As mentioned earlier, it may be harder to understand which values are being consumed where. But I'm confident that an IDE can make this clear. (I'm building a language based on ASTs and structured editing anyway, so it's guaranteed to be combined with a sufficiently-smart IDE.)\n• You need to worry about \"accidental variable capture\", where a variable which _just happens_ to be in scope is accidentally used by a function (i.e. expression) invocation. I think this is a real problem in languages where variables are identified by _*text strings*_, but FWIW, the language I'm designing is _not_ based on text strings, and so can be designed in such a way that a local variable will never _accidentally_ have the same UUID as a free variable found in a function (i.e. expression). In an AST-based language, every function definition should _by default_ use unique UUIDs for its free variables. Only _related functions_ from the same library should share UUIDs, for example the `color` variable used in a drawing library should be the same across all drawing functions.\nI'd love to hear others' thoughts. Has this been tried before? Are there additional advantages or disadvantages that I've missed? Is it worth a try? Note that I'm thinking specifically about declarative languages here. Imperative languages _may_ add complications (but may not!).",

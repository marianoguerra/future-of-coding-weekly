I think there's an important piece of the story missing, though: how do you learn? You called it out yourself: if you don't know how le nix works, you walk out in disgust (and more than likely embarrassment). Anybody can walk into Smilies and end up eating the food they want. I think there's a number of dimensions to this as well. What does this learning mean? Is it about the developer community? The documentation? A cs degree vs. a bootcamp? Formally educated vs. self-taught?",

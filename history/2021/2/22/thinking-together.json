        "text": "Here is my understanding of your problems:\n\n1. problem #1: on-boarding\n2. problem #2: user history in the tool\n3. problem #3: allow users convenient access to parallel state machines\n\n[I think that you are generating code from users’ diagrams.  I think that you are joining the generated code to the XState library.  There are 2 different use-cases: (1) designing your tool, (2) generating code from users’ diagrams.  XState can be used for both use-cases (or just one)].\n\n1. problem #1: How to get users to love dealing with details.  They don’t.  Give them eye-candy until they buy-in.\n\nProblem #1: Yes, designing using StateCharts makes you think about details.  Users live in a fictional reality hoping that _you_ will solve all of _their_ detailed problems.  That’s why neophytes like to use BASIC and Excel (and JavaScript, Python, etc).\n\nProblem #1: Give them layers, but, don’t make them use layers immediately.  Users want “flat”, but that leads to later trouble.  Give them flat until they need more.  (Also, see Ports, in #3).  Don’t mention the fact that the “flat” layers will interconnect, once they need them to.\n\n2. problem #2: History.  The UX depends on your users - what do they want to see?  Your job boils down into (a) designing a decent UX and (b) hooking what users see, in the UX, into the generated XState code.\n\n3. problem #3: Parallel State Machines. Harel’s notation for Orthogonal States falls short (IMO) here.  in StateChart notation, state transitions are explicit (curvy arrows) _except_ when you use Orthogonal States, which can only be implied by reading the code.\n\nHow to present this to users?\n\nMy suggestion:\n\nPeel orthogonality out of user-level HSM’s and put explicit ports on the user-level HSM’s (HSM === Hierarchical State Machine).\n\nJoin ports up using explicit lines (arrows, different color, whatever).\n\nDesign it so that the users must (explicitly) wire up output ports to input (watcher) ports.\n\nDesign it so that every user-HSM is completely self-contained.\n\nDesign it so that a user-HSM can only send “state-changed” events to one of its own output ports.  Every user-HSM can observe (listen-to) “state-changed” events from other user-HSMs only-iff their ports are connected in the UX.\n\nCan an HSM send other kinds of events to its output ports?  (A: yes.  Ask me for more discussion, if this interests you.  I am happy to discuss further).\n\n4. problem #0: Go to a whiteboard and draw the design of your tool on the whiteboard.  (Use StateChart notation, if you wish).  (Most programmers skip this step and go straight to implementation using JS, Python, Rust, etc.)",

That’s why neophytes like to use BASIC and Excel (and JavaScript, Python, etc).\n\nProblem #1: Give them layers, but, don’t make them use layers immediately.  Users want “flat”, but that leads to later trouble.  Give them flat until they need more.  (Also, see Ports, in #3).  Don’t mention the fact that the “flat” layers will interconnect, once they need them to.\n\n2. problem #2: History.  The UX depends on your users - what do they want to see?  Your job boils down into (a) designing a decent UX and (b) hooking what users see, in the UX, into the generated XState code.\n\n3. problem #3: Parallel State Machines. Harel’s notation for Orthogonal States falls short (IMO) here.  in StateChart notation, state transitions are explicit (curvy arrows) _except_ when you use Orthogonal States, which can only be implied by reading the code.\n\nHow to present this to users?\n\nMy suggestion:\n\nPeel orthogonality out of user-level HSM’s and put explicit ports on the user-level HSM’s (HSM === Hierarchical State Machine).\n\nJoin ports up using explicit lines (arrows, different color, whatever).\n\nDesign it so that the users must (explicitly) wire up output ports to input (watcher) ports.\n\nDesign it so that every user-HSM is completely self-contained.\n\nDesign it so that a user-HSM can only send “state-changed” events to one of its own output ports.  Every user-HSM can observe (listen-to) “state-changed” events from other user-HSMs only-iff their ports are connected in the UX.\n\nCan an HSM send other kinds of events to its output ports?  (A: yes.  Ask me for more discussion, if this interests you.  I am happy to discuss further).\n\n4. problem #0: Go to a whiteboard and draw the design of your tool on the whiteboard.  (Use StateChart notation, if you wish).  (Most programmers skip this step and go straight to implementation using JS, Python, Rust, etc.)"

Explanations were generated in the logic programming\/graph theoretical part of the system.\n2. The statistical part of the NLP system fed things upward to the ontology-driven inferencer, which found paths between taxonomic entities that had linguistic stems attached to them (the KB was first statistically derived from our multi-terabyte collection of manuals, then improved by the analysts). It was able to reload and recompute an entire knowledge base in &lt;2 seconds, partially by doing much of the work in parallel on a many-core machine. It was also able to keep multiple versions online at once to do comparison and diffs.\n3. RDF is a mixed bag, and certain parts of it (complete open world assumption, for example) would only have made life harder in this context.\n4. See (2), more or less.\nGOFAI advantages include size of the needed training corpus and transparency of the system's function, but many tasks -- anything resembling sensing\/perception -- are better handled with a probabilistic approach. So, for example, it's easy to find large corpora of English language text -- even labeled! -- on which to train NLP models, and the kind of text we were dealing with was intentionally unambiguous (repair manuals!), so we were able to get very good statistical parse trees for most sentences and text fragments. But entity linking was a bit harder because of variability in how terms were used in the texts, so we needed a way to disambiguate various kinds of shorthand based on context, which turned out to be amenable to graph theoretical algorithms over a knowledge base. The KB also held a variety of other useful information about parts and tools, such as their catalog numbers so we could convert references in the manual to purchase links (quite important to our acquirer).",

So, for example, it's easy to find large corpora of English language text -- even labeled! -- on which to train NLP models, and the kind of text we were dealing with was intentionally unambiguous (repair manuals!), so we were able to get very good statistical parse trees for most sentences and text fragments. But entity linking was a bit harder because of variability in how terms were used in the texts, so we needed a way to disambiguate various kinds of shorthand based on context, which turned out to be amenable to graph theoretical algorithms over a knowledge base. The KB also held a variety of other useful information about parts and tools, such as their catalog numbers so we could convert references in the manual to purchase links (quite important to our acquirer)."

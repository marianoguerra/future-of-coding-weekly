E.g., GarageBand, Korg Gadget, and Auxy all represent a different, simpler, philosophy for music production than desktop DAWs.\n\nCorrespondingly, it appears to me that a lot of the complexity in DAWs is incidental complexity in supporting an open systems, e.g., hosting plugins, audio routing between applications (nuts to me that this isn't just a standardized OS-level feature), MIDI\/MPE\/OSC for interfacing with hardware.\n\nAuxy and Korg Gadget achieve their simplicity by being closed (e.g., no support for Audio Units), so their simplicity comes at the expense of flexibility. GarageBand also achieves it's simplicity while being less flexible, albeit it can at least host plugins.\n\nThere's also the AUM\/Audiobus ecosystem iOS, which has a fundamentally different approach (arguably even more modular then desktop DAWS, e.g., unbundling the sequencer from the mixer) to desktop DAWs, but it ends up being equally complex.\n\nNot a great situation, but it appears to me that complexity seems to always come with open, flexible, workflows. I'd love to hear counterexamples of this, e.g., apps that are both powerful and simple? Are those always contradictory?",

In fact, one participant in a different study used undo\/redo 40 times in 5 minutes! When asked why they did this, they revealed they were trying to view some intermediate state of the code in the middle of a change. Why is it so hard to see code from 5 minutes ago while in the middle of a change?\nThe author later presents a prototype named Yestercode\n\n&gt; It lets you _swipe_ through your code history on a timeline, much like you would a YouTube video. As you make edits, it aggregates them and puts a notch on the timeline for that version. You can then use the timeline to go to a previous version, giving you a side-by-side view with the current version of the code. The previous version is read-only, but still allows copying and pasting from it. It also shows annotations so that you know what has been changed in later versions (much like a diff).\n<https:\/\/web.eecs.utk.edu\/~azh\/blog\/yestercode.html>",

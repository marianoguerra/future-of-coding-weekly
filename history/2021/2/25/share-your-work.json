Although I and westoncb tried to solve different problems, the resulting \"look &amp; feel\" is similar when our lines shift up and down with smooth animation. You <@USJ899UUD> seem to value high framerates and distinct visual &amp; auditory feedback - did you also work on games, by any chance? I find that level of polish to be common in games but depressingly rare in most other software.\n\nDammit, now I can't help but fantasize about how to combine your TiledText editing with my varying font sizes... You're right that simply shrinking the font size as a function of tree depth wouldn't be good enough, because no one wants to select, cut&amp;paste text that's 3px high. That's why the active line in <https:\/\/emilprogviz.com\/stretchy-code-map\/toggle.html|my prototype> is always at full size. In TiledText you probably want all lines that you're cycling through to be at full size? But other lines, that are not in the current cycle, could vary? So when functions are collapsed, for example like on the 1st frame of <https:\/\/youtu.be\/tztmgCcZaM4|your demo video>, maybe instead of being completely collapsed to 1 line, the function bodies could be displayed with the tree-depth-scaling method, quite small, as \"thumbnails\" or \"previews\" of what you'll see when you expand them. There's a part in the video where you say \"let me go to a longer method real quick\" and open the right one by memory, but with \"thumbnails\" you wouldn't need to remember. There's ofc a trade-off between making the cycle-list maximally compact, and making the \"thumbnails\" readable, but that's a knob one can turn to find a sweet spot.\n\nHmm, there's some more overlap coming in my next video, number #5. I wonder if there a term for when we're trying to solve different problems, and still end up with similar solutions. Not exactly \"convergent evolution\", but close.\n\nSidetrack: I've always wanted a good visualizer of data structures, and I had started to sketch out the basics when I saw westoncb's work <http:\/\/symbolflux.com\/projects\/avd|Lucidity> a few years back, which made me promptly drop my own project because you seem to be already creating exactly the kind of visualization I wanted.

For those who haven't seen our previous work, we are working on Wasp (<https:\/\/wasp-lang.dev>) - an open source DSL for building full-stack web apps. We have been applying to YC for the last year or so, and finally managed to get in. We are still in pre-alpha, but we are excited about this as it gives us an opportunity to give a harder push to possibly making Wasp become a real thing. This community has been a great help in the last year, both with providing feedback and inspiration, so thanks for that - I always wish to participate more and return back some of that, I hope I will manage to do more of it in the upcoming time.\nBtw, in case you would like to show some support, we are on HackerNews right now, on frontpage (<https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/news>)!",

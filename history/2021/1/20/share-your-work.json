The `TreeNode` interface is clear enough as a building block for trees, but what about grids? I think that's the problem I have since the beginning: is a grid just an interpretation of a particular tree structure, as in the frequent representation of a 2D arrays as rows of 1D arrays? Or is a grid a distinct data structure from a tree? Put differently, in terms of syntax: is grid notation just syntactic sugar for a frequently used kind of tree, or syntax for a different data type? Again put differently: can a grid have semantics different from any tree-based semantics?",

It is probable that I will write a Loyc tree library for Python before I get around to doing something involving tree-hugger + .NET.\n\nA couple of days ago I sketched out something called BLES, which is a syntax for Loyc trees designed as an extension of JSON (and subset of LES2). In these grammar diagrams, the things BLES has in common with JSON are shown in black, while changes are shown in blue. It looks about twice as complex as JSON, but probably about one-quarter as complex as C. So this is something I could port to other languages more quickly than other versions of LES. There's also a <https:\/\/github.com\/qwertie\/ecsharp\/issues\/104|JSON encoding of Loyc trees> but I'm not sure if that's useful to anyone.",

It is probable that I will write a Loyc tree library for Python before I get around to doing something involving tree-hugger + .NET.\n\nA couple of days ago I sketched out something called BLES, which is a syntax for Loyc trees designed as an extension of JSON (and subset of LES2). In these grammar diagrams, the things BLES has in common with JSON are shown in black, while changes are shown in blue. It looks about twice as complex as JSON, but probably about one-quarter as complex as C. So this is something I could port to other languages more quickly than other versions of LES. There's also a "

And yeah, Chris's feedback is good.\n\nIn any case it's very cool that you can implement a sorting algorithm in this manner."

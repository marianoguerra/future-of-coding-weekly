I've got a couple of questions regarding this and would like to hear your thoughts:\n1. When did you have to deal with corrupted files and what was causing the corruption? \n2. How did the corruption look like (single swapped bits, part of the file missing, ...)? \nMy current line of thought is that small errors in binary files could simply be corrected by adding redundency to the format (crc etc.) and larger missing parts wouldn't be easy to recover from in text formats as well. Therefore the argument wouldn't make much sense. I'm curious what you might have experienced as I can't remember to have seen corrupted files in the last couple of years.",

With binary files, usually your parser just barfs. All the recovery steps a human performs have to be programmed in.\n\nAs to the actual question, the only time I can remember personally was from downloading ISOs: s couple of them failed their hash check and had to be re-downloaded. Bad disk dismounts are the other classic case, with a broader category of bad disk write\/flush handling that can leave a file in weird states (<https:\/\/danluu.com\/file-consistency\/|https:\/\/danluu.com\/file-consistency\/>). TBH I wouldn't want to hand-restore one of those files either.",

With binary files, usually your parser just barfs. All the recovery steps a human performs have to be programmed in.\n\nAs to the actual question, the only time I can remember personally was from downloading ISOs: s couple of them failed their hash check and had to be re-downloaded. Bad disk dismounts are the other classic case, with a broader category of bad disk write\/flush handling that can leave a file in weird states ("

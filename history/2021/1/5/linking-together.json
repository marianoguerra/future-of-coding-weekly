I basically agree with the first one regarding the reduction in the speed of progress over the named period, and I certainly remember the change in tech culture after the Netscape IPO: it brought many MBA\/Wall Street types into the industry and shifted the culture of the Valley from nerd concerns about doing cool things to greed-head concerns about getting rich.\n\nMy only disagreements, really, are: (a) that startups do sometimes manage to do research and ship new stuff, though that has become increasingly rare because of the aforementioned cultural factors (short runway\/fail fast\/MVP thinking); and (b) there's been a fair bit of interesting research over the intervening decades that mostly hasn't made any difference to end users--or even to most of the industry. For example, Racket's language-oriented programming stuff is great!\n\nThat said, there are other things that people rely on every day that are sort of invisible, like advances in distributed systems that have allowed reliability at scales that would have been hard to imagine in '96 and huge engineering improvements around non-parametric regression (which too many call \"AI\"), plus miniaturization and manufacturing improvements that allow all of us to carry around touchscreen supercomputers everywhere we go.\n\nThe second article is much more hit-or-miss. Many important pre-1996 improvements were done as open source projects. Some that I myself worked on include _bind_ (DNS), _sendmail_ (SMTP), converting EAY's open source SSL implementation to the still open source _openssl_ in the context of the _mod_ssl_ module for the open source web server _Apache_, the BSD kernel, and so on. Anyone reading this post probably used at least two of these technologies today, MacOS\/iOS users have likely benefitted from all four.\n\nThere's definitely a cultural problem around how modern OSS work is funded.  The idea that individuals should fund the projects they use out of after tax salary while companies carry on building empire on the backs of OSS contributors is grotesque, and I'm still fairly bitter that I wasn't able to get Google to put any money (beyond Summer of Code projects) into improving _emacs_ even though half their engineers were using it daily.\n\n&gt; it also killed the market for development of better software tools.

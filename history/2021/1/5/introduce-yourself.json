In particular, my goal is to bring more people into the Rust community and I'm working on applying some of the Bret Victor's and Papert's ideas in <https:\/\/lowlvl.org|Low-Level Academy>, which is intended to be a free &amp; open resource to learn about things like networking, operating systems, or virtual memory in an interactive and project-based fashion.\n\nI'm also exploring ideas about making <https:\/\/docs.rs\/std|Rust documentation> easier to understand, thinking about how to bring collaboration &amp; sharing into the interactive playgrounds, how to make them a11y-friendly, and about how to find time to work on all this stuff. :smile:",

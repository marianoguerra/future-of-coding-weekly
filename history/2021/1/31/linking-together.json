In my opinion, there are good arguments on both sides of the VPL vs. textual PL argument when you filter the irrelevant nonsense out (e.g. \"I can type faster than I can drag nodes\").\n\nGenerally, the discussion is about whether relations between parts of the system should be displayed visually (e.g. by lines connecting blocks) or implicitly by having the same name in two places (e.g. function declaration and function usage). The latter approach requires the programmer to imagine the structure in their head, which requires talent and experience to do well.\n\nHumans are great at understanding spacial structure, so explicitly showing that structure does make sense. If you don't want to take my word for it, look at all the UML stuff or programmers drawing pictures to communicate their ideas.\n\nOn the other hand, showing ALL relations doesn't scale, just as stated in the twitter post that started the discussion. Take a `utils` lib in your project as an example. It is used almost everywhere and disturbs the relevant project structure when shown visually.\nIn my opinion, the crucial point is focus and abstraction. I believe that visually showing \"the bigger picture\" can really help understand a project, especially when it's large. It's just that you can't plot all relationships between all parts on a 2D canvas and expect people to understand it. That's also not what programmers using textual PLs have in mind when they think about the system. It's ok to hide some details in order communicate the higher-level dependencies.\n\nAnother important part is perspective. For code I've written, I have a pretty good mental model and probably don't need to actually see the structure on screen. If I need to understand someone else's project (or my projects from 3 years ago), it's really beneficial to have that overview available. This social issue is probably more important than the technical ones. Experienced programmers and people who mostly work on the projects they created don't benefit from VPL as much as beginners and people trying to understand existing stuff.\n\nI believe that the optimum is somewhere between textual PLs and current VPLs. Being able to choose between different views (see Projectional Editing) seems to make a lot of sense. Additionally, I'd like to see a system where users can specify which parts should be shown visually and which ones shouldn't be.

I'm not sure if this is a novel insight or not, but there seems to be some form of equivalence between reading\/writing code textually vs with blocks\/shapes and the equivalence of algebra\/geometry.\nThere are many proofs and problems that seem to lend themselves to geometry over algebra but there are also situations that being able to reason about something algebraically makes it substantially simpler. I think this is the situation where you need both and it's possible at certain levels of abstraction you would want to be able to easily shift back and forth. For example I could imagine a system that had components built in a textual representation but then the component linking all done utilizing shapes.",

If we started from the assumption that \"coding\" is about orchestrating groups of computers, what would we do differently? What does the UX for programming look like if you also have to specify where computations happen? It seems to make Bret Victor's problem much harder. But following Alan Kay, perhaps we don't yet have the \"hardest and most profound thing to then build every easier thing out of\".\n\nI'm also thinking about Dave Ackley's <https:\/\/movablefeastmachine.org>. He started out in security, so he likely knew all this when he started out on his project. You can't secure your computing substrate if you aren't thinking about 90% of the computers in it.\n\nAnyways, likely the fever dream will break in a day or two and I'll go back to ~lying to myself~ programming my little computer.

So I have dealt with these biases a lot, often in person and unfortunately in interviews. It's honestly a pretty rough ride being a professional visual programmer when 98% of your industry colleagues think your tool is a joke and not \"real\" programming.\n\nIf I respond here to the person's tweet, I believe they are asking the wrong questions. I don't think I would make an argument about visual programming necessarily being more \"concise and readable\", nor do I have a particular example that stands out as being one that would be readable in a visual programming environment and unreadable in a text-based one (for one, which language?). For one, I don't even know how you compare conciseness and readability. Those comparisons are ill-formed when comparing two text-based languages.\n\nThe context in which to discuss visual programming is that it is just as valid (no more valid or less valid) than text-based programming.

When I think of what language to use (beyond technicalities), I like to think in paradigms and which one is best suited to represent the problems I have.\n\nAdditionally, visual languages more readily provide live feedback, and so this is also where the argument gets lost, because visual programming tends to blur the line between program, the program running, and viewing the program in either of these states.

It's compiling all the time, running type propagation to let me know what's broken, allows me to (by default) debug a running program by touching the data, etc. Yes, you can do this in a text-based environment, but I think the visual environment invites this more and makes it easier.\n\nSo when I think of visual programming, I personally think of concurrency, dataflow, visual feedback, touching my program, etc.",

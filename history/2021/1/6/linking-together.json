My passion is software, not business. More importantly, it seems very clear that investors are rarely willing to invest in tooling, precisely because it is so hard to charge money for tools, and an ad-based model a la Google\/Facebook doesn't work on the command line (one npm package publisher tried it and he got smacked down hard and fast). So why should we lust after the old-fashioned charge-per-copy model again?"

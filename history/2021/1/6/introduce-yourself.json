Over the years I've become increasingly frustrated with the (continually worsening) complexity and poor productivity of the tools we use to write such applications, so I decided to do something about it.\nFor the last year, I've been working on a side-project called 'zero' - a programming language (and tool-chain) to let me write efficient, compiled, type-checked code that runs on the CPU and GPU, distributes across clusters naturally, but also gives me a proper live-coding workflow. Not a big ask, obviously :sweat_smile:\nI've got to the stage where I finally have a reference interpreter that lets me experiment with language ideas and workflows, and I'm about to start work on the full-on compiler. I'm in the fortunate position of being able shortly to transition to working on the language full-time, with a target of starting a new company in early 2022.\nSince I have an engineering rather than an academic background, I have a lot of learning to do - I definitely need some mentorship, guidance, critique, encouragement and moral support. Hopefully I can also be of some use to others as well !",

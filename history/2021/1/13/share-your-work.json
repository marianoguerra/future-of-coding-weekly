But I'm biased - I've thought RDBMSs sucked for maybe 15 years or so. It sounds like this kind of DB will automatically optimize itself by automatically noticing when it would be useful to have a particular kind of index... or something?\n\nDatalog has 5-tuples (entity, attribute, value, transaction_id, delete_flag). What is the id in [id, entity, attribute, value] and why is this used instead of the last two items in that tuple?\n\nYou said that \"a list of id-entity-attribute-value tuples is enough to model any data.\" No doubt you could; it doesn't follow that you should though. In his talk Norbert Wojtowicz mentioned that there were cases when he wouldn't use Datalog for something.\n\nWhen I looked at your code:\n```identifier(0) : Attribute {\n  Attribute.value-type = String\n  comment = \"...\"\n}```\nI thought to myself, as I usually do, that this was similar to <http:\/\/loyc.net\/les\/|LES>. Have you heard of it? I'm just starting to ask people this question: (1) have your heard of LES or Loyc trees and (2) if you had heard about them, would you have considered using them (e.g. to make prototyping easier, or to separate the syntax of your language from its semantics)? Why or why not?",

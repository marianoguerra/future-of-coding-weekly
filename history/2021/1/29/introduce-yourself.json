I do feel the primary challenge is in deciding what is specified via textual-based input and what is specified via visual-based input and deciding how one transitions from one to the other and back, if at all. One technical challenge in that is visual layout, for either text or visual nodes, and I think that in any case, _automatic_ layout is paramount. Even in text-based languages, I enjoy Lisps and Schemes because the structure yields easy automatic layout and formatting. However, the problem is not easy.\n\nSo I have a lot of work to do and mainly a lot of learning. I'm trying to learn more programming language design and implementation and I need to dive into graph data structures and algorithms (I do not have a computer science background).\n\nAnother thing I am doing is just building prototypes, and a major challenge in that was choosing a cross-platform GUI language. I really wanted to use F#, but landed on using Racket and its GUI toolkit. I've thought about the distraction of building my on GUI toolkit in F# using Skia because even now I still feel there's no good solution, in any language, for clean and simple development of desktop apps. F# is just so easy to build software that is understandable and works, but Racket's language making capability may come in handy.\n\nRight now, I'm mainly working on prototypes in Racket. My goal is to build a visual language for 2D graphics and animation, similar to Pure Data, vvvv, TouchDesigner, and Processing. I plan to use it to learn the GUI framework and experiment with ideas while constraining the end goal to 2D graphics. After that, I hopefully will have learned enough and will have libraries built up to start working on more general programming environments.",

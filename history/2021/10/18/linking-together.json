Users tag their data with different words, and this creates different collections, one for each word.  Search allows retrieving all the annotated instances in each collection no matter where they are located. Generating this same interaction by code by the user would be a very complex development, but annotations create a language to obtain that effect by leveraging a pre-programmed system that hides all the complexity.\n\nAs <@UMV4B97GT>'s example shows, they can also be used for collaborative work. An annotation is accessible from multiple remote points and can be edited with different tools with conceptually simple semantics. I think an annotation style of programming may be used for other use cases such as data transformations and data pipeline creation, as an automation mechanism that retains this kind of simplicity for end users.

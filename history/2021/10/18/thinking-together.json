Not even mentioning again Foursquare, Facebook and such, now we have very nice professional good-looking and easy to use CSS frameworks (many more than just Bootstrap) and templates. Filling them with your actual content is a breathe and you instantly get great-looking \"Web site\".\nEven vanilla CSS3 and JS7 are so _much_ nicer than what we had in 1996.\n\nRegarding \"Web sites\" in the sense of \"Web applications\"... What we can and do now wasn't even possible in 1996 so I don't even know how to compare...\n\nI suspect the original tweet was (secretly) referring to Webpack, Babel and other pretty crazy tools to process JS and stuff which you didn't have and didn't need in 1996. But the funny thing is... you still don't need them to build Web apps in 2021 that weren't even possible in 1996. Yep, even using modern frameworks, JS and CDN. Babel\/Webpack\/whatever are just *not* required. :slightly_smiling_face:",

But the funny thing is... you still don't need them to build Web apps in 2021 that weren't even possible in 1996. Yep, even using modern frameworks, JS and CDN. Babel\/Webpack\/whatever are just "

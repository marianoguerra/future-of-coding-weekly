Some constraint programming libraries like <https:\/\/github.com\/pothitos\/naxos|naxos> or <https:\/\/choco-solver.org\/|Choco-solver> integrate with imperative coding, and you can use them as a kind of oracle which you feed data into and from which you get lists of successful results. I find them somehow awkward though, sometimes it feels like you need to work with two isolated models of the domain problem, one in the classical environment and one inside the solver.\n\nConceptually I find it a bit simpler (still not _easy_, though) to use <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Constraint_logic_programming|constraint logic programming>, i.e. prolog-like environments where you program through generate-and-test subroutines but it internally keeps track of what values it can skip, for being incompatible with the current search space state.",

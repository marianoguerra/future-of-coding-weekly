Several research groups have grappled with the problem of characterizing and developing practical approaches for implementing adjustable autonomy and mixed-initiative interaction in deployed systems. However, each group takes a little different approach and uses variations of the same terminology in a somewhat different fashion. In this chapter, we will describe some common dimensions in an effort to better understand these important but ill-characterized topics. We are developing a formalism and implementation of these concepts as part of the KAoS framework in the context of our research on policy-governed autonomous systems.",

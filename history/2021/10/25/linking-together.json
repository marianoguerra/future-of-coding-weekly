For example, editors can be configured to look up documentation directly, as easily as your typical go-to-definition IDE experience (vim has this by default actually, and various language plugins provide the configuration to look up the docs in the appropriate location - the default is just opening up the `man` page for the token the cursor is currently on.)\n\nIt feels to me that it's going to be extremely difficult to provide enough context in comments for some things (a standard linux utility is a great example of this, where I may want to pull up the man page to review the various flags and their behavior, which is far too much for comment)",

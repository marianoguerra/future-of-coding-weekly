What I learnd there was quite eye opening and *my second revelation.*\n_The (german) course: <http:\/\/www.complang.tuwien.ac.at\/knoop\/fp185A03_ws2122.html> — by Jens Knoop — at TU Vienna_\n\nAt some point when I came across diagramming sofware (then I used yEd) I sketched out all of what I've learned so far. Thereby realizing …\n• (A) … how far even Haskell is still improvable. — *Revelation three.*\n• (B) … how much can be learned by high level diagramming and how awesome it would be if that would fall out of a programming language\nI was starting to desire autopropagarion of renaiming, automatic code substitutions, and more … Desiring structured editing — basically.\n\nMy *fourth revelation* was making the connection between John Tromps Lambda diagrams and textual code, leading to my work on \"Annotated Lambda Diagrams (ALDs)\".\n-- _<http:\/\/apm.bplaced.net\/w\/index.php?title=Annotated_lambda_diagram>_\nI found that translating existing ideas into these diagrams greatly helps me in understanding them. Which makes me think that this may be a good \"semitextual\" programming interface.\nNow I'm in the process of investigating ideas-and-work of some great people in the context of ALDs ( Looking at ideas from: Conal Elliott, Jonathan Edwards, Cryus Omar <http:\/\/et.al|et.al>. , Daniel P. Friedman, ... ) All this as spare time efforts.\n\nMy *fifth and so far final revelation* (during 2018) emergerd probably mostly from my frustration with nonexistence …\n• … of local-first selfhosting options.\n• … of personal local-first self-owned content curation assistents.\nI realized that in order for good novel technical solutions of core problems to thrive sociotechnical problems need to be solved in unison _(unison the word not unison the proglang here)_. Code just cannot be borderlessly shared if there are no well designed means that allow for judement of its trustworthyness.\nWhat I want to see eventually are distributed ledgers that:\n• do not insist on maximally global public consensus for everything and \n• are nonmonetary at their core.\nVery few projects aim for that. In fact I only know one so far.\n\n— — —\n\n*Regarding the \"future of coding\" side of my interests I'm into:* \n• denotative core language design\n• content adressed design (datastorage and versioning)\n• dependent typing \n• agent centric design (sociotechnical aspect)\n• and what I missed here ...\nMy core interest though is actually advanced atomically precise manufacturing (APM). Aimed at future gemstome-metamaterial-on-chip-factories. But if software does not get fixed I see a dark future ahead. Both for the path there and the eventual result.",

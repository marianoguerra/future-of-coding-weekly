In contrast, I was thinking of each symbol as a \"piece of syntax\" that helps identify which function to call.\n\nUnder your interpretation, `(fun1 fun2 var3)` is ambiguous, because it could be interpreted as passing the symbolic value \"fun2\" to the fun1 function, or as passing the symbolic value \"fun1\" to the fun2 function.\n\nUnder my interpretation, there is no function definition with the signature `(fun1 fun2 .)`, so you get a compile-time error.\n\nBut since starting this thread, I've actually been trending towards the first interpretation. It might turn out to be \"nicer\" in practice, especially as an alternative to passing strings around everywhere. But I think you'd now want\/need variable references to be distinguished from symbols, using the `&amp;` syntax as you mentioned, or even just the parentheses (after all, a variable reference is just a function call with zero arguments). So a function call would look like `fun1 (a) (b)` or `fun1 &amp;a &amp;b`. Though I've been thinking about a more lightweight syntax inspired by Rust's lifetime syntax: `fun1 'a 'b`.

When programming, I'm not sure I can clearly distinguish between \"using a modelling language to create a model\" and \"creating a new model definition language\". If we consider a programming language or system as a model definition language, any library or framework written in that system now is a new model definition language. It shares some aspect with the underlying language, but introduces new abstract concepts that can be instantiated to express a new kind of model. You don't even need a rich library for this. A trivial example is if I implement a Graph class in any OO language, and express various concepts in my programs as graphs, I've now created an ad-hoc modeling language where \"graphs\" can be expressed and processed.\n\nSo, in any final system that exhibits behavior, where is the boundary between creation of models vs creation of new modelling languages? Hard to tell. Is it possible that in other fields of science and engineering, we don't usually create model definition languages so easily? Maybe.\n\nI agree :100: on your original point that coding is not about data and functions. It's really about crafting systems via representations (~models). I'm not a fan of even the usual connotations of a program where you write it then run it.

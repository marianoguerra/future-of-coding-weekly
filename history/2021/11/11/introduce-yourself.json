        "text": "So excited to meet everyone here! I'm John, the founder and creator of the Primitive _Immersive Development Environment_. I started Primitive in 2015 because I wanted to create the IDE of the future. I believe the future of programming is collaborative, immersive, and powered by spatial computing and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Primitive IDE is my life's work. It is a collaborative 3D\/VR environment where users explore codebases to learn, review, and debug code in an unlimited environment. A few things that makes Primitive unique:\n• Primitive crawls GitHub and has a fully explorable mapping of the top repositories\n• Anybody can view their own code on their local machine and see a directory and file mapping in a 3D spatial layout\n• Programming files are parsed by a variety of tools (ANTLR, Roslyn, Clang, JavaC) to show their AST structure and to enable animated reference maps in the 3D space\n• For Java, Primitive can display multi-thread runtime traces and a memory graph in the 3D environment\n• There is also a backend that integrates with Bitbucket, GitHub, and GitLab and automatically analyzes your private repos to share with your team. This is great for code walkthroughs and onboarding\n• The backend does AST diffing in git, and will show you changes in the codebase as a 3D model. This is amazing for code review, because it's very easy to see what has changed in a PR\n• Finally, and most experimentally, we have a voice-controlled Codex implementation. This is the future that I'm most excited about: a team of people asking a machine to generate code, that gets displayed and tested in a 3D VR environment. Here is a demo: <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=icHLoxOFerk>\nI'm glad to have discussions about spatial computing and AI enabled programming. I just discovered this community and I'm excited to hear about what everyone is working on.\n\n<https:\/\/primitive.io\/>\n<https:\/\/twitter.com\/PrimitiveVR>",

These themes show up all the time in FoC contexts, but as far as I can tell they’re rarely the ROOT metaphors of a system.\n\nOf course there are plenty of examples in “real engineering,” what Alan Kay refers to as CAD&lt;-&gt;SIM-&gt;FAB system. Do you know of examples of ‘convivial computing’ projects where modeling and simulation are the main event, or readings on the topic? What do you think of this premise?\n\nHere’s a recent <https:\/\/www.quora.com\/Does-Alan-Kay-see-any-new-ideas-in-computing|Quora answer> for more context: *Does Alan Kay see any new ideas in computing?*\n&gt; “New” is not what I look for. “Ideas that make a qualitative difference over past techniques” are what I’d like to see.\n&gt; \n&gt; Years ago, I’m fairly sure I was aware of pretty much everything regarding computing that was going on in the world. Today, I’m definitely not aware of everything, so it’s reasonably likely that if there was something really great being done somewhere that I wouldn’t know about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would be most interested in learning about “qualitatively more expressive” programming that is more in line with top-level engineering practices of the CAD&lt;-&gt;SIM-&gt;FAB systems found in serious engineering of large complex systems in the physical worlds of civil, electrical, automotive, aeronautical, biological, etc. engineering.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the CAD&lt;-&gt;SIM part I’d like to see the designs understandable at the level of visualizable semantic requirements and specifications that can be automatically simulated (on supercomputers if necessary) in real-time, and then safely optimized in various ways for many targets.\n&gt; \n&gt; Isolating semantics in the CAD&lt;-&gt;SIM part implies that what is represented here is a felicitous combination of “compact and understandable”.\n&gt; \n&gt; The FAB-part pragmatics are very interesting in their own right, and besides efficiencies, should be able to deal with enormous scaling and various kinds of latencies and errors, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; The above would be the minimal visions and goals that I think systems designers within computing and software engineering should be aiming for.\n&gt; \n&gt; I’m not aware of something like this being worked on at present, but these days this could be just because I haven’t come across it.",

Today, I’m definitely not aware of everything, so it’s reasonably likely that if there was something really great being done somewhere that I wouldn’t know about it.\n\nI would be most interested in learning about “qualitatively more expressive” programming that is more in line with top-level engineering practices of the CAD<->SIM->FAB systems found in serious engineering of large complex systems in the physical worlds of civil, electrical, automotive, aeronautical, biological, etc. engineering.\n\nIn the CAD<->SIM part I’d like to see the designs understandable at the level of visualizable semantic requirements and specifications that can be automatically simulated (on supercomputers if necessary) in real-time, and then safely optimized in various ways for many targets.\n\nIsolating semantics in the CAD<->SIM part implies that what is represented here is a felicitous combination of “compact and understandable”.\n\nThe FAB-part pragmatics are very interesting in their own right, and besides efficiencies, should be able to deal with enormous scaling and various kinds of latencies and errors, etc.\n\nThe above would be the minimal visions and goals that I think systems designers within computing and software engineering should be aiming for.\n\nI’m not aware of something like this being worked on at present, but these days this could be just because I haven’t come across it."

I guess I still see those tools in the CAD\/SIM\/FAB camp, at least Simulink and yakindu, though I prob need to make another category for “business processes” (which I still don't think the UML family has done a great job solving). For me 'convivial computing’ intends something I might use to build\/edit my own tools (notes, todos, etc) in a live environment."

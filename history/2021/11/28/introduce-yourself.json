I was recommended the podcast a couple years back, and have enjoyed several episodes a lot.\n\nMore recently, I was recommended to check out the slack in conversation with <@U01A0KANUUU> and <@U02JDAYKW7J> (thanks for the recommendation :slightly_smiling_face:).\n\nMy principle interests for the last while have been:\n\n• Philosophy of communication and community\n• PLT, especially in relation to the above, and in relation to philosophy of logic and logical foundations, and with a soft spot for logic programming. The kinds of transformation in programming I'm keen on go in hand-in-hand with fundamental insights into logic, ontology, and communication (as the medium of community).\n• Cooperativism, the social and solidarity economy, and (left) utopian political prefiguration more generally\nThat said, my activities are often not much beyond dabbling in this or that.\nOutside of work, most of my programming is the OCaml ecosystem.\n\nHappy to be here and I look forward to learning from the conversations.",

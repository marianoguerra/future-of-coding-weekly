        "text": "<@UBSMEUXAA> I really liked your comments yesterday, but your example today of Google's style guide has always felt to me like a case where formalization is misplaced. It's just so focused on nitty-gritty. I really got radicalized against style guides by my time at Google, where I consistently found engineers falling into two traps:\n• Assuming that code was well-architected just because it satisfied the style guide. Style guides were meant to focus code review. In practice they provided cover for rubber-stamping. They also short-circuited critical thinking. (How could my code possibly be good, if it violated the style guide?)\n• More subtly, thinking of code as an asset rather than a liability, so that it felt better to have more of it.\nOf course, Google has more fundamental issues of incentives, so it's hard to blame the style guide too much. Perhaps it was just the sharp end of the spear for many of my worst interactions. I'll just suggest that style guides become counter-productive when they outlive their creators. We were living in a world of received wisdom without the means to change it. That sense of disempowerment is far more important than any benefits in consistent code style.\n\nBringing it back to my original point, these recommendations are highly situational. I find it impossible to recommend practices in all situations. All I can do is recommend you minimize scale. Because then at least you have a chance at a coherent good\/bad evaluation for everyone in a specific situation.",

I’ll start here with the meta point and get back to the code\/comment standards more directly in a second.\n\n\n&gt; This can come from top down, of course, but it can also come bottom up from individual members of the team.  Large company wide coding standards should still accept feedback from individual ICs that bring up issues, and for things that are under-defined individual teams can define them for their codebase or use case if necessary...

It has not been the case that leadership forced formal processes that didn’t work. They were all ICs who made these standards. But typically they were more senior engineers\/architects. I’d imagine that is fairly standard.\n\nAnd it might sound crazy, but I think these are major problem. First, power isn’t about leadership or non-leadership. People can have power over you without being above you. The people who put these coding standards in place are deciding how you ought to work. Perhaps they are right, this standard is good, or at least good enough. But what does that matter?\n\nWhat problem are we trying to solve by forcing people to cohere to a certain standard? Are we trying to, stop that person who leaves rants in code? Are we trying to stop the annoying code reviewer who nitpicks every little thing? If so, those are great goals with a bad fix.\n\nChanging the rules isn’t fixing the problem. Those people still have those bad beliefs that cause them to want to have that behavior. If there is someone leaving rants in code that are disrespectful, shouldn’t some one talk to them?\n\nT.S. Eliot wrote some very poignant lines about this about people who\n\n\n&gt; constantly try to escape\n&gt; From the darkness outside and within\n&gt; By dreaming of systems so perfect that no one will need to be good.\nWe do precisely this constantly. Make system so that people don’t have to be virtuous. People don’t have to have informed opinions, they just have to follow the rules.\n\nI think this impulse is one of the ways we have stopped engineers from thinking. It is one of the ways we prevent people from taking rational approaches to their opinions on things like commenting. (And by rational, I mean a process that involves reasons, not that the outcome is correct. You can be rational while being completely wrong and vice versa.)\n\nQuickly skimming the c++ style guide you linked, it seems like a sensible set of advice. Nothing too objectionable there. If a team of peers wants to say, “we are going to try to follow this”, great! But what I see lacking there is why. For example:\n\n&gt; Function comments should be written with an implied subject of This function and should start with the verb phrase; for example, “Opens the file”, rather than “Open the file”. \nI can imagine reasons why you might want to make this a rule. Let’s say you are making comments for some sdk to be used by the public, that seems like a sensible bit of consistency you might care about. But this style guide is completely void of that context, it gives no reason why at all.\n\n\nSo, to summarize. I have no problem with linters. I have no problem with style guides. I have no problem with documenting code. I have trouble with imposition. It is more important to me that people come to considered, rational opinions. Imposition does not produce that.\n\nTo highlight this, let me get back to the main topic more directly.\n\n&gt; if one person is following a good practice, but the rest of the team isn’t, shouldn’t that be shared and adopted across the team\nYes. It should definitely be adopted, but only if the team is convinced. Only if the team believes that this is the better way forward. Even if it is a fact that this practice is good, just adopting it by fiat does not accomplish my goals.\n\nSidenote: I do like the commit message style of expressive documentation. I do that myself quite often. Even if I don’t know that people see it or not, it has helped clarify things for myself, even has helped me discover bugs.\n\n\nI’ll take a guess as to what the disagreement is here. I don’t think we’d actually disagree much in practice when it came time for code review. I’m not for long ranting comments. I’m not for nitpicking things. I try to stick with the standard formatting and styles of a community (depends on the language and code base). I agree that code review should transcend style and should “focus on architecture and the problem the code is solving”.\n\nWhat I think we are disagreeing on is he end goal. I really don’t care about productivity. I don’t care about efficiency. I don’t care about consistency.\n\nI care that programmers are getting to express themselves. That they are learning. That they are thinking through things. That they are building things that aren’t a pain for others. That they aren’t imposing on others. That they are grounded in the concrete situation of the codebase, the system, and the world around them. That they are building a theory (see Peter Naur’s Programming as Theory Building).\n\nThese imposition of things like comment and coding style are admittedly small things. They are not a hill I die on. But to me the are emblematic of these larger issues.",

It is one of the ways we prevent people from taking rational approaches to their opinions on things like commenting. (And by rational, I mean a process that involves reasons, not that the outcome is correct. You can be rational while being completely wrong and vice versa.)\n\nQuickly skimming the c++ style guide you linked, it seems like a sensible set of advice. Nothing too objectionable there. If a team of peers wants to say, “we are going to try to follow this”, great! But what I see lacking there is why. For example:\n\n"

Even if it is a fact that this practice is good, just adopting it by fiat does not accomplish my goals.\n\nSidenote: I do like the commit message style of expressive documentation. I do that myself quite often. Even if I don’t know that people see it or not, it has helped clarify things for myself, even has helped me discover bugs.\n\n\nI’ll take a guess as to what the disagreement is here. I don’t think we’d actually disagree much in practice when it came time for code review. I’m not for long ranting comments. I’m not for nitpicking things. I try to stick with the standard formatting and styles of a community (depends on the language and code base). I agree that code review should transcend style and should “focus on architecture and the problem the code is solving”.\n\nWhat I think we are disagreeing on is he end goal. I really don’t care about productivity. I don’t care about efficiency. I don’t care about consistency.\n\nI care that programmers are getting to express themselves. That they are learning. That they are thinking through things. That they are building things that aren’t a pain for others. That they aren’t imposing on others. That they are grounded in the concrete situation of the codebase, the system, and the world around them. That they are building a theory (see Peter Naur’s Programming as Theory Building).\n\nThese imposition of things like comment and coding style are admittedly small things. They are not a hill I die on. But to me the are emblematic of these larger issues."

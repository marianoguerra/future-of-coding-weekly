I really like both of your thoughts about a neural net for ASTs as opposed to basing the model on something like GPT-3. I agree also about the need for a tight feedback loop between humans and machine - I really wanted to see this in VR, which is how the voice-controlled prototype came about. There has been a \"typing\" issue in VR, and I think voice can resolve this if it's also paired with something like Codex.\n\nIf you or anyone would be open to a VR hangout, I'd love to discuss this further.",

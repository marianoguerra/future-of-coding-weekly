I feel like this would actually be a pretty useful way to get rapid top-down understanding of a piece of code, though it is hard to tell without actually working with it (I see what you mean about the squinting issue, but there may be ways to mitigate it. Also, it would only display in this style in an \"overview\" mode or something and an editor could let you rapidly switch between that and normal view. I think once you're ready to start e.g. editing a particular function you may not want the varying sizes).\n\nAs far as navigation however, I think the hierarchy from Tiled Text style control just requires too many inputs—at least on desktop. (I think the tradeoff potentially works on e.g. mobile or VR where you can't be as precise, so it's okay to make up for it with additional keypresses to navigate hierarchy (as opposed to painfully attempting to place your cursor between specific characters with e.g. hand-tracking))\n\nI definitely need to take more of the quick and dirty prototype approach in the future—it's very cool to be able to more concretely examine some of these ideas over such a short space of time. Also interesting how little bits of missing context can still make it difficult to evaluate though..",

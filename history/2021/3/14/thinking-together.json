I have problems with more than just the implementation of their model: the very model itself demands language users to construct \"networks of machines\" (propagators), which I find unsalvageable. Why should a program consist of \"cells\"? They don't map clearly to human reasoning and logic. I'll assert the following: humans don't naturally describe _*goals*_ (N.B: I'm not talking about steps\/strategies) within a searching or measuring task (a computation) in terms of storing and retrieving information from abstract \"cells\" of knowledge; instead we describe the factors\/quantities in our domain, and the relationships\/constraints between them (including iterative\/recursive relationships). Propagators seem to be adding arbitrary hoops and hurdles on top of that, by asking us to think in terms of machines and memories.",

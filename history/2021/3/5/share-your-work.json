Like many people here, I've been enthusiastic about the potential of \"structured editors\" for a long time, but I had not heard about Dion specifically until now, and it seems to be more active and further along than other projects I've heard of in that category. The video gave me lots of thoughts - about the cool animated caret, the tabs vs spaces, the zooming, and the unsolved challenges mentioned towards the end. Guess I should reach out to the team with my feedback!",

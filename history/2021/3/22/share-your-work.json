It always seemed like an obvious idea, so I wondered why no one had implemented it yet - guess I just didn't look hard enough. But the devil is in the details. I can understand why you'd find my \"stretchy\" demos disorienting - everything is shifting at the same time, nothing is stable... By changing text opacity, do you mean changing _both_ font size _and_ opacity together, so that small text = low opacity? Or something else?\n\nI also think code folding feels underused, and I've thought a bit about why. First of all, I think we can divide code folding into 2 subcategories. One is the general \"zoom out\" type of view in makepad.dev or the start screen in my tiled_text_take1. It seems good and unproblematic. The other category is when the user manually chooses which code sections to fold. It's a different use case. For example, if I have a long file with the functions A, B, C and D in that order, and now I want to read A and D, but I currently don't care about B and C in between so I fold them. One problem I have is the amount of work required to fold them. I either have to move my caret to the correct row and hit some awkward keyboard command, or I have to use the mouse and hit a tiny icon. In the <https:\/\/media.handmade-seattle.com\/dion-systems\/|Dion project>, they solve this use case with \"slices\" instead - one writes a small piece of special code which simply lists which functions one wants to see. Everything else is hidden while viewing the slice. But I feel like this is even more work than folding by mouse click. But the main problem I have with code folding in current editors is that the hidden block becomes _too_ hidden. We get absolutely no clue about how large it is or what it does. The \"thumbnail\" idea would hint at the block size, while the \"function signature\" idea in my <https:\/\/youtu.be\/wdf6S6oumH8|5th video> would hint at what the block does from an input-output perspective.\n\nThanks for sharing your links. Indeed, there's lots of overlap between our work! :grinning: The differences are worth thinking more about, too.... This deserves a longer reply. I'll be back!",

I’m working on making a new environment for music composition that includes computation and expressive transformation as a first class citizen, to replace the extremely static and usually frustratingly inexpressive world of MIDI-based DAWs and traditional notation editors. Looking forward to expanding my horizons and learning from what others are attempting in similar areas. Nice to meet you!",

Take a look at this image. The problem with using it for the carousel is that you have to move parts to and from a background layer during use, instead of only when editing the machine. I have never done something like that but I'm sure it's possible. The scripting system has full access to the whole program, it would be relatively easy to create a library part that can change the layer of a part depending on where it is for instance (So only the front display is in the visible layer, when it rotates it is moved to a background layer)",

I think a lot about the constraint in games to maintain interactive speed, to make sure the code can robustly handle a cascade of quick successive inputs. It pains me to see professionals like for example store clerks or doctors, who use the same computer programs every day, when they're forced to work with slow programs. For example I often see them experience unpredictable delays after some keypresses, and some inputs may be lost, or queued up and applied later in the wrong context. Such bad systems prevent them from ever reaching that level of subconscious fluency.\n\n&gt; ... so I didn't get the interesting \"zoomed out map\" kind of effect shown in your demo.\nWell, let's try it! Here's a <https:\/\/emilprogviz.com\/stretchy-code-map\/tiled_text_take1.html|quick&amp;dirty mockup> of what I had in mind and tried to describe in my previous comment. (I hope I don't come off as if I'm on some crusade to try to convince you to resume work on a nightmare jumble of 10 year old java - I just find it interesting to discuss the design, and who knows what else this might inspire!)\n\nAnd then I thought of a possible disadvantage with the whole stretchy-map idea: it might become tempting for the user to try to read the really tiny text, by squinting and leaning forward. In that case, this layout might contribute to headaches and bad posture. Hard to tell from playing with a \"lorem ipsum\" prototype for 10 sec.\n\n&gt; ... impractical for me to finish it on my own in random bits of free time\nI see. It's hard indeed to work on projects over a certain size in one's spare time. I'm in an amazing position for my side projects right now thanks to Sweden's generous Covid crisis support package, but even 12 months of part-time leave isn't enough for half the things I'd like to do. Anyway, wish I was rich enough to fund you! The world needs a tool like Lucidity, they just don't know it yet. Thumbs up for considering open sourcing it, even in an unfinished state.",

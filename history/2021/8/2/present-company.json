The company I work for, Ginkgo Bioworks (<http://ginkgobioworks.com|ginkgobioworks.com>), is currently looking for software engineers, data engineers, automation engineers, and many other positions! I'm going to try my best not to sounds like a spammy recruiter here, but I've personally been a long term geek on the future of programming related things, and I can honestly say that this is one of the most exciting places I've ever worked!\n\nSo why am I posting about a synthetic biology company in the Future of Coding slack? Because at Ginkgo, our mission is to \"Make Biology Easier To Engineer\", and for us that means developing new tools and techniques to allow people to someday program cells the same way computers are programmed today. But instead of programming a computer to process data, we are programming cells to produce physical goods. Everything from living medicines, to food, to fragrances, and a million other things as well. Obviously an ambitious goal, but there is plenty of exciting work to be done, and we are looking for good software, automation and UX folks to help, even if they don't necessarily have a biology background.\n\nFor example, I came from a robotics background, and am learning a lot of the biology side myself! I'm currently working on a platform for large scale automation of lab experiments, including exploring new ways of \"biological intent declaration, e.g. investigating DSL's for turning a biologists lab protocol into instructions that run in our robotics labs! We also have teams building graphical tools for designing genes, teams working on data pipelines and ML, teams building databases and tools to organize all of our knowledge of cell engineering, etc....plus all sorts of other interesting stuff!\n\nAnd for the super computer language nerds (like myself!), you'll also be working at a company co-founded by Tom Knight. As in famous MIT Professor / Lisp Hacker Tom Knight, now known as the \"Godfather of Synthetic Biology\" :smile:\n\nPlease feel free to reach out to me if you are interested or want to ask any questions! I'll also try to post some interesting stuff in the :thread:shortly",

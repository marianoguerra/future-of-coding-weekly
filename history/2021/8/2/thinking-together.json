I understand it's not a standard approach, so it appears complicated. But in order to use my monitor effectively I still have to install GPU drivers (I understand that depending on your use case that might not be true). People often use coded language with VR to describe one thing, when they actually mean something else. So \"not plug in play\" could actually mean setup is easy, but the existing UX for interacting with traditional 2D applications is insufficient (which I agree with). This was my point that it's not just a monitor. In that sense even a monitor isn't just a monitor. You're working with decades of UX designed to make the monitor work and input systems designed to work with it.

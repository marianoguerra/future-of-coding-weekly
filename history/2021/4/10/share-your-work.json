Lots of template\/code generators exist that overemphasize ease of getting started, but end up delivering complex solutions when the app scales and people realize what they needed was better architecture, and not 2-days shaved off by skipping boilerplate. Software being hard *isn't* about mundane tasks like boilerplate, but rather our focus on easy solutions complecting together into something unmanageable.\n\nWhat are the semantics around the infrastructure abstraction you guys have in Gadget? Seems like a lot of thought was put into scalability with Kubernetes and Cloud Functions (curious about the use of both, was there a reason why it couldn't be all serverless, or all K8s?), but given the product hasn't launched yet it's not clear how infrastructure is actually handled (terraform templates generated by gadget? custom code serving as the main engine, and cloud functions being the primary user code?).

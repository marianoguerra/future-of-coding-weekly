The goal is to prove out some aspect before you feel fully invested in it. But sometimes for complex ideas even the most barebones prototype feels like a lot of work. And a static representation carries its own risk, of inconsistencies hidden in the static parts that you might not notice until you move on to the next step.\n\nLately my kids' favorite thing to have read to them is a book which describes Alberto Giacometti spending 10 years sculpting busts down to the size of a thumb, before switching to large sculptures that now go for $100M. I often wonder if that was an exercise in prototyping. 10 years seems not outlandish to spend in such a phase.\n\n<https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alberto_Giacometti>\n<https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Diego_Giacometti>\n<https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/en\/book\/show\/41090392-two-brothers-four-hands>",

But sometimes for complex ideas even the most barebones prototype feels like a lot of work. And a static representation carries its own risk, of inconsistencies hidden in the static parts that you might not notice until you move on to the next step.\n\nLately my kids' favorite thing to have read to them is a book which describes Alberto Giacometti spending 10 years sculpting busts down to the size of a thumb, before switching to large sculptures that now go for $100M. I often wonder if that was an exercise in prototyping. 10 years seems not outlandish to spend in such a phase.\n\n"

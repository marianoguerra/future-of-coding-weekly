(I'm sure you know this, and suspect you've read Agawu's _Representing African Music_.) It's interesting to me that while we teach using phonations like \"1 2 3 4\" \/ \"*1* and *2* and *3* and *4* and\" \/ \"*1*-e-and-uh *2*-e-and-uh\" \/ \"*1* trip-let *2* trip-let\", we don't carry those things forward to the degree that orally transmitted musical cultures do.\n\nIn any case, it does turn out to be worthwhile to _also_ have a written\/drawn notation for situations where direct instruction is not available, in which case one ends up with some form of \"paper music\" (or in your case \"screen music\") more-or-less by definition. Maybe ubiquitous video instruction will change this in the future? :man-shrugging::skin-tone-2:",

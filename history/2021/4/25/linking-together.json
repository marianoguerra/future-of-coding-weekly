It will absolutely involve some future of coding research, but perhaps not in a way that would be obviously recognisable.\nWe have a funded PhD role available to join our group, get in touch if you're interested and\/or please share the link: <https:\/\/www.lhi.is\/en\/intent-phd-scholarship>\nHere's a blurb about the new lab (more soon): <http:\/\/www.sonicwriting.org\/blog\/intent>\nAnd here's a link to the PI's book about music technology which I have to say is rather good: <https:\/\/www.bloomsbury.com\/uk\/sonic-writing-9781501313868\/>",

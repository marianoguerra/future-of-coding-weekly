I'm not sure if a mathland for calculus absolutely needs symbols, but formal reasoning is a necessity.\n\nBy blocks do you just mean these abstractions you can compose with each other?

Symbolic reasoning is awesome, but sometimes it has its shortcomings. A term I prefer is \"formal reasoning\". I'm not sure if a mathland for calculus absolutely needs symbols, but formal reasoning is a necessity.\n\nBy blocks do you just mean these abstractions you can compose with each other? Maybe you have a clearer idea how you could do this than me. On a gut level it seems possible, although I'm a bit puzzled then why we don't seem to have examples of work in this direction."

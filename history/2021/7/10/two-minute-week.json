You can wire up components, prototype, figure out, think, iterate. It\u2019s a tool for creating tools. I think the closest reference I\u2019ve looked at is _Fabrik_ (as seen in <@UC2A2ARPT>\u2019s <https://github.com/ivanreese/visual-programming-codex|Visual Programming Codex>).\n\nIt\u2019s tough to share all the potential things it can be used for in one short video. I\u2019ll try to refine it through more videos and writing in the next weeks. :slightly_smiling_face:\n\n*The video is uncommented. So here\u2019s a summary of noteworthy things:*\n\n\u2022 There are workspaces, blocks and wires. It\u2019s like nodes &amp; wires, but with strict layout and user interfaces in mind.\n\u2022 This doesn\u2019t try to replace code, but makes working with code easier.  \n\u2022 Programming (dealing with data and organizing chunks of code) can be done visually.\n\u2022 Copy &amp; Paste as first-class citizen \u2192 Code becomes tangible\n\u2022 By visualising and showing data, it reduces the mental overhead of keeping state and data in my head.\n\u2022 Wires are a tool, not a necessity (in theory, a workspace could have a single self-contained block and no wires at all)\n\u2022 Instead of  needing to wire up every input, blocks can define their own inputs through inspectors or by providing their own UI \u2013\u00a0some blocks allow both: external inputs and UI\n\u2022 Blocks can have high levels of abstraction (no need to create blocks to do something easy like `a+b`)\n\u2022 Wires can be hidden and the program still makes sense because there is always some layout, user interface, \u2026\n\u2022 Various mechanisms for abstraction (wire up something, then copy the resulting block elsewhere), collapse blocks to hide data/UI, combine low level blocks (many inputs) into larger blocks (few inputs)\n<https://vimeo.com/573378340|https://vimeo.com/573378340>",

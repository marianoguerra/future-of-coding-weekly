Fixing it will take us a few weeks.\n\nSo, we come to an idea to manually onboard users by building any data analytics / data-driven process automation for companies that they need (for free and with no additional license cost - our product is Open Source and Free on Desktop usage). Our product, Enso (<https://enso.org>) is really powerful - think of it like about Alteryx (<https://alteryx.com>, $500M ARR), but more interactive, with better visualisations, and worse onboarding.\n\n**I would be very, very thankful for any advice on how to find / reach out to companies who might benefit from using Enso and would allow us to grow the user base faster.

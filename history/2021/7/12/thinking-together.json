More broadly though: I think the thing that'd be required to make this work well is the same thing that'd be required to make regular old node-and-wire work well — a really, really polished UI. Now, it might be easier to do a really polished UI with something like tubes, since the concept might switch out some hard to solve problems (a visual rats nest) with some easier to solve problems (showing a subset of paths).\n\nNeat to think about.",

More broadly though: I think the thing that'd be required to make this work well is the same thing that'd be required to make regular old node-and-wire work well — a really, really polished UI. Now, it might be easier to do a really polished UI with something like tubes, since the concept might switch out some hard to solve problems (a visual rats nest) with some easier to solve problems (showing a subset of paths).\n\nNeat to think about."

The difference lies in the flexibility of organisation and arbitrary reordering.  In literate programming you define chunks that can be reused wherever you want, whether in docs or code. If observable provides a named block that can be referenced and embedded anywhere then it gets close. I would emphasise that this is production code, not just examples which blogs and notebooks are typically used for!  Personally I find literate programming for noting down 1. todo’s 2. bugs 3. bookmarks 4, design decisions and history 5. build commands 6. tests",

In literate programming you define chunks that can be reused wherever you want, whether in docs or code. If observable provides a named block that can be referenced and embedded anywhere then it gets close. I would emphasise that this is production code, not just examples which blogs and notebooks are typically used for!  Personally I find literate programming for noting down 1. todo’s 2. bugs 3. bookmarks 4, design decisions and history 5. build commands 6. tests"

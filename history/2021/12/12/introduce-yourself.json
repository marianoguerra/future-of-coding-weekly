Sorry for the length…\n\nI used to be very active here, but over some time I developed a kind of disillusionment with my own thinking. I could no longer connect the dots between much of the work being done and long-term aspirations. I became skeptical of our ability to express or communicate with each other around the systems we wish to build, design, or see emerge.\n\nThere’s a lot of deep discussion in this community that gets toward many major questions:\n- how can we make systems interoperable? what is interoperability?\n- in what ways could human-computer interfaces be different? How can we reason about interfaces?\n- how can we collapse the user-programmer divide? What would a dynamic medium look like?\n- what does it mean for computing to be truly participatory? What does participation and agency look like across scale and context?\n- What’s the difference between data, structure, behaviour? Are these all the same?\n- what are the limits of possibility derived from current theory and mathematics? With so many areas, where do we focus? (systems sciences, FLT, PL design, HCI, semiotics, knowledge representation, models of computation, etc)\n- many more\n\nThese big and often broad questions, lines of inquiry, and conclusions resemble a sort of theoretical-adjacent foundation for the work being done in this community. There’s also the opposite end: concrete, current, specific discussion that supports each others efforts and current projects.\n\nWith all these rich and amazing discussions, which so clearly have merit, I became even more disillusioned. Not only was I lacking the language to articulate my own goals and desires, but I also felt like existing knowledge was underutilised, with many amazing individuals unable to build on each others work, many contributions left unused. It began to feel like I was thinking in the wrong place, and trying to do the wrong things (for me, anyway).\n\nSo I ended up taking a year+ ‘pause’ with some key goals for myself:\n1. Become genuinely familiar with fields which address key, foundational problems, some key focuses for me were on:\n\ta. Complex &amp; dynamical systems, control systems &amp; cybernetics\n\tb. knowledge representation, information &amp; communication theory, linguistics &amp; FLT\n\tc. distributed systems &amp; governance\n\td. lots and lots of math!\n2. Seek out a versatile but robust frameworks for reasoning that are portable across the computing landscape while remaining grounded in the material world.\n3. Explore what a *theory of change* grounded in systems sciences looks like, as a component of future-oriented work.\n4. Be academically rigorous and move towards more long-term research-oriented work\n\nTo cut a long story a bit short, I did some much needed re-orientation, discovering some really cool stuff along the way which I’m excited to share, and I have never felt better. I had to let go of a *lot* of ideas I held quite dearly, most of which I haven’t mentioned here. I’m actually more hopeful about the future of computing than I ever have been, but I’ve shifted positions quite a lot along the way.\n\nI now also have a research job in this exact area — _knowledge interoperability in distributed socio-technical systems_\n\nI’m now very focused on understanding _representations_ and _representation systems_ — which are very under-theorised and often invisible to us, or left implicit. I’m hopeful we can develop common frameworks for understanding existing systems that also allow us to reason about entirely new systems. Lots of compelling work from knowledge representation and systems sciences here.\n\nI’ve never felt so excited about a research direction before, and it’s already churned up some super compelling stuff. I couldn’t cram any actual theory contributions into this message, but I hope my excitement is contagious!\n\nI’m glad to be back, y’all are fabulous. &lt;3",

        "text": "<@UCGAK10LS> right now the focus is on developing appropriate theoretical frameworks for reasoning about representations. This is the main focus for now because the research is (very informally) aiming to help us communicate with each other and ourselves. It aims to assist existing reasoning about digital systems and facilitate cross-domain interoperability. Less knowledge rediscovery, more reuse. By digital system I’m speaking quite generally (Slack, your desktop, filesystems, OSs, drop down menus, network infrastructure. These are all digital systems in this context)\n\nI’m referring to _representation in_ the _knowledge representation_ sense, not the concept in the arts, and also not the way in which someone like Bret Victor uses the term, which is less defined. Unlike most knowledge representation literature I’m coming from a systems science perspective, which quickly leads to a single notion of representation breaking down, and the ‘system’ part becoming more central, so I often use the term ‘representation systems’ to differentiate this systems-based understanding of representations from the KR one.\n\nLots of KR literature comes from logic systems so there’s a lot of work on specific encodings of logic. There’s not as much work on large scale KR systems with many coexisting representations.\n\nExamples of representation systems might include (digital\/plain) text, IPFS addressing, interchange formats, or a programming language. With digital text being nearly omnipresent.\n\nedit: this was still full of jargon, I’ll try and give you a better answer in the future.",

It aims to assist existing reasoning about digital systems and facilitate cross-domain interoperability. Less knowledge rediscovery, more reuse. By digital system I’m speaking quite generally (Slack, your desktop, filesystems, OSs, drop down menus, network infrastructure. These are all digital systems in this context)\n\nI’m referring to "

Unlike most knowledge representation literature I’m coming from a systems science perspective, which quickly leads to a single notion of representation breaking down, and the ‘system’ part becoming more central, so I often use the term ‘representation systems’ to differentiate this systems-based understanding of representations from the KR one.\n\nLots of KR literature comes from logic systems so there’s a lot of work on specific encodings of logic. There’s not as much work on large scale KR systems with many coexisting representations.\n\nExamples of representation systems might include (digital\/plain) text, IPFS addressing, interchange formats, or a programming language. With digital text being nearly omnipresent.\n\nedit: this was still full of jargon, I’ll try and give you a better answer in the future."

        "text": "<@U02E4DAQGSZ> Yes, I think HSM takes state machines in a great direction! I am pondering the following way to perceive orthogonality in HSM’s. Traditionally we would look at is as the typical concrete representation invites: `{ a: { b: { c: ... } }, d: ..., e: ...}` .  So I consider the idea that this is more concrete  than it need be philosophically. Here is an attack: Let’s define two operators: `&amp;` for combining values into and-states, and `:` for combining values into hierarchies. Then we write `a:b:c  &amp; d &amp; e` . Traditionally, the CS practitioner and programmer would ask for precedence rules or brackets to disambiguate the expression:\n `{(a:b:c), d, e}` or  `{a:(b:c) , d , e }` . Here is the point where an alternative orthogonal model might be possible and might be valuable from a language-design point-of-view: In stead of nesting we lay out the values in a two-dimensional grid, e.g. drawing the  `&amp;` relation horizontally, and the `:` vertically upwards. Then, a noteworthy thing can be observed: _The `a` value is now both an element in the and-state (horizontal relation) and the first element in the hierarchy (vertical relation)._ This is my criteria for detecting of orthogonality, as I meant it in the OP.\n\n_Wow thanks!, it was kind of cool to actually write it down._ \n\nFollow-up question: So, while this evidently is drawable; does it map well to cognition, implementation? Is it view-point in the eye of the beholder, or does it open up them HSM model for e.g. generalization\/deeper understanding?",

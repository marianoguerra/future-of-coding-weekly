No additional infra required. corrorally -&gt; libraries can be packaged as frontend and backend too\n2. The environment is 100% browser. No tools to install. No \"pip install\", no \"webpack\", no compiling. You can do it all from a chromebook or mobile device, for instance\n3. It takes about 40ms for code changes to become visible remotely. Compared to 2 mins for lambda. The inner development loop is supercharged. You can develop live in prod. The iteration speed is incredible, partly due to instant deploys, partly due to Observable hot code reloading No setup required, its like that out of the box.\n4. True production debugging using vanilla browser tools. No simulacrum of a debugger. It's just the normal debugger everyone already uses, which means other debugging technology can be layered on top without problems (e.g. time travel debugging <https:\/\/www.replay.io\/>)\nThis is built on Observablehq, so it gets all its FoC features. Literate programming, Commenting, 1-click forking, version control, Functional Reactive Programming env, partial recompilation etc. No need for Github or git, remember, this is 100% browser based, you get all this on any device that supports a web browser. You can fix and deploy things on your mobile phone.\n\nYou can manage a whole microservice, including technical documentation and project management, in a single page of web editable code. For instance, this twitter bot is hosted on webcode <https:\/\/observablehq.com\/@endpointservices\/twitter-bot>. This is a whole IndieAuth oauth server. (<https:\/\/observablehq.com\/@endpointservices\/auth>)",

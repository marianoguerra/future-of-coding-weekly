Let’s call such a combination a `layer`.  (Think of state  the `values` and embodiment as `rendering`\/`timers`\/`event-handlers` etc).\n\nHere’s the problem it is aimed for solving: State composes perfectly with state, embodiment composes perfectly with embodiment; but _when we mix state and embodiment, complexity explodes exponentially_; we can no more distinguish between them, no more extract and model the state explicitly, visualize it, generate tests based on it etc and for every new part or feature, technical debt is amassed and the complexity quickly skyrockets into levels that not even the most skilled designers and developers can handle.\n\nSo back to the really simple idea: Let’s keep it orthogonal; _let components be expressed in an orthogonal way, let’s composition propagate orthogonality._\n\nWhat follows from it? How can we model it; can we being to imagine a `Layer Machine` formalism? A `layer machine markup language`? Make an enlightening `run-time visualization`? Can we implement it, and in how many LOC?; can we use it to explore its PL usability factors along some cognitive dimensions? What new ideas can we form based on that experience?",

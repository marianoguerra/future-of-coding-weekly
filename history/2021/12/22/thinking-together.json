        "text": "I really like your “home cooking” analogy and frequently share a very similar one regarding cooking that I think goes one step further.\n\nThe issue with “home cooking” as a goal is that in relation to computing most people are consumers\/diners\/users and not programmers\/chefs. So it’s not that we need more programmers and home chefs, I think the problem is that the gap between a home chef and a restaurant owner is so massive and exists the same way in software.\n\nTo extrapolate, let’s consider an example:\n\nYou’re a talented home cook that has an awesome new dish that you have perfected and want to share with the world. Great! Now how can you actually do that? You basically have two main options:\n\n1. Publish your recipe online (equivalent to open-sourcing on Github)\nPros:\n- Free to distribute\n- Unlimited reach\nCons:\n- Your users have be a home-cooks themselves to consume the recipe\n- You don’t make any money\n\n2. Start your own restaurant and serve your dish to patrons (equivalent to creating your own SaaS startup)\nPros:\n- You actually make money\n- Your users can be anyone (no cooking required)\nCons:\n- Extremely costly and risky to pursue\n- Requires *many* more skills and responsibilities to pursue (like hiring staff, renting a space, accepting credit cards, supply chain optimizing, etc)\n- Limited initial scale (usually just one location to start)\n\nSo what if there was a third option...\n\nWhat if every person had their own personal chef that could make any recipe your request and shop for the required ingredients on your behalf...\n\nWe wouldn’t need to rely on restaurants to enjoy highly skilled culinary creations. This would be awesome but clearly unfeasible in this cooking example but is entirely feasible in the software space. If each person had their own personal server, we could build and share full stack apps (and monetize them!) without having to build VS-funded software services.\n\nI’m currently working on this project with the aim to allow us “home cooks” to build apps for each other without storing each others data but also make those easy to use for the people that just want to eat and not cook. We’re doing this by creating a space for general purpose personal cloud computing that developers can target and user can install with just one-click.",

So it’s not that we need more programmers and home chefs, I think the problem is that the gap between a home chef and a restaurant owner is so massive and exists the same way in software.\n\nTo extrapolate, let’s consider an example:\n\nYou’re a talented home cook that has an awesome new dish that you have perfected and want to share with the world. Great! Now how can you actually do that? You basically have two main options:\n\n1. Publish your recipe online (equivalent to open-sourcing on Github)\nPros:\n- Free to distribute\n- Unlimited reach\nCons:\n- Your users have be a home-cooks themselves to consume the recipe\n- You don’t make any money\n\n2. Start your own restaurant and serve your dish to patrons (equivalent to creating your own SaaS startup)\nPros:\n- You actually make money\n- Your users can be anyone (no cooking required)\nCons:\n- Extremely costly and risky to pursue\n- Requires *many* more skills and responsibilities to pursue (like hiring staff, renting a space, accepting credit cards, supply chain optimizing, etc)\n- Limited initial scale (usually just one location to start)\n\nSo what if there was a third option...\n\nWhat if every person had their own personal chef that could make any recipe your request and shop for the required ingredients on your behalf...\n\nWe wouldn’t need to rely on restaurants to enjoy highly skilled culinary creations. This would be awesome but clearly unfeasible in this cooking example but is entirely feasible in the software space. If each person had their own personal server, we could build and share full stack apps (and monetize them!) without having to build VS-funded software services.\n\nI’m currently working on this project with the aim to allow us “home cooks” to build apps for each other without storing each others data but also make those easy to use for the people that just want to eat and not cook. We’re doing this by creating a space for general purpose personal cloud computing that developers can target and user can install with just one-click."

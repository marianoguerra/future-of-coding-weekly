Now I am using mainly VS code which is another story.\n\nBut even if Emacs is very powerful as an extensible environment, I guess the language to use is a barrier, maybe we need a more accessible language. I use to program with elisp but I never feel comfortable with it.\n\nSo what I would like to have is an environment as extensible as Emacs but with an easier way to program, like with a visual programming environment.

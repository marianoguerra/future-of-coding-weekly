        "text": "Plain text is many things.. it may be useful to discuss the different aspects independently.\n\n1. Plain text as a storage encoding: In theory anything can be encoded as text (worst case you just base64 encode it) but I don't think it is useful to call such an object \"plain text\".\n2. Plain text as a UI: This is what I think we often mean when saying something is \"just text\". The UI consists of lines of characters. Often there are symbols and whitespace as special markers. Words and literals often mean something useful in the subject domain. We navigate this space with the cursor and probably many editor shortcuts.\n    a. Plain text diffs: This is an idea within text-as-UI. When comparing two objects, we compare the plain text representations. This means all encoding artifacts are diffed, whether useful or not (whitespace, order of lines, ...)\nI agree that you can always store stuff in plain text - even if you want to represent a graph with nodes, metadata, and links, you could figure out a JSON or XML encoding for it. However, if we're giving up #2 above, because all editing will be done via special projectional editors, how much value do we get in preserving #1? Sure you could check it into git and view the _line-by-line diffs_, but they would be meaningless, no? With some work the plain text encoding could be carefully crafted so the diffs are somewhat meaningful, but I feel this is a losing battle. Richer projections cannot be displayed by line diffing tools. Objects in the text file cannot be given identity (note many clever hacks such as patience-diff, that try and localize linear diffs to the correct _function definition_). So in the end the line diff might end up being less and less useful, perhaps even hold us back from implementing richer projections (\"oh that will ruin the line diff\")?",

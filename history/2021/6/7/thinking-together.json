Not quite the same domain, but adjacent.)\n\n&gt; But with Fibers, presumably one of your inputs just wouldn't change and you'd have stale data on that input, but not the other.\nMy initial thought is that this is probably _fine_. As in: it's not as good as _not_ hitting this bug, granted, but it's a bug that should be easy to avoid most of the time and easy to solve when it does come up. If you hit this bug, then when you notice it 15 functions later, you just rewind execution back until you see where the problem cropped up.\n\nThat was my initial thought. But my prevailing thought is... that I don't understand what you mean by this:\n\n&gt; One point (in my eyes) in favor of calling it a \"barrier\" rather than the concept of \"Fibers\"\nIs a barrier like the \"sync\" node in SpaceChem? Is it something else?\n\nI'd like to hear more about what you think I should do instead of fibers. I think you're onto something (*), but I don't understand it well enough, even after a day of reflecting on it.\n\n(* Fibers are a conflation of several things. They hold state, they help with coordination. There are a few other approaches I've considered that keep those things separate. So it's very likely that I'll find more ways to slice up these concepts by looking at how other domains, like chips, handle similar problems.)",

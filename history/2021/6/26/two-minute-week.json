I’ll take another look.\nIn my current node implementation (for the demos you've seen before), I have 2 distinct types of 'pin'\n• Simple data: (bool, int, double, etc.)  Currently these are always 'inputs'; but I don't technically have a limitation on them being outputs too.\n• Flow Data - a generic representation of data flowing around the graph.  \nFlow data is effectively vectors of simple data types.  For example, 2 audio waves would be represented as:\n    ◦ [float, float, float....]\n    ◦ [float, float, float...]\nIn my graph, this means that playing a 3-note chord on an input instrument (for the audio case), may well result in several types of flow data running around the graph, typically containing 3 arrays of data, each array being a single 'frame' of audio; say 512 samples.

Suppose it wants to take in 2 numbers and produce a result.  In my system, currently, that means that a node outputting a number must convert it to a 1-dimension flow data to output it.  Then the Adder node can read the flow data and extract the number.  This means that you could effectively add 2 arrays of numbers in one compute step in the adder; or multiple entries.  You could also, in theory route 2 seperate flow sources to the same target and multiplex them on arrival.\n\nBut I'm still thinking about if it is appropriate to enforce this transform of scalar values to flow data when outputting from a node, and how this feels to the user.  There is a certain uniformity I like if all data flowing through the graph is represented the same way; but then what if you output from a node 3 streams of numbers in the flow data, but the user hooks that up to a single input number in a node.

Like a programming language, it's a tool that you have to learn to some degree before you can see how it can be useful for you. And the difference to a popular PL such as Python is that people start learning Python because it has the _reputation_ of being useful. Wolfram Alpha has no reputation at all with most people, it's an unknown.",

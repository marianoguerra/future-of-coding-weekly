Machine code programming on a modern Intel based motherboard happens at an abstraction level far above the bedrock, and below you are many dark corners and mysterious voodoo-encouraging subtle malfunctions. The UEFI is stealing cycles from the OS to do who knows what, the firmware for the microcode and the mysterious intel management engine are encrypted, and security flaws like Spectre and Meltdown require intelligent intervention at a level that is inaccessible to the owner of the computer. I think the author agrees with this.\n\nI don't agree that the invention of compilers in the 1950's was a mistake. Twenty years later, in the 1970's, CPU instruction set architectures were still being designed with the needs of assembly language programmers in mind. A key design goal was \"orthogonality\" &lt;<https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Orthogonal_instruction_set>&gt;. The existence of compilers didn't prevent architectures like the PDP-11 from being designed. I think the author agrees, since they mention RISC as the beginning of \"braindead architectures\".\n\nBut RISC wasn't primarily about compilers, it was primarily about making CPUs faster and more efficient, and prioritizing that goal above the goal of making the ISA comfortable for assembly programmers.\n\nSo here's my question. Suppose we start over, and build a new computer architecture from scratch. Is there not a fundamental tradeoff between making the new system as fast as an Apple M1, vs providing a bedrock abstraction level that is both accessible to the programmer, and habitable?",

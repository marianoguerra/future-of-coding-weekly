Its object system resembles CLOS (and not by accident) but slimmed down as well. It has a sizeable standard library but apparently no package system, which I find particularly refreshing given how much of a pain package systems have become. It looks like publishing Factor code comes down to proposing a pull request to the standard library. Which obviously doesn't scale, but then it doesn't have to. Factor looks very much like a \"small is beautiful\" language.\n\nIf anyone else is tempted to explore Factor, there's a tutorial at <https:\/\/andreaferretti.github.io\/factor-tutorial\/> that I found helpful because it doesn't get stuck at beginners' topic but aims at an overview of the whole system.",

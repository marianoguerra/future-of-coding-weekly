I want to make this more generic in the near future so that you can send custom property-bags \"over the wire\" to other nodes).\n\nThe timeline slider doesn't work together nicely with the slider node-type yet, so I have to work on that further.\n\nThis example can be found on <https://demo.codeflowcanvas.io> in the \"examples\" drop down: \"Simple state machine with image and brightness\".

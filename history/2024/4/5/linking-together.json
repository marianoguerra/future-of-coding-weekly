Some of the talks are about editor tooling (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kgXBifWQXI&t=5591s|like this one>, about the dev tooling used for the game A Monster's Expedition), which feels roughly relevant to this community. But there's one talk in particular that I _must_ draw your attention to because this is the internet and I need to earn points. The talk is called \"<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kgXBifWQXI&t=12992s|Rewinding: moving time backwards in planning-based games>\". The first example they use of a game that ought to have rewind but doesn't is Opus Magnum, a game by Zachtronics that is the spiritual successor to SpaceChem. I'd argue that both of these games are visual programming environments, and that this talk is basically an argument that visual programming deserves the ability to rewind time.",

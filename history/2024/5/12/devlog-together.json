When a node is selected, compatible node-types are shown in a dropdown. This helps especially when doing more creative work when creating a shader/gl flow for example and getting more feeling on what the impact is of certain mathematical operations (in the video <https://youtu.be/K-956F6Vwps> I change a multiply node to an arctan calculation).\n\nAnother improvement is being able to insert a node into an existing connection.. also taking compatibility into account. This speeds up the creation process of flows in general.\n\nUnder the hood I've also made a nice improvement: I can now use jsx components using vanilla DOM without the use of react or other libraries. This is a nice DX improvement when developing my project.",

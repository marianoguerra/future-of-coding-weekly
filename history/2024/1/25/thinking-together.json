I was aware of perhaps half of the systems in your list, so I have a good excuse for the other half: ignorance.\n\nMy main reason for not using any of these for most of my coding is weak (or absent) ecosystem support for my application domains, plus past investment into other ecosystems.\n\nA special mention goes to the Wolfram language, which would be a great fit for much that I do but which I do not use at all because of its proprietary nature. Even if I were personally willing to spend the roughly 1000\u20ac/year they charge for academics, I would seriously limit my collaborations if I expected my collaborators to do the same."

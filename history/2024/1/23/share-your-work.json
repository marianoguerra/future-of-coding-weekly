I don't know much about this subject, so my only reaction is, what do you think of transclusion?\n\nThe hyperlink works in a standardized context: the web browser's notion of a DOM tree. And classic hyperlinks implicitly replace the entire DOM when you click on a link. However this is a poor fit for VR; you have 10x more space, and probably 1/10x the situations where you want to replace the entire tree.\n\nOn the other extreme, consider (ha) a native app. What can happen when you click on some UI element? Anything is possible. The possibility space is a vast superset of links, at the cost of the standardization and interoperability that characterizes hyperlinks.\n\nOne way I tend to think about the space is in terms of the _target_. Hyperlinks have a reference to a payload and a target the payload is placed in. Html defaults the target to the whole tree, and you can also set the target to _blank to get a whole new tab/tree without losing the current one. And that's it.\n\nOne way to think about progressive web apps is as an app-specific map of possible targets.

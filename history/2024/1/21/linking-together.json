Although these tasks could, in theory, be automated in a spreadsheet using VBA or some such, in practice they are typically written down in natural language and followed manually the next time they need to be reproduced. \n\nI'm not criticizing spreadsheets. They are also an incredible historical success. I'm praising the power of Unix for some types of tasks.\n\nI wonder why so many graphical programming environments (Scratch, Snap!, Blockly, etc.) create graphical representations of algorithmic structures, like if statements and for loops, but not data flow pipelines...\n\nI wonder what a graphical version of Unix shell scripting would look like."

Normally, I write in Obsidian then I upload to github pages using gitkraken, but, this workflow offers too much resistance when I include drawings (I have to manually fixup refs to SVGs). Apple Pages is wildly more friendly than Obsidian, but, Apple Pages can only export to ePub and PDF and a bunch of other formats, none of which are markdown. I would like a one-button-push solution for publishing pamphlets (free or paywalled).  Should I consider creating an ePub and using Amazon (Kindle)? Or pushing an ePub to leanpub? Or fix my github workflow? Or use more than one workflow? Or ...?",

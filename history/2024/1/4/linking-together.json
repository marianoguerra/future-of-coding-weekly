In this course you will discover the joys of working with small, bespoke language models that you create, which in turn \u201cwrite\u201d procedurally-generated texts of all sorts. In the process we\u2019ll explore the long history of collaborating with computers to write poetry and narrative. By the end of the class, you\u2019ll be able to use HTML, Javascript, and Twine to generate texts of your own devising. You\u2019ll also get a handle on exactly why a humanist might want to play around with procedurally-generated texts or make their own. No programming experience is required. No experience is in fact preferred!",

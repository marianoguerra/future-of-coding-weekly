        "text": "Thanks for posting this. I can completely relate with where you are coming from and think this is something we need to do better at.\n\n\n&gt; The incentives right now are the same incentives we've defaulted to forever. Money. Money and power. Get paid to mentor, get paid to teach, get paid to {{X}}. It's not enough. It's old thinking. It has to go away. We humans need to understand sooner rather than later that empowering those are going to outlive you is the right thing to do - not the most profitable or selfly-gainful.\n&gt; I have ideas and hopes. They all rely on 'human empathy', which I just explained is often.. missing. I also understand I have a 'chip'. I personally feel this every minute of every day when I work-for-money or work-for-fun.\nI tried doing the paid mentor thing. When I did it, it was originally pitched to me as a company paying me to mentor a Junior engineer. Turns out, the junior people were often paying out of pocket.\n\nEven at the time, I told the company I was contracting through, I'd happily do it for free if the people I was \"mentoring\" were into programming. That was the real problem, no one I talked to actually cared about programming at all. Some had parents who had forced them to do it. Others I couldn't quite tell what the motivation was, perhaps the hopes of easy money?\n\nWhat I really wanted was not the money, but a filter. If you make an open call for being a mentor, sadly the kinds of people that often take you up on it are a bit much. I've offered in the past and had very strange conversations with people (seemingly messaging me when they are high).\n\nI want a filter not because I want self-gain, but because I want these conversations to be meaningful. It is hard to find people who are actually a good match. I will say, maybe future of coding is itself a filter? Not sure. If you (anyone not just OP) are reading this and think I could help you, happy to chat and explore that.\n\nInside a company is a bit easier. I've had a number of people that I've worked with in my career that I've helped level up. It's much easier there, because you can basically prescreen them. You can see how they work. You can figure out what level they are at. You can see if you get along as people. They can decide if they want to ask you questions as well. You also aren't taking time of the other obligations you have, this just is one of those obligations.\n\nI will say that I've pretty much always been on the mentoring someone else rather than being mentored side. I'm sure some of that is my fault. I am perhaps a bit over confident in my own skill and was especially so earlier in my career.\n\n\n&gt; where's the channel `#of-interns-and-newbies`, or `#of-young-tech-enthusiasts`? These are tighly coupled with the idea, yet we've still fallen victim to the idea of grouping up folks by ideas and geography - we instead have `#of-ai`, `#india`, `#in-atlanta`\nI'm open to the idea of those channels. I will say, I think <#C03RR0W5DGC|devlog-together> would be a good place to post about things you are working on and struggling with. I think one problem with newbie channels is that if no one answers, it can feel even worse. I remember posting in them before.  The more specific problem here is that there are too many different technologies people use, so you might not get an answer. Unless the goal is more just to meet other people at a similar stage of career or age as you. I definitely can relate to the lack of geography being meaningful to me. Fairly certain I'm the only one here from the Indianapolis area.\n\nFinally, on the meta use of llms, I think your original writeup with some editing was better than what ended up being posted here. The llmified version felt like I was jumping into a conversation that was already ongoing and I lacked context. For example: \"Generalizations about certain groups being \u201cunwilling\u201d to help are counterproductive\" seems like feedback you got from generalizing about groups, but in the context of the message you hadn't done that.\n\nI'd definitely recommend taking your original thoughts, cutting out a bunch and asking questions and expressing frustrations more directly. That's why I quoted from your original message, it was much more clear to me.",

I think one problem with newbie channels is that if no one answers, it can feel even worse. I remember posting in them before.  The more specific problem here is that there are too many different technologies people use, so you might not get an answer. Unless the goal is more just to meet other people at a similar stage of career or age as you. I definitely can relate to the lack of geography being meaningful to me. Fairly certain I'm the only one here from the Indianapolis area.\n\nFinally, on the meta use of llms, I think your original writeup with some editing was better than what ended up being posted here. The llmified version felt like I was jumping into a conversation that was already ongoing and I lacked context. For example: \"Generalizations about certain groups being \u201cunwilling\u201d to help are counterproductive\" seems like feedback you got from generalizing about groups, but in the context of the message you hadn't done that.\n\nI'd definitely recommend taking your original thoughts, cutting out a bunch and asking questions and expressing frustrations more directly. That's why I quoted from your original message, it was much more clear to me."

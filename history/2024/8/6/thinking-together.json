Without reference to a solution? Try to be precise about the audience. For example, some problems affect everyone, while others affect only professional programmers, or only researchers who use computers in their work.\n\nMy hypothesis is that focusing on problems will help us all find our most promising collaborators in this group. (The next step will be to combat our tendency to be defined by our tools, to let our tools erect barriers that divide and balkanize us. But that's further down the road. For now, let's just \"find our homies,\" the people we share specific dissatisfactions with.)\n\nThere are ideas for problem statements in a couple of earlier threads:\n\u2022 <https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1718448593662299>\n\u2022 <https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1717926129937119>\n\u2022 <https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C01932BJGE8/p1721870703344739>\nBut this thread is not for critiquing or analyzing any of those statements.

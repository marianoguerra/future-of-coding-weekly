Nodes can now have meta information to show internal data which is stored on the node level that is not shown on the node itself. For the neural network nodes this are the weights and biases.\n\nAlso the structure of the neural network itself can be viewed in a scalable way instead of just the nodes on the canvas itself. And with scalable I mean not showing all the nodes, but only a max of 10 per layer and add smaller dots in between to illustrate that there are more nodes then just the max 10 that are shown per layer. The number of dots are different depending on the total node count to make it clear that layers differ in total node count.\n\nYou can see it here: <https://youtu.be/dvZrWEz1W4k> or try it yourself at <http://demo.codeflowcanvas.io|demo.codeflowcanvas.io> and select the neural network mnist training & testing example.",

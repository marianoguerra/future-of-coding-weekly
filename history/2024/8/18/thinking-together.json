        "text": "Some criticisms, mostly of my own failure to communicate what was in my mind with this exercise.\n\n_Problem statements_\n\nI think many problem statements were infected by the solution in the mind of the author. Phrases like \"there oughta be\" or \"the world needs\" are red flags of this failure mode. I think all my 6s were because of this. Either your problem is intensely personal, and you're doing art for art's sake (perfectly legitimate! see Jackson Pollock or Van Gogh!) or I think there's room here to make your problem less muddy, to give it a more separate existence from the solution you're working on.\n\nA lesser failure mode: Phrases like \"because\" and \"due to\" are red flags that you're over-specifying an approach to a problem. There seems some value in more focus. If problem A seems to have sub-problem B, do you care about B in isolation, or A as a whole? Pick one. If it's A, be open to other approaches. If it's B, then it should be able to stand alone as a resonant problem. (I made this mistake as well in an earlier thread, <https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1718449988190349?thread_ts=1718448593.662299&cid=C5T9GPWFL|and even had a sub-sub-problem>; the instinct to boil the ocean is very powerful but misguided.)\n\n<@U6KQ2S410>: what are some examples of special-purpose technologies? A single editor window containing say some Lua code without any libraries seems to me to be \"not shattered\", but it's still certainly likely to contain friction and complexity, particularly to people inexperienced with programming. Perhaps what would help is stating the target demographic. Do you care about just programmers or just non-programmers or both or something else? Perhaps I should have asked everyone to mention that in problem statements..\n\n_Reactions to problem statements_\n\n<https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1722838639110989?thread_ts=1722660123.009799&cid=C5T9GPWFL|Konrad Hinsen read my levels 4 and 5> with a tacit \"in the context of my work\" to them. \"There are problem statements here whose background and motivation I can perfectly well understand, but which I don't see as important in my own work.\" I would tend to categorize those as level 3, so it looks like my rubric is ambiguously worded. I'm curious how others interpreted my levels, and if they see other potential room for ambiguity.\n\nSpecial mention to <@UC2A2ARPT> for willfully stretching the rules of the game both in problem statements and reactions. My star map didn't know what to do with vectors, ranges like 0-5, negative numbers and complex numbers :laughing: Thanks for playing sportingly, even though it seems clear that you don't really care about thinking in terms of problems, in the vein of Pollock and Van Gogh..",

Either your problem is intensely personal, and you're doing art for art's sake (perfectly legitimate! see Jackson Pollock or Van Gogh!) or I think there's room here to make your problem less muddy, to give it a more separate existence from the solution you're working on.\n\nA lesser failure mode: Phrases like \"because\" and \"due to\" are red flags that you're over-specifying an approach to a problem. There seems some value in more focus. If problem A seems to have sub-problem B, do you care about B in isolation, or A as a whole? Pick one. If it's A, be open to other approaches. If it's B, then it should be able to stand alone as a resonant problem. (I made this mistake as well in an earlier thread, "

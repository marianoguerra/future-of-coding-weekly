The ship models? Hacked together from repurposing strange parts they had lying around. The details? Just enough to make it look great. The blinking buttons interface? Just a few lightbulbs behind the buttons that were supposed to blink. If that doesn\u2019t remind you of software development, you\u2019re not doing it right. Or you are, and that\u2019s part of the problem. :wink:\n\u2022 I know, there\u2019s some physicality to all the examples in the video, but the LCARS interface points to the possibility of designing something in software only that can transcend its functional framing and become more than just a prop. We have a few examples of that in software (\u201cYou had me at scrolling\u201d), but not nearly as much as we should have, I think.\nWhere are the videos like this that celebrate achievements in software design?",

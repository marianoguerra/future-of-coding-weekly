Well-specficied build system (meaning an input format specification that actually corresponds to what the parser takes)\nIf we give up 1, we use a Markdown-to-HTML compiler with a parser for something well-defined (Commonmark, djot, etc.).\nIf we give up 2, we use HTML as our direct input format.\nIf we give up 3, we use some regexp-munging for transforming something Markdown-like to something HTML-like.\n\nMy personal order of preference is 2, 1, 3 (the number being the feature I am willing to give up). I am not going to give any arguments, because I can easily give arguments for any of the three choices. It really comes down to weighing them against each other.\n\nIf everyone agrees that these are the trade-offs, we could do a poll to see what we mostly care about.",

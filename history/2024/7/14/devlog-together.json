I hope this helps in developing the new open canvas spec that the ocwg is working on via bi-weekly meetings and a github repo (see various links on <https://www.canvasprotocol.org>).\n\nLately I am focussing more on embedding and/or integrating codeflowcanvas with other tools and technologies so that it is not running in a silo of its own, and this feature helps with that I think.\n\nThis week I also send in a submission to <http://liveprog.org|liveprog.org>.",

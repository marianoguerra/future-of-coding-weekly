I guess right now I'm missing both - I can imagine possible representation. Currently, this is a sequence of edits that do something to a document (app/whatever).\n\nI think I could do what I want if I added a way to say an edit is only applicable if a certain condition holds (otherwise it should be skipped when replaying). The other thing I need is some kind of \"apply these edits to all of these things\". I think I can add these two things to the representation reasonably well - then the limiting factor will be a sensible UI for those. (So if there are any PbD systems that have similar concepts, I'd be curious how they handle the user-interaction...)\n\nIt may also be that my current thinking about the representation is wrong - and so if there are other ways of doing this, it would be interesting to know...\n\nI remember seeing nice demos in Wrangler - where generalization was easy (you do things on one row, it generalizes to all other rows). But I suppose in document context, you can generalise to something like (perhaps cleverly inferred) CSS selector...",

I guess right now I'm missing both - I can imagine possible representation. Currently, this is a sequence of edits that do something to a document (app/whatever).\n\nI think I could do what I want if I added a way to say an edit is only applicable if a certain condition holds (otherwise it should be skipped when replaying). The other thing I need is some kind of \"apply these edits to all of these things\". I think I can add these two things to the representation reasonably well - then the limiting factor will be a sensible UI for those. (So if there are any PbD systems that have similar concepts, I'd be curious how they handle the user-interaction...)\n\nIt may also be that my current thinking about the representation is wrong - and so if there are other ways of doing this, it would be interesting to know...\n\nI remember seeing nice demos in Wrangler - where generalization was easy (you do things on one row, it generalizes to all other rows).

So a few of these sheets of paper, working together, might enable the \"identify fiducials\" behaviour, by communicating with each other, each of them doing a tiny bit of computation. Some of them might represent some piece of supporting tech, like a sensor (eg camera) or an actuator (eg projector), and act like an API to that thing. One of the things you could do in this setup was point a keyboard object (with its own fiducials) at one of these sheets of paper, and edit the wishes and claims that constitute the computation that that sheet of paper possesses. That means if there's actual \"\"\"code\"\"\" printed on that piece of paper, the code is now out of sync with the real \"object\" (in memory), but that's fine \u2014 you could just wish for a new version of that object to be printed as code on paper, take down the old one, and put up the new one, and now they're back in sync.\n\nThen, in 2020, after the pandemic, they needed a way to take Realtalk home with them. So instead of doing all this on a poster, they condensed it down to a binder. Crucially, the pieces of paper don't always need to be visible at all times \u2014 the paper (or any object) is just a physical representation of its own behaviour. So you can pull out the paper and let a camera see it if you want to work on that object's behaviour, but when you're not working on it, you can tuck it into a binder. The object still exists. (I think there's some nuance here, since some objects do need to be visible in order for their computation to run, but I think that's, like, a choice of trigger, to put it in eToys speak).\n\nNow, with Realtalk 2024, they're trying to get further away from the \"textual code on pieces of paper with fiducials\" bits, by making it so that you don't need (A) the fiducials to track objects, (B) the pieces of paper \u2014 bits of behaviour can be manipulated readily by other kinds of representation, eg drawings \u2014 and (C) the textual code, or at least not the sort of textual code they've been using thus far, which is basically some existing language (python, JS, C, etc) with a DSL for wish/claim.",

Some of them might represent some piece of supporting tech, like a sensor (eg camera) or an actuator (eg projector), and act like an API to that thing. One of the things you could do in this setup was point a keyboard object (with its own fiducials) at one of these sheets of paper, and edit the wishes and claims that constitute the computation that that sheet of paper possesses. That means if there's actual \"\"\"code\"\"\" printed on that piece of paper, the code is now out of sync with the real \"object\" (in memory), but that's fine \u2014 you could just wish for a new version of that object to be printed as code on paper, take down the old one, and put up the new one, and now they're back in sync.\n\nThen, in 2020, after the pandemic, they needed a way to take Realtalk home with them. So instead of doing all this on a poster, they condensed it down to a binder. Crucially, the pieces of paper don't always need to be visible at all times \u2014 the paper (or any object) is just a physical representation of its own behaviour. So you can pull out the paper and let a camera see it if you want to work on that object's behaviour, but when you're not working on it, you can tuck it into a binder. The object still exists. (I think there's some nuance here, since some objects do need to be visible in order for their computation to run, but I think that's, like, a choice of trigger, to put it in eToys speak).\n\nNow, with Realtalk 2024, they're trying to get further away from the \"textual code on pieces of paper with fiducials\" bits, by making it so that you don't need (A) the fiducials to track objects, (B) the pieces of paper \u2014 bits of behaviour can be manipulated readily by other kinds of representation, eg drawings \u2014 and (C) the textual code, or at least not the sort of textual code they've been using thus far, which is basically some existing language (python, JS, C, etc) with a DSL for wish/claim."

Lies-to-children are fine, but would like it to demonstrate at least basic mechanics: (A) wind caused by hotter air rising and leaving a vacuum; (B) evaporation over sea =&gt; rain over land (C) \"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_shadow|rain shadow>\" beyond a mountain (my country has this).\nIt's not easy to discretize continuous-quantity equations into something like a cellular automaton...  I'm leaning towards representing conserved quantities like water with tokens you can move, rather than per-cell state.\nAnd I don't want some huge \"simulation\"\u2014I'd love to find rules that can demonstrate these processes in few enough steps to follow by hand.\nHmm say I have air that wants to go up + right, and it holds just 1 water token\u2014which way do I move it?  Well I suppose I want a bit larger numbers so quantization won't matter that much...  And I probably want alternating horizontal vs. vertical game phases (also dealing with 1D slice at a time can reduce previous-vs-next-state confusions).\nAny advice for tools to help think about rules/mechanics and what can emerge from them, _beyond_ \"try and see what what happens\"?\n(But I guess I really should play with large \"sand\" style models, then try to scale down! try-and-see _is_ more powerful than merely keeping in my head.)",

I'm leaning towards representing conserved quantities like water with tokens you can move, rather than per-cell state.\nAnd I don't want some huge \"simulation\"\u2014I'd love to find rules that can demonstrate these processes in few enough steps to follow by hand.\nHmm say I have air that wants to go up + right, and it holds just 1 water token\u2014which way do I move it?  Well I suppose I want a bit larger numbers so quantization won't matter that much...  And I probably want alternating horizontal vs. vertical game phases (also dealing with 1D slice at a time can reduce previous-vs-next-state confusions).\nAny advice for tools to help think about rules/mechanics and what can emerge from them, "

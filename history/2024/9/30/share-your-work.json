We (the <https://www.kendra.io|Kendraio> <https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kendraio_kendraio-kendraioapp-interoperability-activity-7199366975783858177-3vKL|team>) are currently experimenting with no-code, local-first and malleable-software isms.\n\nWe want to create a local environment where it is really easy for end-users and non-developers to build workflows and manage their own data, whilst also being able to plug into the services (apps and websites) that they currently use and build their own user-interfaces for those services. It's a big dream and we've started small.\n\nA few years ago during the pandemic we built a <https://app.kendra.io/kendraio/coronavirus|dashboard for COVID-19 data>. Our Flow plugged into various APIs and then visualised the received data on one page \u2013 so a good demonstration of one aspect of our dream. The dashboard still exists but shows historical data. We wrote an <https://medium.com/kendraio/covid-19-kendraio-creates-coronavirus-dashboard-within-kendraio-app-a0185e526b25|article> about the dashboard which also has an accompanying <https://youtu.be/OD_SN99Sy8Q|video> explaining how it works and how you can edit the Flow while it's running.\n\nEnjoy! Look forward to any comments or questions. Cheers!",

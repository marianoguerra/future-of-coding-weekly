Broadly speaking I would like to have tool similar to what we see in this clip: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGYFEI6uLy0>\nConsider The following more specific scenario:\nI have a PKM Zettelkasten and I have some friends. Now my workflow is to write and then to publish. I want to provide for them a Voice assistant that can summarize contents based on various parameters: By time e.g. topics of last 3 months, last week.

I can only write from my experience.  So first of all a bit about my context about Alan Kay, here is a link to my Main Zettel File about Alans work: <https://andreass.gitlab.io/2022/AlanKay.html> . So Although alan has tried to create some form of context for Computer Technology it did not go to places where it may be should have gone.\nWhen I first encountered the STEPS project I was deeply impressed with its technical ambition. But what happend with the final report? There was no coherent source code release of the work. Some researchers did put out _some_ code in _some_ form but it wasn't nothing like the system Alan showed, Why wasn't that put out to the public? Was it because of funding issues that led to troubles with research goals and communicating the whole thing? That still feels very unsettling, on the one hand Alan participated in xerox parc or he talks about Martin luther but then he and his research group fail to think about ways how to actually _communicate_ their technology which could provide paradigm shift potential.  You can see some of the strange in this github issue comment thread: <https://github.com/damelang/nile/issues/3>\nOver the course of many years (!) people asked about ways to understand even this graphic sub system, let alone the bigger systems philosophy of the STEPS project.\nSo at some point the idea what research means or that you can have a idea on the level of paradigm shift and be able to share it.  Some aspects of it you can see here where alan gives a talk but then there happens some _actual_ discussion after that: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFc379hu--8> the video is 1:20 , the relevant discussion happens about 1:17. Where you can see how confused alan is about what the students perception is what he is doing at university - could be or should be doing.  I think with the years after the STEPS project Alan slowly realized that it is not only difficult nowadays to create something novel and hope or work towards a unfolding of that paradigm shift even talking about becomes difficult such that it enters the teritory of cargo cults (see Alans Conversation with Gardner Campell for context about that)  I think this can be seen in this talk for example: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9ZGFaIHegE>. In this talk from 2019 Alan talks on a conference for circular economy for the alan macarthur foundation. He is basically asked to explain how he as part of xerox research community did achieve that, how did they initiate a paradigm shift ( from pre-personal computing to personal computing). ALan starts of by presenting a list of question and basically asks for a participation on these questions. But after his talk the moderator seems confused that alan did not \"simply\" deliver \"the answer\". While all, at least , to some part part alan was trying to was pointing to that even the structures to talk about a problem ( here working with paradigm shifts) matter and that giving a \"talk\" can not do that, it misses the point.  All of this was pre covid and the culture wars have made cultural understanding even more complicatedon so many levels. I think in some sense its almost impossible to work on technology without work on better understanding of ideas and I do not mean like: oh you \"just\" have to build a better interface which is more intuitevly. Its more work in terms of relationships. See the video from alan called: *Portable Portrait: Alan Kay (1990) from my file above to get a feeling about it.* I'll stop here for now.",

I think with the years after the STEPS project Alan slowly realized that it is not only difficult nowadays to create something novel and hope or work towards a unfolding of that paradigm shift even talking about becomes difficult such that it enters the teritory of cargo cults (see Alans Conversation with Gardner Campell for context about that)  I think this can be seen in this talk for example: "

He is basically asked to explain how he as part of xerox research community did achieve that, how did they initiate a paradigm shift ( from pre-personal computing to personal computing). ALan starts of by presenting a list of question and basically asks for a participation on these questions. But after his talk the moderator seems confused that alan did not \"simply\" deliver \"the answer\". While all, at least , to some part part alan was trying to was pointing to that even the structures to talk about a problem ( here working with paradigm shifts) matter and that giving a \"talk\" can not do that, it misses the point.  All of this was pre covid and the culture wars have made cultural understanding even more complicatedon so many levels. I think in some sense its almost impossible to work on technology without work on better understanding of ideas and I do not mean like: oh you \"just\" have to build a better interface which is more intuitevly. Its more work in terms of relationships. See the video from alan called: "

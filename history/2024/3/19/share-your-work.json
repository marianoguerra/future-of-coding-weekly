Marking them out with arrows shows how the colour does change, to the point that the colour at the end of my perceived \"run\" is somewhat different from the starting colour - maybe laying them out in this ordered fashion isn't showing them off in an ideal situation?"

It appears that the problem is considered difficult because people didn't use the oklch color space, which has only been around since 2020. It was interesting to see the color schemes in D3. Unfortunately, ten out of eleven are black box blobs with no description of how the colors were picked or what they are supposed to be good for. The eleventh one has a blog post describing how it was made, which was by having a graphical designer subjectively pick the colors using an in-house color picker.\n\nPlotting all the D3 color schemes, it appears as if the colors were picked by throwing darts at a color picker. The only deliberate property I see is that some of them try to avoid clustering in a/b. All eleven vary widely in lightness and chroma, which is good for making the colors look more distinct, but bad if you require the colors to be consistent. My color formula seems to be the only one designed with the property that you can take an arbitrary slice of it, and all colors in the slice will be almost uniformely distributed, and add more colors at any time and maintain near uniform distribution without having to rebalance the whole set of colors.\n\nI've attached my plots. I've added my own color scheme on the last page for comparison. <https://typst.app/project/rXnjDEQh9EBvxCEa_6E1YL|Source code> is available.",

It appears that the problem is considered difficult because people didn't use the oklch color space, which has only been around since 2020. It was interesting to see the color schemes in D3. Unfortunately, ten out of eleven are black box blobs with no description of how the colors were picked or what they are supposed to be good for. The eleventh one has a blog post describing how it was made, which was by having a graphical designer subjectively pick the colors using an in-house color picker.\n\nPlotting all the D3 color schemes, it appears as if the colors were picked by throwing darts at a color picker. The only deliberate property I see is that some of them try to avoid clustering in a/b. All eleven vary widely in lightness and chroma, which is good for making the colors look more distinct, but bad if you require the colors to be consistent. My color formula seems to be the only one designed with the property that you can take an arbitrary slice of it, and all colors in the slice will be almost uniformely distributed, and add more colors at any time and maintain near uniform distribution without having to rebalance the whole set of colors.\n\nI've attached my plots. I've added my own color scheme on the last page for comparison. "

It always recovers better than it was before.\n\u2022 Other coins follow the whims of Bitcoin, but with much bigger swings.  \n\u2022 Buy something relatively stable/mature, and enjoy a bigger multiplier 'on the way back up'.\nSo I bought SOL at the 'bottom', and some ADA, and I'm going to cash in at some point soon, and wait for another crash....  The halving is happening this month, and history says that the price will likely climb beyond it, but I'm not relying on it.\n\nThe danger of this strategy is that SOL might suffer some fundamental failure; and perhaps Bitcoin is more stable; hard to tell on that one.  A good compromise would be to buy a more diverse spread of top performing coins at the bottom; ADA, BNB, XRP, AVAX, etc....\n\nThe advantage, as <@U05SU27S1M2> says is that SOL is proof of stake, like Ethereum.  The biggest negative against SOL is that it is seen to be less centralized, because becoming a miner requires a bigger pot and lots of fast hardware.  They all have their issues though.  ADA's tech isn't scaling very well currently, BNB is tied to Binance which might get regulated, etc.  XRP is more 'corporate', etc.\n\nThe nice part of this strategy is that (compared to my previous efforts), it is relatively stress-free.  Buy at the bottom, wait 3-4 years, sell, repeat.  April is going to be an interesting month regardless....",

The halving is happening this month, and history says that the price will likely climb beyond it, but I'm not relying on it.\n\nThe danger of this strategy is that SOL might suffer some fundamental failure; and perhaps Bitcoin is more stable; hard to tell on that one.  A good compromise would be to buy a more diverse spread of top performing coins at the bottom; ADA, BNB, XRP, AVAX, etc....\n\nThe advantage, as "

The biggest negative against SOL is that it is seen to be less centralized, because becoming a miner requires a bigger pot and lots of fast hardware.  They all have their issues though.  ADA's tech isn't scaling very well currently, BNB is tied to Binance which might get regulated, etc.  XRP is more 'corporate', etc.\n\nThe nice part of this strategy is that (compared to my previous efforts), it is relatively stress-free.

Now it's a relief to be able to decide the time to write a paper. When the _project_ needs it, rather than my career or some funding agency's schedule. Most of the time I _don't know_ what I'm doing thoroughly enough to be able to write a paper about it. Perhaps trying to do so will advance things, but I think it has just as much chance of kneecapping them. Oh, and c) these thorough papers are explicitly discouraged at Onward, which is unfortunately coupling life cycle phase with audience.\nWait, why is there so much sand around here.

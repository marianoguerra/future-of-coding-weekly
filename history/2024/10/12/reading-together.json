Can you also look at the most recent update?\n\n<https://youtu.be/RrE_NkExyiw?si=1RSmSpjh4NWCHRhW>\n\nAs for the 3d, I decided to add it slowly. for now prioritizing the core. The thing that overlaps is the augmentation of data. That messages from messaging apps can be moved, linked to let's say to the tasks on project management software.\n\nFor the upcoming month I will push the new update. Where instead reinventing all the apps, I decided to make it as the interface for the services. For messaging I will use Telegram. For project management I will use the Trello. Both have the API. And we can build the custom interface for them. As the Ara as the interface, it will allow messages, tasks to be shared across different services. The AI is the cherry on the cake that can automate the stuff. It's in the long run. I want this web operating system to be as <https://rem.ing/> and AI learns from the all user's behaviour to find common patterns and help automate the stuff so user will interact with the computer less.

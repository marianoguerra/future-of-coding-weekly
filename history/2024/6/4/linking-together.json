Keep keep improving the core language, runtime, and tooling. Examples: adding an FFI to Unison, improving JIT compiler performance, more semantic merge capabilities, and a more graphical UCM experience.\n&gt; 2. Make Unison Share an even nicer place to host your projects. Examples: \"find usages\", site-wide code search, multi-collaborator projects, and more.\n&gt; 3. Major new Unison Cloud features: scheduled jobs, distributed event processing, resilient workflows, and high-performance native execution via our JIT compiler.\n",

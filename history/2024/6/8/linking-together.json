Jordan and Arne discuss their shared interest in circus arts, specifically juggling and flow state. They talk about the European Juggling Convention and the meditative and mental benefits of juggling. They also delve into the topic of Taoism and its influence on their lives, discussing the philosophy of going with the flow and finding natural ways of being. They touch on the importance of self-awareness, mindfulness, and the potential pitfalls of narcissistic spirituality. They also explore the similarities and differences between teaching and leadership, emphasizing the importance of empathy and vulnerability in both roles. Heart of Clojure is a community conference that aims to create a holistic and vibrant experience for software engineers. The conference focuses on deepening the understanding of working in the software industry and building software for the world. It draws inspiration from conferences like Strange Loop and the European Juggling Convention, incorporating activities, workshops, and interactive sessions alongside keynote talks. The organizers aim to create an intimate and inclusive atmosphere where attendees can come alive and explore different aspects of their identity beyond being software engineers. Heart of Clojure encourages open source contributors and maintainers to propose interactive sessions, workshops, and contributor onboarding activities. \nThe conference will take place on September 18-19, 2024, in Leuven, Belgium.\n\nLinks:\nArne - <https://github.com/plexus>\nHeart of Clojure - <https://2024.heartofclojure.eu/>\nOvertone - <https://github.com/overtone/overtone>\n\nKeywords:\nArne, Belgium, Lambda Island, , Clojure Camp, gaiwan, travels, tea, Europe, United States, cooking, gardening, circus arts, juggling, flow state, European Juggling Convention, Taoism, self-awareness, mindfulness, narcissistic spirituality, teaching, leadership, empathy, vulnerability, Heart of Clojure, community conference, holistic experience, software industry, software engineers, activities, workshops, interactive sessions, keynote talks, open source contributors, contributor onboarding, Leuven, Belgium.",

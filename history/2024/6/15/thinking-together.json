(One sentence, not describing a solution.) If it does fit one or more of these buckets, please mention them. (Alternative wordings are also appreciated, but for me the primary goal here is to cluster ourselves.)",

This is very helpful.\n\nI recognize my goals as mostly a combination of the points listed, but there is one more aspect which is somewhat related to other points but also distinct: People (users, other developers, ...) have no chance of knowing precisely what a program does if they have not written it themselves. Put differently, expressing software source code is a form of encryption of the initial developers' intentions.\n\nAn obvious illustration is spyware, but the problem exists even in a world without evil-minded players. In my field of work, computational science, it has become impossible to understand someone else's work, because so much of it is documented only by source code.",

This is very helpful.\n\nI recognize my goals as mostly a combination of the points listed, but there is one more aspect which is somewhat related to other points but also distinct: People (users, other developers, ...) have no chance of knowing precisely what a program does if they have not written it themselves. Put differently, expressing software source code is a form of encryption of the initial developers' intentions.\n\nAn obvious illustration is spyware, but the problem exists even in a world without evil-minded players. In my field of work, computational science, it has become impossible to understand someone else's work, because so much of it is documented only by source code."

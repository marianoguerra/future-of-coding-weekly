It's a stab at Stop Drawing Dead Fish in VR with spreadsheets and something called Geometric Algebra (GA) also known as Clifford Algebra.\n\nThose who have scrutinized Stop Drawing Dead Fish(SDDF) closely might have noticed two references to GA. Bret also used to have a \"Geometric Algebra\" sticker on his laptop! But while GA is a very Bret thing, he actually did not _use_ it to make SDDF, so my thing is trying to make good on that.\n\nGA is a mathematical system where you get a bunch of geometric objects and transformations, and they all get related to one another by math that is quite a lot simpler than usual. For example, in the conventional/non-GA approach, if you wanted a line in 3D space you'd take two \"vectors\" v1 and v2 and say the line is the set of vectors v1+t*v2 for all scalars t. This can be kinda useful, but gets complicated if you ask for a simple thing like a rotation around that line. In the GA way of doing things, instead of being \"a set of vectors\", a line is its own sort of object - lines can be added together; multiplied by planes and rotations; etc. Lots of useful operations turn out to be examples of this, I've attached a pdf of examples.\n\n\"doing math/programming by working directly with (tangible/visualizable) geometric objects instead of with linear equations\" should strike you as a centrally Bret thing.

Well, he presented Cl(4) and Cl(4,1) as being useful.

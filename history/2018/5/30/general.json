I'm starting to think that we have a meta-problem: we lack an evaluation methodology which enables us to make incremental progress. You can't single-handedly build a whole new way of programming in a single stroke. Scientific progress happens because people build upon each other's results validated by objective experiments. But empirical experiments on programming have had very limited value. In practice we seem to judge programming research by \"coolness\". I conclude that coolness has failed us and we don't know what else to use. We must solve this methodology problem before we can make progress on programming. [I'm beta-testing this idea and would appreciate criticism]",

I definitely agree that 'coolness' isn't a great criteria. \n\nFor criticism I have two points. First, science and research may not progress in clean incremental steps but in a somewhat haphazard ways - e.g. a big leap in the generally good direction may also include a bunch of crufty ideas. Then this could be followed by a series of simplifications to cut out the cruft from the useful ideas. Second, I'm not sure how an evaluation experiment would be designed to work around the 'familiarity bias'. It took me years to really get comfortable with the current (limited) forms of programming so there's likely a strong bias towards the familiar models. A significantly better but unfamiliar model may not appear to work as well in a limited evaluation experiment. Perhaps we need non-programmers to try these out?",

        "text": "As experienced programmers we’re kind of stuck on this local optimum where we built ourselves a pretty comfortable environment around typing symbols into text editors. It’s hard to reach other, perhaps higher mountains around us without leaving behind even some of the stuff that we take for granted as crucial infrastructure.\n\nOne reason I think we’re stuck is because we usually take approaches that try to build a full-blown programming language that has all the expressiveness we’re used to from currently popular programming languages. I believe a new paradigm needs simplification, and that needs to get rid of (hide) some of the expressiveness.\n\nAnother reason I think we’re stuck is that we usually want to find a better way to program for people like us — other programmers. But as programmers we have so high requirements to what we want in a tool that it’s not feasible to target ourselves as the primary audience. My bet is on a future audience of people who don’t even want to learn programming today, who will be able to construct applications from simple building blocks to create or modify the applications they use today to change them to fit their specific need better.\n\nI can see data scientists who learn programming today, because they reach the limitations of their tools. And while some of them learn to enjoy it, many just learn it to get stuff done they can’t get done otherwise.\n\nI can see designers prototyping user interfaces, but then in the end instead of hiring a developer, they just push a few more buttons in their prototyping tool and will be able to export a proper application.\n\nWe need to meet these new audiences halfway, and abstract away some of the complexities we today believe are necessary to get anything done. Even if that means “it’s not really programming”. And that doesn’t mean our symbol-crunching compilers and interpreters will go away. Just like you can still drop down to assembly (or C, which is also “dropping down” for many these days), we will still be able to do that. Potentially to create the higher-level components our data scientist and designer friends will use to get their stuff done.",

Alan Kay shares his opinion about getting funding these days in pretty much every later presentation you can find of him. I think he has given up the hope that fundamental research is fundable in tech at this point. You either build a product and get Angel\/VC money, or you’re done. I’d think he’d say such an endeavor is not feasible in a typical startup lifespan, as it needs more fundamental research.",

One other thing we're incredibly good at is building all these silos of different language and platform communities, where we can all re-invent wheels all the time. I think there is a benefit in this language diversity, but it's hard to reap, because these different communities seldom talk to each other.",

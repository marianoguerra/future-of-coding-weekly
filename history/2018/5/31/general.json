Based on this discussion I'm trying to extract the 'values' from various notes I have - though I'm not sure what qualifies as a 'value' (vs a design goal or principle). One value\/aspiration I have is that 'programming should be tangible and live'. The broader theme perhaps is 'dont make me simulate the computer'. My post about that is here: <http:\/\/shalabh.com\/programmable-systems\/wheres-my-simulator.html|shalabh.com\/programmable-systems\/wheres-my-simulator.html>",

Also you can represent a few different views of the contents in the same medium, unlike text blob editing. Once you go into a cell you're still back to text though.\n\nI think what I was trying to get at earlier is the contrast between the 'program' and the 'system'. Using 'programs' is only one of many possible way to desing and build a larger 'system'. Could there be other ways to decompose and build\/modify a system? Could I, for instance, have a model where I explore a system to easily discover the various componenets (and sub-components and so on), and when I find what i'm looking for, modify it 'in-place'. The 'component' modified here might be very small, e.g. equivalent to a function. This is very different from what it takes to modify a single function in a large running system today. Everything from discovery, explorability to update requires knowledge of various intermediate systems (source control, build systems, compilers, deployment systems, 'the process model').",

(Just started though Fong and Spivak have certainly have written other interesting things.)\n\nMath texts often devolve into a trite definition-theorem-proof style with little justification for why those specific definitions, theorems, and proofs are of special interest.  Category Theory doubly so as a framework for understanding mathematical relationships.  Take Awodey's text <https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Category-Theory-Oxford-Logic-Guides\/dp\/0199237182\/> as an example.\n\nRiehl presents a thorough argument answering \"why Category Theory?\" aimed squarely at mathematicians <https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Conceptual-Mathematics-First-Introduction-Categories\/dp\/052171916X>.  What about the rest of us?\n\nThere's Lawvere and Schanuel introduction <https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Conceptual-Mathematics-First-Introduction-Categories\/dp\/052171916X> that amounts to \"gee-whiz sums and products make sense for all sorts of things besides numbers.\"\n\nOn that backdrop, I'm hopeful that Fong and Spivak will prove a more provocative introduction for people like you Guido: more substance than Lawvere and Schanuel, less esoteric than Riehl.\n\n(Some of you may notice that this approach to talking about a book is categorical in the sense that I described one in its relation to others.)",

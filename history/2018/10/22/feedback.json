        "text": "My feedback: there’s two thrusts in the proposal. One is declaring an API interface in a tool-enforceable way, the second is defining a distributed computation model. Declaring API interfaces in a machine-readable and tool-enforceable way is :100:. Such APIs schemas could yield big benefits for the web ecosystem (I started work on a version of this based around ADTs, but it’s tabled because I simply don’t write APIs these days). But note you don’t need to tie this interface schema to a particular language. As for the language itself, I’m a little confused. “Sort of” pure functions? Only per-client state? I’m not sure what the goal is: is it supposed to simplify full-stack dev? Or is it supposed to be a way of representing app pieces as microservices? Can you clarify what the aim is here?",

I can see some sort of service description language being a critical part of such a system.\n- Working with Go recently has led me to think strong typing is annoying and unnecessary.",

        "text": "<@UC6997THT> YouTube is a bit bigger than GitHub and has monetization and recommendation and – most importantly – is engaging in a fundamentally different way.  Perhaps the common element is that they are online platforms were people put stuff.  (This does make them a little less similar to online platforms where people primarily do stuff e.g. play games or discuss stuff e.g. right here).  I'd claim that monetization is less important than the other differences.\n\nNow about you Unity plugin, this is perfect example of how a dollar isn't worth a dollar and how cost\/benefit tradeoffs lead to sort of market failure, at least a dollar priced market failure: the responsibility of accepting just isn't worth it $5-$25.  For example I think the primary way people \"pay\" for Open Source libraries is in dedicating their attention to learn and use them.",

It’s not money that made YouTube worse, it’s the ad-based business model monetizing viewers attention that did.\n\nHBO and Netflix have a different model that at least incentivized them to produce high-quality content so people are willing to pay for a monthly subscription, because they love watching Game of Thrones or Westworld.\n\nI don’t know what a good model for software could be.

Not the fight I've chosen, but I'm definitely glad others care about these issues.\n\nYou're right that it depends on the business model. I don't claim a solution has to not involve money. I just claim that merely adding money to an existing business model isn't always going to improve things. Maybe that's our point of agreement?\n\nThe whole point of money has been that it made the incommensurable commensurable. If that is becoming increasingly untrue then the role of money is arguably becoming a lot less central to the economy.

As non-monetary concerns grow in importance, it becomes harder to reason about those concerns.

        "text": "Since you brought up a scifi metaphors, and since the metaphors we use have a powerful effect on our desires and goals, I'll throw out a couple of scifi metaphors that have influenced me for years. Not pushing back on anything you said, just a _non sequitur_ in hopes of continuing the conversation.\n\na) While our hopes for the future tend to look like the _Enterprise_, all gleaming chrome and clean interfaces, I now hanker after something more like the _Serenity_ (<https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kQtdfh2Uxoo>), all the wires and ductwork hanging out. While it's not as nice to look at, it seems far more hackable and democratic. Habitable. (<http:\/\/akkartik.name\/post\/habitability>)\n\nb) Asimov's Second Foundation, as a sort of less tangible counterweight to the tangible technological advancement of the First Foundation. The First Foundation was technologically advanced like the Star Trek universe, but people were still recognizably people in their ethical and cognitive limitations. The Second Foundation was Asimov's attempt to envision a world of _better_ people. While he got the details understandably wrong (there's no reason to believe telepathy will make people better), I think there's something to the idea of changing ourselves to improve the efficacy of our tools. The change I imagine is to incentives. People already have huge incentives to not be anti-social, but only locally so. I'd like to live in a world where just as much attention goes to _global_ consequences of behavior. This is a technology problem too, but the solution will look very different from our usual examples of technology. It may well end up being as simple as a checklist.",

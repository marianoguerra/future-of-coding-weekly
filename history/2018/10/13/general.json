        "text": "Listening to the lastest podcast: Sustaining the Underfunded and a few comments\n\nA few random comments\n\nthe first was I was surprised no discussion about how money might ruin open source. my example would be I have this fiction that YouTube has ruined certain things. I go there and it feels like a dumpster fire of random people trying to make their random channel which seem to be mostly trying to chase money .  Like I feel like youtube would be 1000x better if there was no money. I'm probably wrong and I certainly enjoy a few good channels but the bad outweight the good. As a good (bad) example I found a large set of music mix channels that are just girls in bikinis in the tropics set to random mixes. There's nothing wrong with that idea until I realized all the mixes are basically the same music and even the clips are the same clips. u wouldnt doubt that it's auto generated. As another example the WatchMojo channel which is like linkbait videos . just ever random topic they can think of and I don't think either of those would exist with YouTube wasn't paying rev share.\n\nso ... with open source , imagine a fund existed. I'd expect at some point people would try to game the fund?\n\n",

        "text": "I have yet to listen to the podcast, but I don’t think it’s as easy as saying “money ruined x”. We live in a capitalist world, and that means a lot of things are driven by money. This can be good and bad.\n\nI do agree that there are some ways where money is used in the wrong and dangerous ways. Often it’s the business model that creates unintended consequences. YouTube (and Facebook) are broken because the ad model sets wrong incentives, so we ruined privacy and have algorithms that keep people in their bubbles or worse show them more extreme stuff. The App Store and Play Store are broken because they set expectations that you can get good value for free and they devalued good work. US politics is broken because of lobbying and the way campaigning works, shifting power to the wealthy. But that’s all not just purely because money exists, but because of the way it is used.\n\nAt the end of the day, there needs to be some money coming from somewhere if you want to do anything sustainable. Even open source projects where people spend just their free time, these people need to feel secure enough to sustain their daily lives and have the money for that. Nobody would count that into the cost of their project, but if that money disappears, for sure their priorities would change quickly.\n\nSo I wouldn’t want to say let’s keep money out of open source, because it’s already there anyway, even if we can’t see it directly. I do however support thinking hard about the impact certain funding models might have, especially in terms of unintended consequences.",

Very different outcomes. \nThe problem isn’t the tool (knives\/money), but how you use it. If you say “tool is bad” you’re using a rhetoric trick of charging something neutral with meaning (negative or positive — works in both directions) that is done all the time, whether you are aware of it\/doing it intentionally or not.\n\nI don’t understand what you mean by “current implementation of money” and why I’m using a “more general” meaning. I’m talking about money as the universally accepted medium to exchange and store value, including all its good and bad uses. If you consider the “current implementation” something that is inherently bad for some reason, I’d love for you to elaborate why that is.\n\nThat said and putting this probably not too relevant linguistic hair-splitting aside, I absolutely agree that thinking about incentives, and consequences, and values is something our industry specifically needs to learn and get a lot better at.",

Like the ones we've discussed here: incentivizing creators on Youtube or on open source projects.\n\nMy rough rule of thumb is that if it's a task where someone (_any other person on the planet_ excluding the one performing the task) can come along afterwards and say objectively that the task was done well or not, and the ruling is not subject to change in the future, then money and similar extrinsic incentives[1] work well. But if it's a task that's impossible to verify then you end up needing to rely on intrinsic motivation[2]. It's impossible for a manager or user to tell if a software project is good. It can seem to do the task but turn out to be infected with malware. It may be fine initially but get an automatic update that is user hostile. With these possibilities I no longer feel secure just paying dollars for a product. I need to know who built it and get a sense for their motivations. I need to build a _relationship_ with them.\n\nHopefully this clarifies where I'm coming from.\n\n[1] <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Motivation#Incentive_theories:_intrinsic_and_extrinsic_motivation>\n\n[2] This is why professing \"passion\" for a job is a thing that happens. Employers know they have a task that requires intrinsic motivation, and employees know that employers know.",

But that’s unfortunately how markets work. If there is value, people will come and try to exploit that. But it also paves the way and breaks down barriers of entry for everyone, making it possible for real value creators and those who just want to express themselves to contribute. The money amplifies or accelerates both the good and the bad parts. One comes with the other. Even if we’d only like to have the good parts.",

        "text": "&gt; I’m trying to wrap my head around tasks where extrinsic incentives work well according to your definition — do you have an example for what you had in mind?\n\nPretty much anything in the \"old economy\", the things we did for thousands of years. It's trivial to count the number of shirts a worker sews in an assembly line, and even relatively easy to perform quality control on each shirt. But knowledge work increases the degrees of freedom of each worker manyfold.\n\n&gt; And if I understand you correctly, you mean that writing software does not fall into that category?\n\nYeah. The rise of open source software is a pretty strong hint here. There's something that changes when programmers can choose what they work on. Part of it is that their concerns become more long term. When it's just a job one is more inclined to take shortcuts, particularly if they won't be noticed for a few weeks or months (by which time you may have switched teams, or gotten promoted). But if it's your baby you think about it in the shower, you argue and agonize endlessly about tiny decisions. And the thousands of tiny decisions done right move the needle on externally visible quality.\n\nModern \"20% time\" and periodic in-company hackathons try to combine industrial organization with intrinsic motivation. You get paid, but you also get a looser leash to decide what to do. (But not _too_ loose, because we don't yet know how to make it work.)\n\n&gt; Going back to <@UC6997THT>’s YouTube example: I think “YouTube would be 1000x better without money” triggered my response\n\nAt least the way I interpreted it, it was a statement of fact rather than values. When Youtube first started, the time of the original generation of Numa-numa memes (<https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KmtzQCSh6xk>) it was uneven but often authentic and serendipitous. When they first started paying creators things got better for a time (so no, money is not all negative), but the competition for money drew in more people who wouldn't otherwise make videos. And it brought in the A\/B testers. And all that over ten years has made it a thousand times worse than before the money. Money had benefits, and yes both benefits and drawbacks magnified, but _in this arena_ the drawbacks have swamped benefits.\n\nOr at least that's how I see it.",

        "text": "as for the YouTube example I don't know what would fix it. Im just comparing GitHub to Youtube. On GitHub I see mostly love and sharing and on YouTube I see people posting junk for money. If you added money to GitHub in the wrong way you might get more of the effects seen on YouTube. People trying to game the ratings and stars so they get the most downloads and therefore the most money. Of course that's not the only way to use money to support open source.\n\nI feel also like often open source is like volunteering. I get paid in the good feelings I get from sharing solutions. The moment I get paid those good feelings disappear as it's just a job for hire.\n\nI also make stuff open source because the market won't bare the cost and that the price people are willing to pay they ask for 10x in support and having taken their money I will feel obligated to give it to them.\n\nThis is my impression of much of the Unity plugin market. I could charge between $5 and $25 for my plugin because that's all the market will bare given 95% of it is high school students , college students , and starving indie devs. But, in doing so I'd be expected to provide $100-$200 in support in particular because those customers are inexperienced programmers and so don't get how to use the plugin and effectively want my to write their game.",

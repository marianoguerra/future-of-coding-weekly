        "text": "Hiya, I live in London and currently work on a consumer app that's unrelated to all this.\n\nHowever, lately I've been gripped by the idea that the way we build our computing systems today can't possibly be sustainable. Assuming we're still computing in 1000 years, I'm convinced it won't look like this—so how do we start moving in that direction?\n\nAt the beginning of my career almost 20 years ago I worked on a system at MAYA Design (Civium\/Visage\/VIA Repository) that used unconventional approaches like storing data in key-value dictionaries with UUIDs that could be easily distributed\/synced across the network, as well as a message-based\/boxes-and-wires programming model where the code modules were also stored in these dictionaries, so that computing could happen wherever was convenient. (It mostly worked, but was a bit slow.)\n\nI'm interested in seeing what systems have been built since then that explore similar ideas, since I feel that data storage &amp; management is a useful lens to help us see the future of computing. I've already spent a few days following links from this Slack, and the closest things I found so far were the Houyhnhnm Computing essays, <http:\/\/Sandstorm.io|Sandstorm.io>, IPFS, Urbit, and Camlistore. (I'd appreciate pointers to other things in that vein.)\n\nI'm also very interested in the meta-problem of how to architect new technologies in a way that aligns people's and companies' incentives to increase their chances of getting developed and adopted.\n\nThanks to <@U5TCAFTD3> for building this beacon to help us find each other, and to <@U5STGTB3J> for getting me on board. Looking forward to meeting some of you at a future London meetup!",

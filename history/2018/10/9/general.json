        "text": "<@U8A5MS6R1>\n&gt; I'm definitely interested in learning about the details of what you are thinking about.\n\nThe idea is simple:\n\nWe need to store code somewhere, to be able reference it, do fine-grained versioning, link data to exact version of code, exact place in code, etc. Many wonderful features require code to be stored and referenced. So we need to store code in some kind of data structure. Looking at ipfs and git we may come to conclusion that DAG might be that kind of data structure.\n\nDAG is a directed acyclic graph. Each node has body, and number of links with keys to other nodes.\n\nDAG is so expressive, that it can represent many other datatypes: list, set, dictionary. If so, we can use it as the only compound datatype in language for now, it simplifies everything greatly. So you have functions, that accept single DAG argument and return a DAG. Keyed links serve as named arguments in other languages.\n\nNext thing is pattern matching, through which you gonna do branching. Just like you have patterns for lists and dicts, it's possible to define pattern for a DAG. Something like that: {Value, key1: Node1, VariableKey =&gt; Node2 | RestLinks}. You may add guards to these patterns.\n\nThen find a way to encode that kind of patterns and functions into DAG itself.\nThis way you get nice pure language that is reminds lisp a bit, due it's homoiconicy.\n\nI haven't fully decided how IO gonna look like.\nI like the idea of putting code inside actors (just like Erlang).\nSpliting all code into statements: send, receive, spawn, loop, return, match, dirty-call;\nExpressions: pure-call, compose (the opposite of pattern deconstruction).",

What is proper vs improper abstraction?\n\nI look at abstraction as kind of a compression - you extract some common pattern from *copies* and can then represent the system more compactly. However the presence of copies that share some aspects but not others is the starting point of seeking abstractions.\n\nNow if we specify something compactly using an abstraction, we have to mentally 'fill' the abstractions to see what is really going on (i.e. mentally reconstruct the full copy). So if we want our system to help us visualize this, we're back at rendering the fully constructed copies. If this works well it would render the abstracted parts and parameterized parts differently - perhaps allowing different operations on each. But the point I'm making is that 'working with copies' isn't incompatible with building better abstractions.",

I don’t think that functions and “connected copies” should be distinct concepts though, because the latter is superfluous as a separate feature. Perhaps Ctrl + C should generate an (invisible-by-default) anonymous function to abstract the selection rather than doing an AST-based copy (preventing regular copying from even being achievable) and there should be a key combo that allows users to “expand” and edit a particular instance of where the function is used, thereby editing the function itself. It would likely be a lot of work to make a good UX for this, at which point we could study how\/when\/whether it’s a useful feature.",

In a wiki system, changes are applied without anyone needing to approve beforehand. I think this would work great for comments \/ docs, and for code (which needs more stability), each edit could lead to a new version with references to other code snippets also targeting a specific versions. Users would manually update to new versions, probably assisted by ratings or whether an update breaks relevant tests. ",

        "text": "<@UA14TGLTC> I share your daydream ;-) I think that incompatible and unmaintained projects are indeed a big problem and I think that a wiki-like system could address both. There's no unmaintained wikipedia site as long as anyone cares enough to perform changes. Incompatibility can mean a lot of things and I'm focusing on library incompatibility in the following (please correct me if you meant something else). If there are for example two projects for creating plots (like matplotlib and plotly for example), they would usually be developed by two different teams. Even if both projects shared a common core (e.g. drawing a simple line) that could be refactored, the project and team structures would most likely prevent this. In an optimal environment, anyone could search for common stuff and refactor it by replacing with a more general solution. This could evolve over time and lead to abstractions that a single person \/ team \/ company could not have come up with initially. ",

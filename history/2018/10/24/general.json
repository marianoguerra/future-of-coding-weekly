I'm trying to use that methodology to prototype an extension to FRP that allows for \"backend data\", which would allow for webapps with logins, saved state, and collaborative use. I've been finding it difficult to follow the methodology alone. Would anyone be willing to be a denotational design partner for a couple hours? (Of course, I'd be willing to trade and be a thought partner in any project of your choosing.)",

Some features just have too much impedance mismatch with the \"debugger way\". They'd be orders of magnitude simpler to support if you just dump a trace of an execution and browse it after the fact. You lose the ability to change programs when they hit an error. But I don't see too many people using debuggers like that either.",

So?\nPC: We scanned all of github\nMe: K, sounds a little useful but like Steve said searching on github sucks, why is yours better\nPC: We can scan your entire company's projects so you can find usage and code\nMe: Okay, that might be useful if I worked at a company but at the moment I'm a one man band\nPC: There's a plugin for github with 27k repos scanned already\nMe: Hmm, I'll at least check that out.\n\nMan, I'm not doing a good job of explaining how my thoughts went. I don't remember where or why I switched from sceptical to interest peaked but I did. BUT.....\n\nThen I went to spread the love. I go paste links to their site and their chrome extension in another slack. I'm met with the same scepticism and I have zero ideas about how to convey anything that would get the other devs to even look. I go on the Sourcegraph site, nothing. I search for Sourcegraph vs IDEs, there's one about vs IntelliJ from stackshare. In that Intelli-j trounces sourcegraph (it's a popularity contest though)\n\nThe idea of write once use everywhere is appealing to the engineer in me but I only use a couple of editors in every day use.\n\nThey really need a \"why sourcegraph is better than your IDE\" page with concrete examples of where sourcegraph did something I actually need to do. When I was on the chromium team their code search (<https:\/\/cs.chromium.org\/>) was super useful but I'm not working on anything that big at the moment.\n\nSo, \"why sourcegraph is better than my IDE?\"\n\nand, for the browser plugin, what are some concrete examples of things I would actually do with it?",

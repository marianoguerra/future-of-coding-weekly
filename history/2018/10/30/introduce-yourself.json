        "text": "Hey everyone! I just finished catching up on Steve’s podcast, which is how I found this group. I discovered the podcast while researching folks who were teaching Elm as a first programming language. The first episode to which I listened was Professor Anand’s interview, and it remains one of my favorites. In the last couple years, I’ve become very involved in the Elm community, and I’m excited about its potential as a tool to teach programming.\n\nI’m a based in Chicago. Currently, I’m not working on anything worth promoting. I just wrapped up some experiments with a BEAM backend for the Elm compiler, which may be interesting to some folks here: <https:\/\/kofi.sexy\/blog\/elm-beam>. At this point, I’m primarily here to learn more about the work happening in this area. I’m also open to opportunities to transition my own career in that direction. Looking forward to great conversations!",

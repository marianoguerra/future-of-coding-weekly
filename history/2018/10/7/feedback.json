I think my sub problem is useful by itself but not to people at parties. Basically any technical subproblem would fit that description. That's why I feel like I need to zoom out a bit. However, I agree with you on being more specific. Maybe I simply say I'm building a fully customizable email app (and keep quiet on the fact that you'll be able to build any web app with it)",

I think this is widely applicable advice: _\"Better to start with an overly narrow description of your project than try to describe it in its full generality and lose the audience completely.\"_ -- <http:\/\/www.ycombinator.com\/howtoapply>\n\nThere's also the question of tailoring your description to the specific party you're at. But we all wrestle with that..\n\nHow would you answer my Gmail question? To me there's no way to get someone like Gmail to adopt an entire new approach that reduces their power over users without first showing an alternative and demonstrating adoption. Show people a new thing that's more desirable than the old thing.\n\n(Also, app stores are particularly challenging; you can't really build a powerful programmable app atop either Android or iOS. Thinking about mobile is inevitably depressing to me. If you have thoughts on how to use existing app stores I'm all ears.)",

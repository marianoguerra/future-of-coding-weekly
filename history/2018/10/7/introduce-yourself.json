        "text": "Hi all, I'm Jeremy, currently based in London where I am working for a Fintech. I have spent a lot of time recently thinking about topics related to this field and I plan to spend a growing amount of my time exploring the question of whether these ideas can be brought to life. Just like everyone else, I do not know what exactly this might turn into. My academic background is in maths and I have always had an interest in computers, and particularly the visual usage of these.\n\nAn example of what frustrated (frustrates) me growing up was walking around a video game world complete with environment, characters etc. and not having any control to modify or create any of the game myself, without going back to 'square 1' so to speak. I look forward to following the conversations as they develop here.\n\nP.S. I found this community through Steve's post on 'A Visual History of Eve' (<https:\/\/futureofcoding.org\/essays\/eve\/>).",

Surely it’s not complete, and not phrased in the best way. \nSome of these principles will seem odd to you, and you might have different opinions about them. That’s where I‘m looking forward to discussion, not to tell you why I’m right and you’re wrong, but to find out together why we value different things, and how that can help us to learn from each other. We might discover that we want to build different tools for different domains and different audiences. That’s good; there is a lot of value in diversity. \n<https:\/\/gist.github.com\/stefanlesser\/ab0cc5a18baa37ad7b4cda63410ed554>",

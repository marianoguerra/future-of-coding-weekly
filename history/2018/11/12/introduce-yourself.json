        "text": "Aloha, everyone! A few years ago, I co-founded a company with the specific mission of reinventing the development experience. On the practical side, this means that we build a new kind of an IDE called the Glamorous Toolkit. However, our main focus is on the human behavior, and as we build our environment, we create several new techniques. We call the overall approach moldable development based on the idea that the environment must adapt to the context of our system. I can say that I now program fundamentally different than I did 5 years ago.\n\nGlamorous Toolkit is implemented in Pharo and it comes with a complete graphical stack that has some interesting properties. For example, it includes a live documentation and notebook technology right in the IDE. We reached a first alpha version a couple of months ago. I'd love to talk about it and other people's experience. Some details can be found here: <https:\/\/feenk.com\/gt>",

Like a feel like being able to put a bunch of shapes in a list List&lt;Shape&gt; where concrete shapes are Circle, Rectangle, Triangle, etc is a useful concept. Or that semi standard command pattern that's useful for apps and gives you nearly free undo, redo, scripting language integration, etc.. I don't really know a better way. Another example might be some IO\/stream API where I want to pass in some abstract concept of a stream and that stream might be file, it might be a zip file, etc, it might be some in memory file, etc...\n\nBut I certainly agree OOP can be overused and it's certainly frustrating to have factory factory factories etc.\n\nI just sometimes don't know what the alternative is. For example functional programming doesn't seem like an alternative to all problems. Somethings actually have state and can't easily be duplicated\/discarded\/GCed automagically. Files and GPU resources come to mind but it's certainly possible I'm just aware of the patterns that deal with that fact outside of stateful objects.",

        "text": "The problem with OOP is that it facilitates having more state (the only significant difference between OOP and FP is that objects provide a namespace to hang state variables off of). State is the largest source of unexpected results in programing. It means functions can have unexpected side effects (by modifying state), and it also means the surface area for bugs gets increase by an order of magnitude (each function in your class now needs needs be tested with all significant permutations its instance variables can be in). When you do need to have state OOP is a useful (the best?) paradigm for managing it. Gary Bernhardt's \"Boundaries\" is a great talk on when and how to use OOP and FP in the same application <https:\/\/www.destroyallsoftware.com\/talks\/boundaries>",

To achieve this, the focus was on cleaning the system to modularize the tiny bits that can be recreated later on. The two are not far apart, but there is more visible momentum around Pharo.",

Morphic, which was originally invented in Self, is an exciting vehicle to show how combining a graphical framework with a reflective system can produce live environments that allow us to both make computation available for people and allow us to drill down into the system. Now, Morphic shows its 20+ years. For example, it renders things via BitBlt. We build another graphical stack that brings the Morphic ideas into a more modern form, and also takes advantage of what is possible today. For example, it has exactly one rendering tree at all times. Based on this property, we think we created a novel text editor that is able to incorporate arbitrary graphical elements. This in turn enables us to have a live notebook technology right in the IDE.",

Or, rather the question is can we bring managed time to distributed, concurrent actors? Reading the Managed Time paper, it sure seems so. The Virtual Time paper linked from the Managed Time paper you linked above definitely looks like it is extending the actor model rather than working beneath it. From the paper: \"Processes communicate only by exchanging messages, and any process is free at any time to send a message to any process (including itself) that it can name.\"\n\nWhat I'm looking for is something more than 'trace and record entire executions'. E.g. we may want to explore two alternative executions and then commit to one, or merge them. We may want to do this as part of live programming, or even as part of maintaining consistency in a distributed system.",

Exploring two possible executions can be done by just running two slightly different systems in parallel (or doing rewind-resume); it doesn't seem like it would benefit greatly from any special concepts. I think the conversation has gone on a tangent?",

Could we get the same benefits for large, distributed systems as well? Anyway, this is probably not a great medium for this discussion further. I hope to write up some more detail at some point.",

And it sounds natural -- designer is a limited human being and can't predict the future.\n\nSo support of legacy code and eventual compatability break are inevitable pain.\n\nHow can we minimize this pain, make transitions between different generations of code more smooth?\n\nOne idea is than we should focus on developing proper interface for building blocks. Independent building blocks allow to migrate code slowly, without painful total rewrite.\n\nGood example of such building block is docker. As long as container communicates through sockets in same way, we can totally rewrite what's inside.\n\nShould we invent a convenient building block, similar to docker container, but smaller? Something easier to compose. Library with C FFI is somewhat similar, but they are unsafe to use.",

Really amazing to finally chat! <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DuMdDXCMDk0>\n\nFor reference on what we talked about, here are the notes I took from the convo:\n```\n* first computer experience when he was 18\n* studying engineering in India in college\n* before he found computers, he was going to do MBA and be business guy\n* UT Austin PhD in computer systems (compiler and micro architecture)\n  * wanted to re-think *all* the assumptions from the ground up based on what we know about compilers\n  * as well as the other direction, redesigning compilers based on ISA architectures\n  * it was all very theoretical because nobody was going to use it, because backwards-compatibility has force. who's going to invest in a new processor?\n  * we're in a x86-mono culture\n* and then Bay area ever since\n* my idea of convervatism is don't change things because we don't know why they work: Chesterton's fence. You can't tear it down until you tell me why it was erected in the first place.\n  * threading the needle: refactoring a legacy code base with tests and refactoring slowly, incrementalism\n* legacy is code no person on your team understands\n* he's not an IDE programmer, just a text editor guy... love how he says this outright up front\n* all the things you do to see if your code works after you right it is lost unless you encode as a test\n* joined Google in 2010 and was disheartening to see how the meat was made\n* the code at Google was shit despite great engineers, because it was passed through hands\n* law of software: suckage increases over time\n* all langauges (python 3, perl 6) go through period of backwards incompatible changes\n* big course corrections are a sign of a big mistake\n* also applies to countries: USA, Rome\n  * coleen mccoulogh historical fiction novels about rome: the first man in Rome\n* but the decay in software is not entropy\n  * it's more like complexity creep, which is quite similar to law creep\n* the deepness in the sky - one of his favorite sci fi books with real programmers\n* code runs on the trunk but there should be lot more forking activity....\n```",

Having a cursor and being able to easily jump between definitions\/usages would be great. Since whitespace doesnt matter, I could think of a cursor that selects tokens\/words instead of characters. Thanks for the link to `ctags`, I wasn't aware of it.\nThis is unrelated to the \"documentation owned by everyone\" idea, but I think both are worth looking into.\n\"Growing\" ideas seems important to me. I've tried to create an AST-based code editor for Python (<https:\/\/github.com\/fkohlgrueber\/vrite>) before but failed because it turned out to be much harder than I thought. Starting with a small subproblem (viewing instead of editing, terminal instead of HTML, ... in my case) and expanding the scope once you've got it right seems to be a good way to approach hard problems.",

They start out great and they gradually suck more and more over time.\" (Kartik, 30:30)\n- Entropy and decay don’t apply to software like they do to bridges for example (Kartik, 36:30).\n- “We need to find a way to periodically reduce complexity …” (Kartik, 36:45)\n- “Software is not really like anything we’ve seen before” (Kartik, 39:30)\n- “No matter what better system I come up with or you come up with, it’ll have to go through breaking changes and eventually someone will come up with something so much better that it will die.” (Steve, 41:45)",

If you can't make arbitrary changes to it, it becomes a vector for complexity creep. I think most of the bloat in modern stacks comes from interfaces growing monotonically more complex.

Is that the best set of interfaces possible, or can we reorganize to some smaller set of interfaces? That would transfer more of the problem to the 'easy' side.\n\nb) Right now the interfaces on my system are the same as the interfaces on yours. Is that really necessary? Does my laptop _really_ need the latest hyper-optimizations for http added by Google to serve 2% more requests per dollar per watt in their data centers? Even worse, does the software on my laptop really need layers and layers of compatibility for processors it will never ever encounter?\n\nMy goal is not a rigid system. My goal is a _rewrite-friendly_ system, one where you don't pay for what you don't use.

        "text": "I would add that interface changes rarely remove support for previously supported use-cases. Most breaking changes are just because you have to do things differently. In these cases, you could use tooling that automatically upgrades your code to use the new interface.\nIf an interface changes, all uses of it need to change as well. There might be no way around this. But what you could do is to make the upgrade process as smooth as possible. I suspect that given the right tools, 90% of backwards-incompatible changes could be resolved automatically.\nInterfaces are a very wide field and it's hard to give a general answer. Do you have specific tricky interfaces in mind?",

        "text": "&gt;&gt; As far as I'm concerned, \"like reality\" is absolutely what this is about: \"programming is casting spells over reality\", even if that reality is generated by machines. It's about the perception of the person doing the programming being met well enough.\n\n&gt;It's a two-sided problem as described in this Bret Victor photo: <http:\/\/worrydream.com\/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign\/Images\/Tool2.png> (26 kB)\n&gt;I'm arguing that the \"part that fits the person\" doesn't need to be that closely related to the \"part that fits the problem\". We have some flexibility here.\n\nWell if the handle is the \"What\" of programming (thus declaratively in my preference) and the head is the \"How\" (the imperative machinery of the computer), then I think everything about the How part can and should be hidden away, on its way to achieving the human visible or interactable What. So I think that much we can agree. Our \"spells over reality\" are the What; the handle. Our perception of success is What-like, reality-like, in the terms of the reality our spells are intended to influence. All the hidden mechanism - the How - is still \"real\", sure, but we both agree can be hidden complexity. So maybe we agree?\n\n&gt;&gt; I don't like streams or event streams or anything that forces natural models of reality into a theoretical straitjacket. My mother doesn't see a stream of events around her: she sees changing state!\n\n&gt;Your mother also doesn't see the equations for the laws of physics but they are the best way to *model* reality (that we have discovered so far). They are the best tool for the job for understanding and predicting reality. That's the key -- not to simply defer to what people already have in their brains but to build a powerful tool to extend their capabilities, which will require them to grow what's in their brains to meet the \"tool\" halfway.\n\nObviously kids don't have to learn the laws of physics in order to quickly get started building a fun game in something like Roblox or Minecraft. Which is re-use or library territory: they can implement their own physics laws one day, but for now, just re-use this pre-packaged knowledge. I think we should not ask too much of people - the tools\/language\/IDE\/pre-created libraries should do everything they can to meet the non-technical person who's programming in their own terms, building on what they already know.\n\nAnd what they already know is that there's the familiar states of things, and those states change in familiar behavioural ways. So allow them to declare states, attach pre-packaged behaviours and extend those behaviours with new ones.",

For example, the other night I felt like I was getting sick. I didn't know. It was all hidden inside me. Turns out it was just a blip. I have no idea why. Reality is quite opaque for a lot of questions. Software has the potential to be *infinitely* understandable and *infinitely* customizable* - why settle for the meagerness of reality?\n\nI'm sorry, but I don't get this point! If there's state that's hidden, then it's not part of our reality over which we want to cast our magic programs. The meagerness of reality is what people want to animate with their magic. Not sure I get where you're going with the *infinitely* part.. ?\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; *composability* is a really important property, and it's hindered by global state.\n\n&gt;&gt; Not if you structure your global state - the web is composed very well, thanks!\n\n&gt;This is only because the web as global state is just static pages. The web doesn't have dynamic global state, where one web page can modify another page's state. That's maintained by ugly HTTP plumbing code on the side.\n\nWell, funny you should describe that concept, as that's related to how the Object Network works, except that Object Net Objects can't modify each other: they are masters of their own state, and depend on the states around them in the web\/net of Objects, no ugly pipework, just declarative rules.",

        "text": "Hello everyone.  I am middle age woman who had many directions in life from studying math to becoming a visual artist, stage director and actress. Recently I am self educating myself on programming and facing the problem that I feel a lot of people will be facing since getting into “knowing” what to do with a computer and in the computer is unavoidable. There is a need of thinking in more abstract terms that would allow learning through common logic of human mind rather than education done in unfamiliar to non-computer oriented mind language that describes another unknown language that talks to unknown and sometime “scary” beast - computer. Languages I have learn so far are Javascript, Elixir, Python, (html,css ), some Golang. While I am introducing myself to languages I am growing in understanding on difficulties and trying to bring into my mind solutions how things could be explained in more “human terms” and logic. I hope participating in this group will introduce new paths for people to cross the gap from not knowing into knowing what to do and how to approach computer programming.  ",

        "text": "<@UDCLT064X> That’s interesting! Typically what happens is the reverse (people going from curl to Postman because they couldn’t get curl to work). We also have a curl importer that tries to translate the command into a Postman request. Could you ask her to try that? Over the past 5 years of building Postman, I have realized that debugging an API call is actually a pretty hard problem with so many layers of technology involved. I read Mindstorms a while back and been trying to use that to guide users on how they can better understand what’s going on and peel these layers back.",

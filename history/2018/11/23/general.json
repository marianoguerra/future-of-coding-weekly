                "text": "Annette Vee was visiting in Ann Arbor, and looked me up. We had coffee and a great conversation.&nbsp; Annette is an English Professor who teaches Composition at University of Pittsburgh (see website here). She published a book last year with MIT Press,&nbsp;Coding Literacy: How Computer Programming is Changing Writing. (I&rsquo;m part way through it and recommend it!)&nbsp;She knew me from this blog and my other writing about computational literacy. I was thrilled to meet someone who makes the argument for code-as-literacy with a real claim to understanding&nbsp;literacy.\nOne of the themes in our conversation was the distinction between literature and composition.&nbsp; (I&rsquo;m going to summarize something we were talking about &mdash; Annette is not responsible for me getting things wrong here.) Literature is about doing writing very&nbsp;well, about writing great works that stand the test of time. It&rsquo;s about understanding and emulating greater writers.&nbsp; Composition is about writing&nbsp;well for communication.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s about letters to Grandma, and office memos, and making your emails effective.&nbsp; Composition is about writing understandable prose, not great prose as in literature. People in literature sometimes look down on those in composition.\nThere&rsquo;s a similar distinction to be made between computer science as it&rsquo;s taught in Universities and what Annette and I are calling coding\/computational literacy (but which might be what Aman Yadav and Shuchi Grover are calling computational thinking).&nbsp; Computer science aims to prepare people to engineer complex, robust, and secure systems that work effectively for many users. Computational literacy is about people using code to communicate, to express thoughts, and to test ideas. This code doesn&rsquo;t have to be pretty or robust. It certainly shouldn&rsquo;t be complex, or nobody will do it. It should be secure, but that security should probably be built into the programming system rather than expecting to teach people about it (as Ben Herold recently talked about).&nbsp; People in computer science will likely look down on those teaching computational literacy or computational thinking. That&rsquo;s okay.\nFew people will write literature. Everyone will compose.",

Mostly because I believe aesthetic can be a shortcut to describe something (functionally) useful without fully understanding why it is useful. Well, I subscribe to Steve Jobs’ “Design is how it works” definition of design too, so that might be important context. And as far as I can understand, that excludes all the cases where aesthetics don’t serve a higher purpose and have a contribution to form or usefulness.\n\nI guess what I’m saying is that as humans I hope were somehow wired to perceive greatness through aesthetics as a shortcut. But then just looking at the design of many products on the market it’s clearly a skill that is not evenly distributed…",

        "text": "<@U85HCL7JP> to answer your question, I like the analogy in your post. It's kinda similar to (though not subsumed by or isomorphic to) one I've been making for a couple of years:\n\nProgramming literacy is about being able to reason critically about an arbitrary program, and about being able to compare and contrast two programs (functions) that do similar things.\n\nThis analogy seems to work in a couple of ways:\n\nWe often learn to read by practicing writing. But that's just part of the process. _What_ you have written is irrelevant by the time you gain literacy.\n\nI'd like to live in a world where most people are literate by this definition. They can't write an OS (novel), but they do _read_ OSs every once in a while when they need to. (Unfortunately, I think _nobody_ is literate by this definition today. All some of us programmer-priests can do easily is read programs we ourselves wrote. Not too long ago. It's because we're writing in the equivalent of Roman numerals, and then struggling to read it back, tongues sticking out.)\n\n_(This builds on my earlier comment at <https:\/\/futureprogramming.slack.com\/archives\/C5U3SEW6A\/p1542223799068500?thread_ts=1542220667.062400.>)_",

        "text": "<@U5STGTB3J> One addendum on analogies: analogies are great for quickly painting a picture to someone who's utterly new to something. Giving an analogy for programming to a non-programmer is useful, because it can get a lot communicated very quickly. If it's misleading in a few places that's fine. We can elaborate if we need to.\n\nHowever, I've found analogies to be poor ways to try to persuade people of something opposite their own beliefs. I've tried to justify the direction I take in my research by making analogies with past historical events, movements, etc. And they've all uniformly bombed.\n\nThis may be obvious, but it took me a certain amount of head-butting to realize..",

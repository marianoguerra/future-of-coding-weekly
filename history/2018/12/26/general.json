The whole aspect of readability is part and parcel of debugging, especially when you imagine someone other than the original author trying to upgrade\/repair a big system. The difficulty of understanding a large system is a major problem in software today. Software lasts decades, and goes through many hands typically, and the handover from the original author to the new maintainers is a very tricky handoff. My actual supreme goal in beads is to create an era of interchangeable parts, where people can share code effectively. Right now, the GitHub repository is more of a graveyard to me than a useful resource. The number of projects with tangled dependencies, unknown debugging state, and a mishmash of different coding technologies makes it pretty useless for my purposes. I am sure others can sing the praises, but these large repositories are clearly not working that well. Why are the software as a service companies like Facebook, Salesforce, etc., able to charge such vast sums if programs were easy to make out of available parts.",

We do not want to comprehend in general and as a whole, but enough to be able to affect a change. This is called decision making. Given that we spend most of our time doing that (making decisions about what to do next), 9 years ago I started to look at software engineering as being primarily a decision making business. I developed a theory and an associated method that I am validating in industrial case studies every since. You can read about it at <http:\/\/humane-assessment.com>. More recently we went a step further and created a whole IDE that is based on the idea that assessment should be supported first class.",

When I paint a painting, I'm not going to get feedback from my audience (or any buyers) until after the painting is done. Some painters might benefit from getting that feedback throughout the creative process. Most (myself included) would surely find it stifling.\n\nPoint: It is at least _conceivable_ that there are benefits to the _lack_ of immediate feedback when programming. It'd be interesting to try to spitball what those benefits might be. It requires a broader sense of \"feedback\" than just \"does it compile and what does it do when run?\", which is of course a broader sense than the one <@U8A5MS6R1> intended, but worth considering because we're all here exploring that broader space.",

Let's instead look for benefits of not having feedback, rather than costs of having it, or at least look for \"the feedback might not be helpful when you really consider what the feedback is actually telling you\"",

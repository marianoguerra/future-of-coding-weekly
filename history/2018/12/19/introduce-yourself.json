I'm an untrained, uneducated freelance web dev in Tennessee who, about 3 years ago, thought: \"wouldn't be cool if you could actually see programs?\"  Since then I've discovered Fred Brooks, Bret Victor, VISSOFT, and, well, Computer Science in general.  And recently, <@U5TCAFTD3> and the community he has begun to catalogue and connect!  Hats off to you.  My initial goal has refined, but is largely unchanged: create massive visualizations of software behaviour for experienced workaday programmers.  My current stab looks like this:\n\nTarget language: JavaScript (preferable ES6)\nAnalysis method: instrumentation and dynamic analysis\nDrawing: WebGL\nTarget elements of software behaviour: data flow within control flow",

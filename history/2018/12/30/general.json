The problem is, although it's easier to read for non-programmers and English speakers in general, it's hard to write because you end up in an uncanny valley where English grammar rules and simpler imperative programming language rules get confused.

It's related to what you describe as 'visibility' - the whole composition is immediately updated and visible when the paint goes on the canvas (at least from the current perspective). Imagine painting through a peephole, only seeing a part of the painting and having to imagine the full composition. In the specific aspect of *visibility* at least, it seems one full composition should be always visible when being updated.\nOnto programming.. the code if visible and updated live, but code isn't the full composition. The full composition is some behavior spread out over time and within a slice of all possibilities. We imagine it (human simulating the machine) and it is not visible in the editing medium. I think it's the idea of reducing\/eliminating mental simulation of the computer that I find more important than 'feedback'.\n\n&gt; we should choose what sorts of that feedback we really want,\nFully agree with this. I think choice of 'viewing perspective' should be natural in the future medium of programming - one simply cannot process all possible perspectives available anyway.",

I'd like to draw a distinction between text as a user interface and text files as a storage\/versioning format. Note that spreadsheets are text heavy user interfaces but poorly supported by so called 'text oriented' tools such as Git. Specifically in files there's the notion of a structure built on *lines* of text. It's a very hard ceiling in the current ecosystem. Even if we say 'text is great as programming language', we don't have to accept 'large blobs of text' are the best storage format (e.g. you could parse and store\/version a graph structure, or store individual cells, etc.). I have a couple of write-ups specifically around plain text files starting here: <https:\/\/shalabh.com\/programmable-systems\/plain-text.html>",

You often need to spend some time away from the painting, and come back to it later \"with fresh eyes\" to properly appreciate the _meaning_ of any changes you made. Same with music — when I'm working on a song, I'm in a very particular mindset, one which is not amenable to appreciating whether or not the music is _any good_. The sort of feedback I get from throwing some additional paint on the canvas, or tweaking a melodic progression, is akin to checking whether my tests are passing — I can tell whether the things I've done are _correct_ or _erroneous_, but I can't actually _run_ the painting or _run_ the music to appreciate whether it _works the way I intended_ until after some time has passed.\n\nMy point is that.. when we programmers talk about immediacy, we love the example of artists getting immediate feedback. But I contend that it's a faulty comparison. Artists don't get immediate feedback about the most important part of their work: whether the work is effective or not. They do get immediate feedback about _some_ technical \/ mechanical aspects, though even this doesn't hold for some art forms, like pottery, where you need to bake the clay in a kiln before you know if it even survives that part of the process.",

        "text": "Without giving it all that much thought, I think the sort of immediacy we're looking for is what you get in improvisation. When you're playing improv games, jamming\/soloing, free dancing, etc.. you are going straight from action through to final result, with no stop in the middle for editing or reflection, and no tolerance for any part of the process imposing a delay. Now, one might counter \"well, programming is of course going to have the opportunity for editing, since it's not performative\" — but look at the tools used for live coding! They are designed to be used in a performative way, and they often have a great story around liveness\/immediacy, because they _have to_. I think there's a stronger link between liveness\/immediacy and improv than the one we're trying to draw between liveness and other kinds of art. So when we're craving more interactivity and rich feedback from the computer, and we're looking longingly at artists, I think we might want to focus on improv art forms in particular, since they seem to be the only art forms that have a rapid feedback cycle by necessity. If we all start emulating painting, we're probably going to end up emulating the wrong kinds of liveness. (Why? Well, imagine if we emulated pottery)",

Text editors do parse homogenized byte arrays into richer structures. They partially (and poorly) duplicate functionality already implemented in the language parsers. Why is this pervasive reimplementation needed? Can we have a storage substrate that can preserve the rich structures instead of homogenizing them and then having to globally distribute the parsing knowledge out of band?",

There's been times in programming when the next morning I realize I was moving correctly but in the wrong direction. I'm wondering how one could get a sense of something being effective.\n\nImprov forms are interesting because there's the back-and-forth conversational aspect. Even live compiler feedback is more like a partner that only responds with 'yes' or 'no'. Perhaps richer responses are possible if instead of submitting whole programs, we build incrementally by sending one message at a time and the computer responding with a wide range of possibilities for us to explore next.",

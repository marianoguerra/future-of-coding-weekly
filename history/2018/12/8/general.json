Apart from that this talk is really well done and entertaining, it also provides a great framing for pretty much all the discussions going on here.\nLet’s make sure we never believe we know what we’re doing!\n<https:\/\/vimeo.com\/71278954>",

Ok, I think I get the gist of it, but I’m having a hard time to figure out what the point is you’re trying to make by referencing to it?\n\nSo hacker culture (btw: what is the definition of that in the context of that article?) prevents us from making progress and as Bret hacked together some demos, which obviously show his “wizard-level skillz“, he's contradicting himself…? Or what is it that you mean by “smell the smell”? Clearly, I’m not smelling it. Please enlighten me!",

        "text": "\"Artists know that self-aggrandizing technique is a lie.\"  Perhaps the best.  Though hacker ego is *a* problem, systems seem to suck even when people are trying their best to get things done straightforwardly.  Even humble cleverness is a curse when your team has the skill to navigate and patch awful, broken systems.  Maybe garbage collection (\"going to have to throw stuff away\") could help.  Was tutoring in CS recently.  So disappointed to see programming projects right out of the 90s – all the worse of C and UNIX.  Sins of the fathers and all that.",

        "text": "<@U5STGTB3J> Yeah, it is a bit tough to puzzle out, it took me a few years. The point <@U6KQ2S410> was making was about what Bret never talks about - what he doesn't talk about is loss. If we are in the mission of democratising programming (or whatever we call it), ultimately we are in the game of transferring power from those who currently have it, towards those who are currently disempowered. What's missing from Bret's narrative is any downside for anyone - it's all rainbows and unicorns and inspiring stuff - which, we have to note, is why Bret is allowed to get away with having such a high profile for a \"revolutionary\" - because he is actually fundamentally unthreatening to those who currently hold the power (intellectual and corporate elites). Don't get me wrong - he is a smart and well-intentioned guy, and he has God's own reading list, and, if we are taking the mainstream of computer science as a starting point, he is clearly setting out in the right direction. It's just that he is not going to get us where we need to go, because ultimately no transfer of power is going to happen under his watch. We always have to bear in mind that when we are truly confronting power, things are going to get a bit ugly - power is never transferred without a struggle. In practice a lot of the systems we are going to end up building are going to look pretty undesirable to a lot of people who currently carry a lot of respect - if we are doing it right. The point isn't about skills or the lack of them, but about the trajectory of deploying those skills - what does the place we're trying to get to look like?",

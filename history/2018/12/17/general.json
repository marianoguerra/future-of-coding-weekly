Likewise, I'm waiting for a really good game with straight edge and compass constructions.  (Geometry is geometry for its own reasons, not because it makes a good game.  So there's a gap there.)  Mario physics certainly don't have much to do with the world, but they have a internal consistency and lovely feel.  Speaking of which, <@UC2A2ARPT> I always felt good platformers often have a nice groupish dynamic: waiting for platforms to synchronize.  When talking with those who don't \"get Mario games,\" I like to share Mark Brown's analysis of Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JqHcE6B4OP4>.",

It turns out though that all the puzzles there follow basic Newtonian optics.  And if you actually write out the lines and such – well, it's a bit of an Easter-egg.",

These days, I'm working on 200%ing so to speak.  The Witness consists of a series of levels of abstraction, spheres if will – spheres with spheres, bubbles in a stream.  There are six worlds <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mysterium_Cosmographicum.>  The first two give you explicit rewards, that makes 100%.  After that, none: this isn't Fez.  The first is a tutorial for the second.  The second is a tutorial for the third.  Jonathan Blow has talked about the three levels and alluded to others.  They're on prominently display on the walls of the\nMonastery.  The third level is made from perspective Easter eggs.  In the fourth, the previous three levels combine into vignettes.  The fifth is a grand epic.  It includes the history of the world.  And the sixth is unattainable.",

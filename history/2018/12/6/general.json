I can never transcribe talks in real time and am always amazed by stenographers - I believe they even have to use special stenotype keyboards.\n\nThe ambiguity aspect is important. I think that depends more on the language design than on the input mechanism (speaking to program doesn't have to use plain English).\n\nI feel exploring this space opens up many other aspects not related to speaking as well. E.g. programming could be more conversational (back and forth) rather than write-everything-up-and-submit dissertation style. Perhaps expressing some ambiguity and then resolving it becomes important.",

        "text": "Or you may end up creating functions with lots of optional args for hooks to influence their behavior.\n\nFunctions would end up being large and doing more to make hooks economic.\n\nSo that's two more 'rules of taste' being violated. I'm sure there'll be others.\n\nAll these violations seem like a red flag. Code should be malleable. Making code immutable feels like abuse, going against the grain of its fundamental nature.\n\nMaybe there's value is making certain timeless functions immutable and giving them hashes. Substring search? Blowfish? Especially if you're providing some hard-to-provide property like resistance to timing attacks. But _true_ timelessness is really hard. Even with substring search you end up caring about how strings are represented. Length-prefixed? Null-terminated? You also have the problem of picking the right platform to represent a timeless function in. None of our existing platforms seem good enough. Maybe we need a new VM that lots of new languages build on and share a vocabulary over. Maybe WebAssembly is that platform?\n\nIt may also make sense in a more restricted environment where users can't create first-class functions. Like say a library of stored procedures in your database. But at that point it seems more like an implementation detail of one particular system.",

        "text": "I don't see immutability as against malleability because all we are really saying is the specific version is immutable, but new versions are possible. E.g. a git repo uses immutable chunks but is still an evolving system. We really want something like git that tracks functions and types directly (instead of tracking files), if I understand <@UDJ2TKB99> correctly. The cross-function links would point to specific versions of functions (not just to a function by name), so if you commit a new version of a function F@2, nothing really changes, but you can then selectively\/automatically commit new versions of dependent functions to point to your new version F@2 instead of F@1. Separately you'd want this as single global auto-replicated repository that everyone can commit to because updates don't interfere with each other by default, people chose which updates affect their `main` functions.\n\nThe more interesting question is: do we want functions and types as the unit of update - or something finer\/coarser grained? The OAP uses the term 'expression' but doesn't say what exactly this is.",

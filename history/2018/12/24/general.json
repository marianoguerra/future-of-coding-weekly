        "text": "half of the people in this group, when they think of \"future of coding\", imagine more convenient, more grpahically interactive IDE environments, where you use drag and drop mechanisms, and extrapolate from autocompletion to not just a word but a phrase. Others imagine more robust languages which free the programmer from the drudgery of debugging, which some estimate takes 85% of all programming time. A lot of people over-estimate the time it takes to enter the code, and under estimate the time it takes to get it working perfectly. I would be very interested in the group members divulging what percentage they estimate of the total time making a program to be debugging.",

Most of my time — likely in excess of 80% — is spent designing and making things in the first place, and that time is spent struggling with the problem domain, not with the code I’ve written. Once I have something working, it’s rare that I ever touch that code again until I need to change or expand it to suit a new usage. There’s some non-trivial code I use daily that’s been effectively unchanged since I wrote it 4 years ago. Some horridly complex code my coworkers totally rely on that I haven’t touched since 2011. Sometimes things break and are fixed and break and are fixed, but that’s usually because I did a bad job of the initial design — this is the rare exception, in my experience. But my job\/team is not typical.\n\nFWIW, I’m solidly in the “graphically interactive” camp. And the things I make tend to be visible or audible or in some other way nakedly apparent whether they’re working correctly or not. If I make a mistake, it’s almost immediately apparent what and where and why. (Perhaps this is why I don’t get why people are so gaga about types)",

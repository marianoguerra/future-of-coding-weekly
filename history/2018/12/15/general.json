There's a mental tension when things aren't done, relieved by a simplifying or cleaning up process. Maybe I'm not expressing that well: anyone else know what I'm getting at? :blush:",

He's medium interested.  (Needs a few more days.)  Doesn't cohere as well as Monument valley.  The effects of actions are more arbitrary.  He found matching inverted color tiles as intuitive as matching -c with c.  It's a little too constrained, goal directed to be interesting.  Their DragonBox's Numbers game is better in that it has more a bit more freedom.  Currently Gorogoa is his favorite for its non-chronological narrative structure.  Those of you with little kids will be all too familiar with how their preferences and capabilities don't match up with adult categorizations.  For example, just yesterday I'm singing \"Angels We Have Heard On High\" to myself, he joins in with excellent harmony for about a minute then switches to fire-engine siren sounds 'cus it seems like the most naturally way this song should go to him.",

What proves compelling really varies with the person and their mood.  For example, I went into playing the Witness with no background.  Hadn't even put together that Jonathan Blow was involved.  At first I was confused by the juxtaposition of puzzle panel screens in a lush impressionistic 3D world.  Seemed extraordinarily ill conceived.  (Soon enough I learned that my conception was at fault – and I learned a great many other things.)  As for \"full exploration,\" the Witness is very much like the Goldberg variations, so thorough.  (In the text, Blow says as much by deeply hiding two paths of puzzles that end in literal dead-ends, \"I thought of trying this and this, but these concepts didn't really go that far.\")  Even Stephen's Sausage Roll, which starts extremely strong, loses coherence by the end.  Of course, it's much harder and more complicated than the Witness.  The Witness not only strips away frills but having chosen a relatively small space of possible games, Blow does a remarkable job of touring it.  Each of the few hundred puzzles says something, communicates, a language without words per se, a meditation on first Philosophy really starting from more basic basics.",

In the first place, I must shove against an atmosphere pressing with a force of fourteen pounds on every square inch of my body. I must make sure of landing on a plank traveling at twenty miles a second round the sun — a fraction of a second too early or too late, the plank would be miles away. I must do this whilst hanging from a round planet head outward into space, and with a wind of aether blowing at no one knows how many miles a second through every interstice of my body. The plank has no solidity of substance. To step on it is like stepping on a swarm of flies. Shall I not slip through? No, if I make the venture one of the flies hits me and gives a boost up again; I fall again and am knocked upwards by another fly; and so on. I may hope that the net result will be that I remain about steady, but if, unfortunately, I should slip through the floor or be boosted too violently up to the ceiling, the occurrence would be, not a violation of the laws of Nature, but a rare coincidence. These are some of the minor difficulties. I ought really to look at the problem four-dimensionally as concerning the intersection of my world-line with that of the plank. Then again, it is necessary to determine in which direction the entropy of the world is increasing in order to make sure that my passage over the threshold is an entrance, not an exit. Verily, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a scientific man to pass through a door. And whether the door be barn door or church door it might be wiser that he should consent to be an ordinary man and walk in rather than wait till all the difficulties involved in a really scientific ingress are resolved.\"",

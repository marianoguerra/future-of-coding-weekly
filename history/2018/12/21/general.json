        "text": "Have people here given much consideration to structured concurrency? I haven't spent a huge amount of time writing multithreaded\/async code, and so hadn't given it much thought. I apologise if this is all old news to many of you...\n\nI came across this article that makes a strong case that most of our current primitives have a similar effect on flow control to `goto`. It then presents the analogous solution. (N.B. others have named the same concept different things - `bundle`, `scope`, `nursery`, maybe others...). Notably this approach would seem to map to visual representation far more easily than promises\/arbitrary thread spawning\/...\n\n<https:\/\/vorpus.org\/blog\/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful>\n\nFor related links, including to videos on the topic, see <http:\/\/250bpm.com\/blog:137>\n\nAside: the term 'structured' seems too generic for what people actually mean. AFAICT, in the context here\/of `goto`s, 'structured' always means 'hierarchically structured', despite other types of structure existing.",

Some compilers would auto-parallelize (via SIMD\/SSE) the statements in your example, as it's trivially provable that they are order-independent.\n\nMore complex sections of code may not be so trivial to prove, for which better language constructs may provide a solution. e.g. functions that are known to be pure can be more aggressively optimised than procedures with side effects.\n\nThat said, I am yet to be convinced that 'low-level' concerns such as ordering will be made completely obsolete. At the very least they will be needed in the implementation of higher-level languages, and for the foreseeable future in performance-heavy applications, where the programmer's domain-specific knowledge allows them to optimise by not having to provide for the general case.\n\nA completely order-independent language would certainly provide benefits, but there are also costs to losing access to the low-level. The benefits may well outweigh the costs for many use-cases, but the costs should be considered as well.\n\nJonathan Blow, re his language JAI, talks about how he wants it to reach for the stars (allow high level), while keeping its feet on the ground (allow low-level).\n\nThe threading approach in the linked article seems to be a case of 'better abstraction', rather than 'more abstraction' - you get the benefits without losing your previous level of control. These are the types of approach that I am most hopeful for.",

It's aimed at library APIs, but I don't see there being a large conceptual chasm between library interfaces and language interfaces.\n\nA couple of key takeaways for me:\n- interfaces can be evaluated on at least 5 metrics (granularity, redundancy, coupling, retention, flow control), which may structure thinking more productively than the single axis of low\/high-level\n- given the iterative nature of design in general, and software design in particular, it is useful to provide different levels of granularity (less work to implement, allowing broad strokes -&gt; more work to implement, but with more precise control)\n    - there should generally not be a large discontinuity  in terms of the amount more work needed to achieve the next level of granularity\n\n<https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZQ5_u8Lgvyk>",

(any resources you can point me towards?)\nExpression oriented functional programming discourages (or completely disallows) using mutation, which anecdotally seems to reduce bugs because at any place in your code mutation\/statefulness means that the things you are working with now may not be what they said there were when you started working with them, which is an opportunity for bugs. In expression-oriented functional programming, what you gain in confidence comes at the cost that you have to write lots of recursive code. While lots of common code is just as easy or easier to write, a few particular patterns become _a lot_ harder, namely traversing a large data structure and gathering some order-dependent information about it (which is why I gave up and hacked mutation into Elm for our project :smile: but then it’s also caused me lots of headaches, within the last week I spent half a day tracking down a bug that turned out to be because I accidentally mutated an input to a function).\n\nI realize the question was about expressions (code pieces that have a return value) vs. statements  (code pieces that do not), but the fundamental difference is mutation. Pure expressions communicate their computational result by traditional return—the expression itself evaluates to the result. Statements do not return anything, so they must communicate their result by mutation of some local or global state. So it is about mutation at the end of the day.",

        "text": "<@U5TCAFTD3> I think it's worth thinking through the implications of only wanting to democratize high-level programs. Since we don't really have a good way to build hardware that can execute recursively nested expressions, the lowest level will always execute statements that are connected by named locations. So by saying you don't want people to have to think about statements, you're asking for the lowest levels to just be \"handled\" for you. That's basically just the same priesthood arrangement we're trying to get away from, and we end up with the same questions about who watches the watchers, and so on.\n\nDemocratization is primarily a political activity, even if it happens to have some technical prerequisites that preoccupy us at the moment. Any major chasms between the front end and back end of programming lose us most of the benefit.\n\nSo you have to want people to be able to handle both statements and expressions. And compilers and OS and web frameworks and mobile apps. Luckily we can pick things up on an on-demand basis, and record the 'curriculum' in the software itself. So it's a bigger problem than you think, but not insurmountable. Except for backdoors in our processors. I have no idea how to attack _that_ problem :smile:",

Design is about working with non-linear components, so there's an ever-present danger of sub-problems being solved in unproductive ways when you return to the big picture.\n\nI'm not sure what to make of \"complexity is anti-democratic\". Feels like mixing metaphors. Complexity is far more fundamental than people or democracies. We know how to manage complexity to the extent of human needs: with hierarchy and abstraction. The way we do that isn't particularly accessible to some people over others. Hierarchy is only needed in the design, not in the organization of people working with the design. No matter what Conway's Law says.\n\nIn the end I'm not in the business of complexity for its own sake. Designing computers is a human activity for humans. If it turns out that it's bad for society to make computers faster than some threshold or miniaturized beyond some threshold that's easily verified by small groups of people -- that seems like a reason to avoid overly fast or small computers. Maybe that makes me Amish :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nI think we haven't yet seen the worst effects on society of parasitism by small groups of influential people. In nature parasites cause evolution to prefer a variety of individuals with diverse genomes. Large swathes of uniformity can seem to win for long periods but not last.

The big change that made the language nicer to use was not mutation, but hacking the core library so that any arbitrary ADT could be used inside sets or as dictionary keys—vanilla Elm artificially limits sets\/dicts to a built-in concept of “comparable” types of which your ADTs are not. And yeah, I hacked exceptions in as well for a couple special cases.\n\nBut the big consideration for starting over would not be mutation (’cuz we’ve got it now :D) but performance and tooling. I’m not sure any of the functional languages have super-great tooling, but some of them for sure have better performance than Elm. And for certain features (program synthesis search) you want the cycles. Also it’d be nice to target something other than the browser. Most likely we’ll stick with Elm but I keep contemplating starting over.\n\nRegarding GOTO: I’ve used GOTO. Good riddance. I’m sure there’s better ways to smooth out the learning curve of programming.",

All I will observe is, in an environment where the instruction pointer is materialised, GOTO counts as tangible programming :slightly_smiling_face: And on the other side, I have described the issue <@U5TCAFTD3> illustrates earlier as the \"excess sequential intention\" of imperative programming. This may sound like I am trying to talk out of both sides of my mouth, but I do believe these two points of view are actually compatible.",

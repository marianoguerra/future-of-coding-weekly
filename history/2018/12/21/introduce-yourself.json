        "text": "Hey folks, I'm Jasim and for a long time I thought that programming was just expressions, mutation, loops, and i\/o - and you had it all. \"Give me a Turing machine and I shall move mountains\" or something like that.\n\nBut one day I had enough - a Javascript framework I used at work was not performant, yet I couldn't dig down because its abstractions were opaque and non-programmable. And it was making it difficult to do my job, causing real stress. But I couldn't put my hands on what was actually wrong. Was it my lack of understanding, or had it to do with the tool itself? To get to its root I had to understand programming at a meta-level and that rabbit hole took me into CTM by Peter Van Roy, who describes it thus:\n\n&gt; We define programming, as a general human activity, to mean the act of extending or changing a system's functionality. Programming is a widespread activity that is done both by nonspecialists (eg: consumers who change the settings of their alarm clock or cellular phone) and specialists (computer programmers, the audience for this book).\n\nI see the _future of programming_ as this infinite game were things that previously needed specialists keep moving into non-specialist territory, yet the field keeps growing and constantly keeps giving birth to new specialisations.\n\nAnd I'm working on a product at a distant proximity to this: a tool for UI designers that makes their designs live by providing clean &amp; precise HTML and CSS as they design. It is called Protoship Codegen and is at <https:\/\/protoship.io>.\n\nI tweet at <http:\/\/twitter.com\/jasim_ab|twitter.com\/jasim_ab>, where I mostly advocate for the mainstreaming of Typed Functional Programming, am a regular listener of the podcast, and am excited to meet you all!",

Thanks!\n\nWe do ML (ReasonML), but not Machine Learning :slightly_smiling_face: Two reasons:\n1) we learned the hard way that heuristics makes the product unusable. If the results are not predictable, users have a hard time building habits around it. We want a 1:1 cause\/effect relationship between the design and the output.\n\n2) many attempts in this space treat ML as a blackbox - take an entire design and feed it into an algorithm and hope for good results. We're generating code that can be put in use for building complex web applications, not just websites. This means the generated code should aspire to be as perfect as possible, and programmers should be able to grok it immediately. There are areas were ML will be useful in a fine-grained manner; a scalpel than a hammer, but at the moment we're able to produce great results with a good old fashioned expert system.",

At the moment it's pretty standard, but it's evolving and I'm adding what's useful to me. I have a public notebook made with it and a couple of private local ones.\n\nI have my own minimal todo-queue app too (<https:\/\/github.com\/interstar\/MTC-CLJ> ) which I like a lot. It's a stupidly simple program but does what I want and I think it's very powerful.\n\nI confess I just keep pdfs in folders in the file-system. My own coding projects are in git with public facing github \/ gitlab and simple web interface to git hosted on my own site.\n\nThe file system is organized in my own idiosyncratic taxonomy that I keep fiddling with.",

I want control over my software.\n\nThe one thing I really hate about my software is that I don't currently have a good synchronization story between my desktop and mobile. I used BTSync and SyncThing previously, but they've broken as Android has got more fussy about different apps sharing files.\n\nI want something P2P that isn't dependent on a cloud.

It forces me to switch back and forth rapidly between vastly separated areas, either with my eyes or with my eyes and mouse\/keyboard. It’s tricky or impossible to get a view of all the elements I am working with at the same time.\n\nWhen in “designer-mode” I often resort to diagramming (either paper or virtual). A diagram lets me position the elements the way I’m actually thinking about them, with closely related elements close to eachother and less-related elements farther apart. If an element has several closely related elements, it’s easy to draw them adjactent to eachother, whereas this wouldn’t be possible if they had to be in a flat list.\n\nIn an era of 3D virtual spaces and 3D printing, I find it ironic and aggravating that the typical programmer doesn’t even get a 2D, let alone 3D, view of their environment, but is still held down to 1D list-ual views! lol",

Something like that.\n\nIn this metaphor you could use the Z axis or tab for the history of a function, with keyboard shortcuts to say \"show me the entire layout at the current version of this card\" and \"undo that\". Might address the occlusion issue with 3D UIs.\n\nHaving lots of cards on screen may also help with the issue of hyperlinks you point out: clicking on one maybe only moves or pushes out one card, keeping the rest fairly stable visually.

Based on what you said Nelson's ideas of 'visible connection' for hypermedia comes to mind.\n\nI suppose it is ironic that large, linear blobs of text are the primary interface of programming a dynamic, interactive machine.\n\nThere is a fluidity aspect - e.g. navigating a list seems easier than clicking around in a graph - but this is a UX issue. A deeper issue might be that we need to draw a distinction between the presentation vs the deeper model of structure. Much information we deal with are cross connected clusters of entities (nothing short of a graph really works), but currently we limit ourselves to one or two projections, while mentally simulating other relationships.",

Since we don't really have a good way to build hardware that can execute recursively nested expressions, the lowest level will always execute statements that are connected by named locations. So by saying you don't want people to have to think about statements, you're asking for the lowest levels to just be \"handled\" for you. That's basically just the same priesthood arrangement we're trying to get away from, and we end up with the same questions about who watches the watchers, and so on.\n\nDemocratization is primarily a political activity, even if it happens to have some technical prerequisites that preoccupy us at the moment. Any major chasms between the front end and back end of programming lose us most of the benefit.\n\nSo you have to want people to be able to handle both statements and expressions. And compilers and OS and web frameworks and mobile apps. Luckily we can pick things up on an on-demand basis, and record the 'curriculum' in the software itself. So it's a bigger problem than you think, but not insurmountable. Except for backdoors in our processors. I have no idea how to attack _that_ problem :smile:",

                "text": "<@U5TCAFTD3> I think it's worth thinking through the implications of only wanting to democratize high-level programs. Since we don't really have a good way to build hardware that can execute recursively nested expressions, the lowest level will always execute statements that are connected by named locations. So by saying you don't want people to have to think about statements, you're asking for the lowest levels to just be \"handled\" for you. That's basically just the same priesthood arrangement we're trying to get away from, and we end up with the same questions about who watches the watchers, and so on.\n\nDemocratization is primarily a political activity, even if it happens to have some technical prerequisites that preoccupy us at the moment. Any major chasms between the front end and back end of programming lose us most of the benefit.\n\nSo you have to want people to be able to handle both statements and expressions. And compilers and OS and web frameworks and mobile apps. Luckily we can pick things up on an on-demand basis, and record the 'curriculum' in the software itself. So it's a bigger problem than you think, but not insurmountable. Except for backdoors in our processors. I have no idea how to attack _that_ problem :smile:",

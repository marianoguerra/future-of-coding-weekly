        "text": "<@U6KQ2S410> - I have a competing hypothesis, where the intention specifications have the same form they would in specifying a partial ordering (PO), but have a stricter interpretation, which one could call \"positional directives\" (PD). In a PO, \"A before B\" indicates that any ordering where A precedes B is acceptable, whereas with PD, \"A before B\" indicates that the intention is that, absent any further directives by a further author with a more refined intention, A should be placed in the order immediately before B. There are many fewer orderings compliant with a PD specification than the equivalent PO, but the PD consumes a few more bits in that one needs to track the \"relative distance\" between the site where the intention is expressed and its site of action, but this extra bookkeeping is necessary IMO in any effective authorial system. Unfortunately resolving between these hypotheses could only be done via experiments \"in the wild\" - that is, by studying the trajectories of groups of authors who were parts of genuinely separated communities collaborating on shared artefacts. This is why developing and validating genuinely new materials will take timescales comparable to the last time, i.e. ~1500 years : P",

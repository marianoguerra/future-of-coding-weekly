It's tricky because both of them are generally used in combination with regular programming IDEs (Visual Studio, XCode, Rider, etc.) and other tools that make programming in that environment easier (Resharper, Visual Assist), so I think comparing them to coding IDEs isn't quite right and the browser, or Flash comparison is more accurate, but still not quite right",

        "text": "3D gaming is such a difficult environment, that it is basically untenable without an engine underneath your work to make it feasible. There are many 3D engines. The company that made all the flight simulator series for EA had an engine specific to flight. And i am sure the driving games have engines as well. Unreal Engine is very sophisticated in its workflow; getting the same code and assets to work on such a huge range of hardware, where the number of polygons has to be adjusted to match the platform requirements is a huge part of it. But there is nothing easy to learn about the Unreal engine, it is a career decision to invest into learning such a complex tool.",

It isn't clear to me that any of this will stay put, and in another 30 years an entirely different workflow may arise for 3D graphics.",

I am hoping however that for more moderate 2D gaming we can drastically simplify the toolchain, and make it much easier to make graphical interactive software. I don't find either of those tools to be easy to learn, and 100 hours in those tools is like a drop in the bucket. I believe that a system with less than 100 hour training time can be made.",

        "text": "I'm a Javascript React frontend dev. Right now I'm trying out ideas on the side in a few areas:\n• Coloring interfaces. I'm actively working on an experiment for this. This work might be helpful for future app UI design tools. I'll post links on this soon.\n• Responsive components. I want to set breakpoints at the component level, not at the page level.\n• Random experiments in hierarchical and composable systems.\n\nThe hypothesis is that better primitives can unlock a lot of new possibilities, specifically for programming UIs.\n\nThanks <@U5TCAFTD3> for tweeting a link to this. It's very exciting that there's a community of people who are interested in the future of coding.",

        "text": "Hi all! I’m a Computational Media PhD student at the Expressive Intelligence Studio at UC Santa Cruz, working on approachable and playful mixed-initiative (AI+human creative collaboration) tools to augment human creativity. Like a lot of you, Bret Victor’s work was probably the main thing that got me into future-of-programming stuff, but I’m also inspired by games like Spore that place the process of creating stuff at the center of the play experience. More recently I’ve been thinking a lot about the problem of how to empower people to shape their digital social environments to suit their personal and community-specific needs.\n\nI’m nominally an “AI researcher”, but I think the approaches to AI that are currently in vogue make a critical mistake: they focus way too much on _guessing_ what people want rather than _asking_ them what they want (and giving them the languages they need to answer properly). As a result, all of the AI problems I’m interested in end up also being HCI and\/or PL problems to some extent, and my work keeps overlapping with future-of-programming stuff in interesting ways.\n\nSome of you probably recognize me from Twitter; I’m <https:\/\/twitter.com\/maxkreminski>. My personal website and blog is at <https:\/\/mkremins.github.io>.",

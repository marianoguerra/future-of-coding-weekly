        "text": "Hi! I'm Spencer. I live in NYC.\n\nI have had crazy ideas about programming languages bouncing around in my head for at least a year now. It seems to me that inadequacies in our programming languages and surrounding tooling are the root cause of most technological troubles.\n\nI've previously worked with computer vision, where I implemented a number of image processing algorithms. The tools we used were grossly insufficient for the task. CUDA was painfully low level, all algorithms became mucked up with performance concerns, code was not portable, build systems were tangled nightmares of dependencies on antiquated software from the 70's... I've been trying to find a better way.\n\nMy ideas are still vague and poorly defined but a month ago I started taking these thoughts seriously. I've been learning type theory in an attempt to gain the necessary background to either implement my ideas or determine if they are even feasible. I have a very long way to go to acquire enough background to even understand what I'm getting into... but you have to start somewhere!",

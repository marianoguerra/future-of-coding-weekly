        "text": "Hello everyone! Many thanks to <@U5STGTB3J> for inviting me to this place. My name is Joel and I live in Cambridge, UK, where I completed my CS undergraduate degree last summer. For the past year I've been a software engineer in a local startup. But it is my working on my blog (<https:\/\/programmingmadecomplicated.wordpress.com>) and on the general vision that we share here, that gives me true fulfillment - especially since nobody I've met in real life expresses any sort of interest or enthusiasm about this sort of thing. Fortunately I've found many who do online, and I'll eagerly attend any meetups in the UK.\n\nOrigin story is, in a nutshell: I wanted to make games as a kid so I learned GameMaker. I then traded the ability to make games for learning to Code Properly and now I want my creativity-outlet back :angry:\n\nI would try different programming languages and libraries, different paradigms, design patterns, and all sorts of elaborate schemes to manage the complexity of code in my various barely-started game projects. I enlisted as a main developer for an online fan game project, and couldn't deliver the goods. I eventually developed some sort of philosophical paralysis about programming in general, questioning my life choices and wondering if I could ever tolerate the career path I was headed towards, until I was snapped out of it from finding Alan Kay, Bret Victor and VPRI on the 'net roughly two years ago. Finally I realised that one of my basic foundations, that of \"language being primary \/ fundamental\", was in reality a limiting box of artificial creation :slightly_smiling_face:\nAnd now I really, really want to explore bootstrapping and try to bootstrap a graphical system somehow using shapes instead of source code.\n\n(meanwhile, at work I just do normal frustrating software-engineer stuff :neutral_face: but I will not stay there forever.)",

        "text": "Oh yeah I didn't link to my project. It's <http:\/\/zells.org|zells.org>\nIt's not really \"research\" (yet), more a \"let's build something and see how it goes\". I guess people are naturally suspicious about any project that aims to \"make programming easier\", because it's tricky to prove it and I haven't seen any project that really supported such claims with evidence. And it's especially difficult to extrapolate from early demos, don't you think?\n\nI must confess that after watching your demo I myself was wondering where you're going with this, but looking at it from a \"this is to teach problem solving skills to young students in place of MATLAB\" perspective, it absolutely makes sense to me. Did you consider putting that goal into the intro on <http:\/\/mechlang.net|mechlang.net> (which works now for me, btw)? Writing this I realized I should probably try out to describe my own project from a value-oriented perspective myself. But first I would have to find a value.\n\nHey would you have time for a call? I'm very interested in your plans for running the nonprofit. To me it seems that funding it still a very tricky thing for this kind of projects. And it that regard I'd also be very interested to hear about your experience with Eve if you're not tired of talking about it :smiley:",

I think you’ve put some good ideas in Zells!\nI started implementing Mech only a few months ago, and the idea for the nonprofit is still nascent as well. The paragraph I typed above is literally the first time I’ve put the concept into words, so that gives  you an idea how far along these ideas are :stuck_out_tongue: But I’m trying to get them out there early and see if anything resonates, so I’m glad you like the sound of a nonprofit, and I would definitely talk more with you about those topic.

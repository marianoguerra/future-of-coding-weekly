        "text": "Hey all, I'm having serious doubts about continuing in my job and because this community is essentially what I want to do for a living, please allow me to seek your advice. Sorry if the following suffers from flaws of tone or content, but better out than in.\n\nThe other day I was writing some JSON validation boilerplate and I became quite stressed wondering if I picked the wrong career. And I've only been doing it for one year! I feel like I am wasting my time and not making use of the skills I have. Working as a software engineer doesn’t seem to be about “solving interesting problems”, despite what the recruitment ads say, nor is it about having the creative power to make your own work easier via automation.\n\nInitially I got the impression they wanted “clever people” for the knowledge and design\/engineering skill they can bring to the table, but actually the reality is that I don’t get to make use of 90% of what I’ve learned elsewhere, instead I just do the digital equivalent of manual labour.\n\nI deliberately under-perform so that the code I write and the ideas I contribute are compatible with the mindsets of my coworkers. I've been surprised at the overwhelming lack of interest among them in the aspect of programming that you do yourself, i.e. architectural principles \/ design patterns.\n\nBefore I entered the industry I had the impression that this sort of thing was useful knowledge to have, and that people would just have ... discussions. But there barely is any discussion about our own craft except for specific named projects *other* people have come up with, like recommendations for Python webservers, testing frameworks, etc.\n\nI'm also discouraged by the fear that if I display too much interest in that sort of thing then somebody will call me an Architecture Astronaut, and link to some article Joel Spolsky once wrote, and I won't know what to say.\n\nBecause so much of what I want to talk about is new stuff that hasn't been long established or even fully thought through yet, I take an 'improv' attitude towards ideas -- meaning, if something is absurd and half-baked then that is an *opportunity* for conversation and development. But people around me seem to take that as the *end* of a conversation -- interpreting it as a worked-through, actionable proposal, which has problem X and Y that are up to me, the proposer, to fix (instead of collaboratively fix due to the idea sounding promising.) After this happened enough times I just learned not to bother trying to contribute or communicate in that way. And it's not necessarily their fault; to me it boils down to two different reactions to absurd or half-baked ideas -- exploration or dismissal, each with valid contexts of use. I'm not that confident in my verbal communication skills, but I do manage fine with other topics, so I'm not sure that's the issue here.\n\nSo, if anybody else with basic programming and google skills could do what I do, then why should I take their job while constantly fantasising about actually making use of what I learned at uni and elsewhere?\n\nMaybe I belong in research, but I don’t know how that works. I don’t know if you get to pick what you research, or if you have to sell it as something that will deliver concrete results after X years. (Thinking about the STEPS project here)\n\nI already try to spend my free time doing my sort of informal research, but I'm surprised at how unenthusiastic I feel about it after I come home from work, having spent much of the day suppressing daydreams about the exact same stuff. If this was not the case, then I could tolerate my job, but the fact that it's stealing my energy from something I feel is far more important, is too much.",

I'm still in university but will have to think about this in about a year too.\nOne thing I can add from personal experience is that working on the \"future of programming\" full time didn't work out for me. I took 6 months off and focused on my ideas. Afterwards, I was disappointed because I didn't make much progress that I could show others to prove to them that I hadn't wasted my time. You could say that it doesn't matter what others say, but I found that it does matter to me. Also, working on something for weeks and then realizing that it won't work out was really depressing for me.\nMy current plan is to get a job that's interesting but doesn't consume all my energy (maybe part time) and do researchy things as a hobby. \nI hope doing FoP stuff as a hobby will prevent me from feeling pressure to produce results as fast as possible. If it's just an additional thing apart from your regular contribution to society, you can do anything crazy, take as long as you like and stop whenever you like. This might be a good way to stay open-minded to all kinds of ideas and great visions.\nWhether or not I'll actually do this and whether it will work for me - I don't know.

Sounds like your deeper concerns are connecting with colleagues and being engaged in the work.  Connection is important, else why bother?  Likewise, being digital manual labour isn't so bad if it's labour in service of a worthy end?  Fantasizing is a favorable sign, may just be that you aren't in an encouraging environment.  So outside of work, how have you tried to make fantasy into reality?  How did that feel?",

My thoughts are closely aligned with <@UA14TGLTC>'s comment above - connection with people is important and also 'labour in service of a worthy end'. I don't have experience in academia, but I do think in the industry there's a wide range of technologies, cultures and environments. It's possible that even with the current state of programming, a software based job can be a positive experience. It might help to start by identifying your strong preferences, e.g. the technologies\/languages, scope of problem, level of autonomy, etc. you'd want to keep you engaged. I feel the actual field (e.g. programming tools vs making apps) is less important. E.g. if you don't agree with the basic design choices and you don't have autonomy over them, a 'programming tool' may not be that much fun.",

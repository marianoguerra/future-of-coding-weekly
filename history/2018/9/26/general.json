I think it’s targeting the right platform (Web and soon WASM), is developed with the right mindset (extreme learnability) and using the right paradigms (purely functional programming and something close to the actor model).

After having contemplated “future programming” for around 3 years now, I don’t think that developing visual languages or augmenting text with visual widgets (i.e. working on how to _present_ code) will get us very far. This has been tried for decades in many different forms and the ideas rarely hold up, so my hunch is that addressing challenges through visual representations is a dead end. The right kind of question to ask is perhaps: what does an effective development _workflow_ look like? This hints that a focus on tools may be needed: for example instant feedback tools (how do I see what the thing I’m building actually does), code organisation tools (where do I put code and documentation, how do I keep track of history, and how do I find the right thing when I need it), sharing tools (how do I share _libraries_ and how do I share _applications_), and collaboration tools (how do I work as part of a team). Importantly, the building blocks of a language are themselves tools for constructing programs. They’re the “obvious” thing that has been a central focus for decades but they remain an important consideration.\n\nSo far I’ve been referring to things that many “Future of Programming” people have identified as desirable, but my own understanding of the Future of Programming involves technologies outside what we consider “programming tech” today: stuff like glasses-based AR for the interface (we’re headed beyond WIMP and the desktop metaphor; give it 5 years) and autonomous distributed systems as a computational material (“blockchains” but not as useless as existing ones: something close to the potential of <https:\/\/dfinity.org\/>). All this stuff is out of our hands, but we should factor it all into our understanding of what tech is on the horizon and how it will affect how we might build programming editors and programs.

I've been thinking along these lines: if 'code', 'schema' and 'data' are held in the *same* versioned (immutable, append only) model, maybe we can have some sanity? New schema is introduced as new version of older schema, but older data and code artifacts continue to point to the older schema. So something like the Git\/MVCC model where the versioned artifacts are not byte blobs but higher level entities such as functions, types, values etc. that can all refer to each other.\n\nThe main idea is that all of these are in a *single* versioning system. So a version number in such a system identifies a very precise snapshot of the 'system state' which includes not just the data but also the code and schema entities that exist 'at that time'.\n\nDoes anything like this exist?",

I agree that looking at the 'whole workflow' and use cases is a great way to start. Perhaps also reconsider the prevalent 'languages are distinct from tooling' mindset?\n\nI was just writing something called 'Systems, not Programs' - arguing for a system-first perspective: we are 'crafting systems with behavior', not 'writing programs' -  the latter is only way to do the former but takes up most of the mindshare, etc. In the end any 'future programming' model needs to solve not just programming in the 'small' - i.e. what happens *inside* a single program - but more importantly it needs to solve 'in the large' - i.e. how programs compose with each other within a system. In fact, are these even two separate problems? (Only if you presume the 'program' concept).\n\nThis is where today's static typing approach breaks down - you can only build 'small' things because all the verification and binding happens in one shot. Composing programs is 'out of scope'. You cant build\/deploy whole systems this way ('the internet is dynamically typed'). OTOH verification is nice so we need some way to reconcile with the fact that the system is continuously evolving with parts being upgraded and replaced. We may need some kind of incremental binding and verification model (~'bind time verification' instead of compile time or run time).\n\nRe the text vs visual debate, I agree 'augmenting text with widgets' is a poor solution, but what about replacing text itself with a richer substrate? See <http:\/\/subtext-lang.org|subtext-lang.org> for instance.",

That includes my own ideas. In particular, Elm draws a lot of attention from Haskell developers. These developers come to Elm with lots of ideas about how to \"improve\" Elm: often they want it to be more like Haskell. Haskell has never been considered a \"learnable\" or \"simple\" programming language, so Haskell features often conflict with Elm's goals.\n\nThat's not to say you can't discuss ideas for how Elm can grow. The community is very receptive to discussion (blog posts, forum posts...). The only challenge you'll face is that the core contributors won't integrate ideas (or accept your help to develop them) unless they fit Elm's goals.",

This is already done in C\/C++ with header files and object files. Of course this doesn't support interface evolution, but that's a problem which is again independent of static and dynamic typing: if an interface breaks, it's going to cause errors whenever the types happen to be checked.\n(I'll again mention row types as a kind of data type that can adapt to non-breaking changes without causing static type checking to fail).",

What I'm really interested in, my work scenario, is where I keep making the \"same\" software with superficially \"slight\" modifications at not trivial scale (~50,000 LOC in the project).  If we're running this year's version vs last year's what is the diff not in the code (that ends up also being about ~50,000 LOC as it turns out) but in the experience: of the 30 odd screens in the application how much does each one differ?  It ends up being pervasive (most screens) but smallish (one or two things).",

        "text": "A friend just asked me The Question™: \"Hey, a friend of mine wants to learn programming. He hasn't done any programming before. Where should he start?\"\n\nI get that question a lot and still feel uncomfortable answering it. My usual strategy is to ask a few questions back to learn more about the person, which background they have, why they want to learn programming or what they find interesting about it, and what their preferred style of learning is (reading books and tutorials, watching videos, etc.).  Then I try to present them with a few pointers to online resources that I consider a good path depending on the answers I get. Most often I end up pointing them to either Processing(js), Unity, Swift Playgrounds, Python, or JavaScript\/Web.\n\nDo you have any good heuristics on how to help people with that question? What are the questions you ask to find out about the person to make sure your advice is sound? And what are the absolute beginner resources per language that you recommend to people who start from basically zero?",

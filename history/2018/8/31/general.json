        "text": "Hey <@UCGR73CAY>. Read your posts and watched the demo. Very nice and quite impressive.\nI'm a big fan of Eve as well and got a lot of inspiration from it.\nFunny story: just an hour before you joined this channel on Wednesday, I gave a presentation of my project to the research group here in Potsdam and somebody said that my demo reminded him of one he saw recently but couldn't remember the name. Turns out he was talking about Mech!\nThe reason he was reminded of it was that he didn't understand what problem I'm trying to solve and he had the same feeling when he watched your demo. I thought that's a very interesting sentiment. You said you're targeting \"for very small values of 'use'\". What could these values be? Do you have a specific use case \/ target group in mind that you're aiming for? How would you answer the question \"What problem are you trying to solve?\"",

Some hack that involves RSS and a bot or Slack integration? I don’t know much about Slack, but maybe someone here does. I’d love to have a single place where I can hear about all you great people writing interesting stuff into the internet.",

        "text": "Thanks for the feedback <@U7C7B75R6>. I agree nesting is a missing piece - as the post suggests. If we had that, would there be other pieces that seem important but missing? E.g. most text languages contain tokens, should 'token types' be a built-in feature? Or perhaps 'identity of names', e.g. a repeated variable name refers to the same variable - could this idea be encoded in the core syntax of text? Or even 'reference to another file' which is another feature re-implemented in many languages ('import x', 'include &lt;y&gt;;', etc.)\nWhat I'm looking to explore is that while we can always have incremental improvements, there may be something fundamental in our premise that needs to change for a big leap. One pov is that when we come up with the idea of a 'file' we have this clear, fixed boundary around a construct, but in reality all concepts are deeply connected with others in the system. I discuss this in some of the other posts.",

        "text": "Hey Nikolas, I would love to see any links you have on the research you presented.\n\nI don't know if I should feel good that someone across the world heard on my project, or horrified that they found it memorable only because they couldn’t see the point :stuck_out_tongue:\n\nI’m designing Mech to be at the center of a nonprofit I’m in the process of forming that will teach 21st century problem solving skills to middle and high school students. There are many programs today focused on teaching kids how to code, but I find that a great deal of these programs place a heavy focus on teaching specific language mechanics, while some students are not able to even formulate their problem in a way they could express in the language. I think that problem solving and critical thinking are not taught in schools today, so before we rush to teach kids how to write software and apps and websites, we first need to teach them what abstraction is and how it’s useful, how to do things like decompose a large problem into smaller parts, and how to marshal a wide variety of tools (including programming languages) to solve each part.\n\nI've found some success myself running a curriculum with MATLAB and iRobot creates. I had 11-12 year olds who never really used computers before (came from underserved communities) writing pretty impressive programs for the creates, and I attribute that to MATLAB's REPL and the uniform array representation. They had a very tight development loop and could experiment freely, as well as not worry about types and data structures and other things. By the end of the few days they basically knew all of MATLAB (arrays, function, loops, conditionals... that's about it.), and could write simple maze following controllers for robots among other things.\n\nThat’s where Mech comes in. I’d like to use Mech as the platform in place of MATLAB because I think the collection of features I can cook up will better serve the interests of the students. They will also be able to use it from home for free, and even if they don’t go on to do any programming at all in the future, it is my goal they would at least understand to use Mech or even similar tools like Excel or SQL to leverage the vast array of information processing capabilities available to us.\n\n&gt; You said you're targeting \"for very small values of 'use'\". What could these values be?\n\nYeah, what I meant specifically by that was my first milestone is to have Mech act as a remote procedure call destination. Basically, it will sit on a WebSocket and accept queries and send back a response based on that. I think that’s about the minimally useful thing it could be. I’ll figure out where to go from there, because I’m almost at that point I think.",

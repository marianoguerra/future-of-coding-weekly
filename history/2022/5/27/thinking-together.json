But, lets say user B does this before that:\n\n*User B:*\nInserts an expression that references and displays the open state:\n\n```const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);\nreturn (\n  &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;Dialog open={open} /&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Open: {open}&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n);```\nIf User A now wants to undo, removing the `open` state would break User B's use of said state.\n\nAre there any examples in research or open source of how to gracefully resolve this? I assume that node based programming could run into this dependency challenge, but I'm unaware of any node based tools that support multiplayer with undo/redo.\n\nOne approach I can think of is to check whether there are dependencies on nodes that would be removed by undo, and simply aborting the undo with an error, but I'm curious if there is a more elegant approach.\n\nOn a related note, the UI would also have to prevent a traditional delete operation on the `open` state, since this would leave the program in an invalid state.",

HTML is a description of a document without much regard for how a particular client will render it. CSS is a bunch of optional hints to the client about how to render it. Browser clients are designed for all sorts of different device types, and when a new device type comes along there's often a web browser for it that adapts existing HTML to work passably well with the new type of device. (I'm always shocked when I load my wildly complex website, loaded with SVG animations, on, say, a PlayStation, and it works 99% perfectly.)"

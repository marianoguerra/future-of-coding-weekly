Production traffic is routed through the developers notebook if you have it open, so you can observe the system live. I exploit observables dataflow so each step of the processing pipeline is cached, so you can see exactly where a problem occurred, and thanks to hot code reload, you can fix a bug and have the pipeline continue without rerunning prior steps allowing easy iterative programming workflows. Of course, because Observable notebooks are executing Javascript, you can attach a debugger too (even programmatically)\nOne click forkable, MIT licensed.\n\nThis is what I think the future of software development should look like. But I am struggling to communicate this well. The idea is to make cloud programming feel local, to exclusively test in prod, because when you are hitting third party APIs its a waste of effort mocking a staging environment, or a local environment. I want to remove the thick layers of indirection in the development process that no longer make sense. Forget git, forget toolchains, just straight to prod using modern Javascript, debugged with the authoritative debuggers built into browsers.",

Production traffic is routed through the developers notebook if you have it open, so you can observe the system live. I exploit observables dataflow so each step of the processing pipeline is cached, so you can see exactly where a problem occurred, and thanks to hot code reload, you can fix a bug and have the pipeline continue without rerunning prior steps allowing easy iterative programming workflows. Of course, because Observable notebooks are executing Javascript, you can attach a debugger too (even programmatically)\nOne click forkable, MIT licensed.\n\nThis is what I think the future of software development should look like. But I am struggling to communicate this well. The idea is to make cloud programming feel local, to exclusively test in prod, because when you are hitting third party APIs its a waste of effort mocking a staging environment, or a local environment. I want to remove the thick layers of indirection in the development process that no longer make sense. Forget git, forget toolchains, just straight to prod using modern Javascript, debugged with the authoritative debuggers built into browsers."

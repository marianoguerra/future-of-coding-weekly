        "text": "A few shower thoughts on AI and end user programming.\n• I imagine this group is more averse to AI research compared to baseline in tech\/CS. The following comes to mind:\n    ◦ Most algorithms today tend to be pretty opaque, whereas we value understandable systems.\n    ◦ Current end user systems (e.g. Alexa) are super frustrating when they don’t give you what you want, since their behavior is hard to manipulate.\n    ◦ There’s an uneasiness about AI systems replacing the things we DO want to control; we value systems that put people in control.\n    ◦ There’s little value for human intuition in most current AI research, with some notable exceptions below.\n• The deep learning gold rush has created a situation with interesting analogies to the “programmer\/end user” dichotomy. Researchers who develop the expertise to *design* deep learning systems tend to “think in deep learning” to the exclusion of better suited approaches in some contexts, while those without a deep understanding have little ability to modify their systems.\n• Going further with this, two of the most interesting researchers right now IMO are <https:\/\/fchollet.com\/|François Chollet> and <https:\/\/web.mit.edu\/cocosci\/josh.html|Josh Tenenbaum>, both of whom see _program synthesis_ as the key to advancing AI in a more interesting and useful direction. There’s a parallel with the popular “Type I\/Type II” thinking analogy: deep learning is great for Type I thinking (pattern matching, interpolation, “geometry”), while there hasn’t been much progress yet with Type II thinking (generalization, planning, “topology”). The idea is that you need both: a perception layer that goes from continuous to discrete, and a “programming” layer to work with the results. A recent example of program synthesis is <https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2006.08381|DreamCoder>. \n• IMO we’re about to see all the wrong assumptions that are encoded in current software systems recapitulated in this new trend in AI research, since these efforts will use existing programming languages for the program synthesis component (DreamCoder uses a lisp). I think there’s an opportunity for our group’s way of thinking to improve on the “program synthesis” part of the pipeline.\n• Chollet’s “<https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1911.01547|Abstraction and Reasoning (ARC)>” paper and challenge is to me a very clever and appealing illustration of the limitations of deep learning and the potential of program synthesis.\n    ◦ One “big idea” is to optimize for generalization by limiting the number of training examples available to an algorithm.\n• “Building Machines that Learn and Think Like People” is another nice intro to this direction in AI research, linked in this rather <https:\/\/gradadmissions.mit.edu\/blog\/carving-nature-its-joints|delightful essay>.\n• Lick’s <http:\/\/worrydream.com\/refs\/Licklider%20-%20Man-Computer%20Symbiosis.pdf|Man-Computer Symbiosis> paper from 1960 is as fresh as ever (not to mention <http:\/\/worrydream.com\/refs\/Licklider%20-%20The%20Computer%20as%20Communication%20Device.pdf|The Computer as Communication Device>).\n• If this is all too nebulous, Chollet’s <https:\/\/slideslive.com\/38935790\/abstraction-reasoning-in-ai-systems-modern-perspectives|NeuroIPS talk> (the first 40 min) is a nice crisp intro.\nInterested if anyone else is thinking about these topics.",

This term can then be typed as a free type variable. However, the number is inserted in the function position of the application term, which still results in a type error.\nThe last sentence is incorrect. The number is actually inserted in the argument of the application term in the underlying language, and there is no type error.\nPerhaps the confusion stems from the sugared surface language showing it as a number with a question mark next to it (which we call a “fragment” with a number in it).",

It compiles to JavaScript (npm packages), and is fully extensible from within. This release is still far from our original vision - lacking in instrumentation, types, search, and general UX - but is usable enough to prototype APIs and integrations.\n\nQuick download links:\n• Linux (deb): <https:\/\/release.cranq.io\/cranq_1.8.0_amd64.deb>\n• Linux (rpm): <https:\/\/release.cranq.io\/Cranq-1.8.0-1.x86_64.rpm>\n• MacOs: <https:\/\/release.cranq.io\/Cranq-1.8.0-x64.dmg>\n• Windows: <https:\/\/release.cranq.io\/Cranq-1.8.0_Setup.exe>\nThoughts, feedback welcome.\nWe're also looking for case studies - projects that we help you build in CRANQ.

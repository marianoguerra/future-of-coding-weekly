There's no motivation to do those things faster. Usually, competition would create the incentive, but in the legal realm competition doesn't work, because it's an oligopoly.

Because they are paid hourly, and rewarded professionally for the quantity of hours billed, not the quality of the results, they are perfectly happy to do inefficient things that they enjoy, and are paid for. There's no motivation to do those things faster. Usually, competition would create the incentive, but in the legal realm competition doesn't work, because it's an oligopoly. So there are differences between convincing lawyers and everyone else to use technology."

Re: cloning existing data vs starting anew, we decided to build from scratch so a user will have a clean, single source of truth while still having the ability to write some code (and potentially publish it for others to install with a click!) that can import data from other sources with an API.  We would happily assist someone in making an agent that pulled, for example, Google calendar data into your Aspen calendar.  \n2.  It’s a great question. I think previous attempts at creating personal servers with one-click installable apps have started with existing open-source projects and used ordinary linux VM’s; this however, is fairly costly to the user (paying when not using), still fairly technical to manage, and the existing apps tend to be either low quality or aimed towards developers. Our platform is effectively “serverless” so it is much less expensive to run, has a uniform application model so you can much more easily work with the underlying data and API’s, and should be much easier for non-technical users to use.

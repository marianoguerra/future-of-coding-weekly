I need to look through them.\n\nWhat <@UJBAJNFLK> mentioned resonates with me and reminded me of my personal stance that a lot of modern tech developments have seemed to forget about computers and tech _augmenting_ human abilities. We see this in “self-driving” cars: let’s just slap machine learning on this system designed for human use and replace the human. It doesn’t work and completely skips the step where we augment human abilities.\n\nI see that in automated theorem proving. The headlines are always about replacing humans rather than framing those systems as they really are: automated proofs are developed by humans in human developed languages and cross-referenced against existing proofs by humans or references. Those systems are augmenting human work but the framing is always “replacing”.\n\nI’d personally like to see more concentration on augmenting human abilities, and I think that’s where machine learning can help out.\n\n(Apologies for rambling and the stream of consciousness.

It doesn’t work and completely skips the step where we augment human abilities.\n\nI see that in automated theorem proving. The headlines are always about replacing humans rather than framing those systems as they really are: automated proofs are developed by humans in human developed languages and cross-referenced against existing proofs by humans or references. Those systems are augmenting human work but the framing is always “replacing”.\n\nI’d personally like to see more concentration on augmenting human abilities, and I think that’s where machine learning can help out.\n\n(Apologies for rambling and the stream of consciousness.

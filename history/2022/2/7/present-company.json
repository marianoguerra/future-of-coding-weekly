It is a bit slower than the realtime database (like 200ms per commit vs 10ms). It is clientside first, which is Firebase's unique features. It supports offline persisted cache, and latency compensation, which greatly simplifies apps as you don't need to manage when data gets flushed (same with realtime RT DB). The model is live automatically updating queries, you should try to avoid polling the DB for instance.\n\nIt replaces the firebase realtime database, though that DB has a lot of good features that are still nice.

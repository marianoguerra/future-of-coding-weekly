A little more detail on my belief system:\n\n&gt; Understanding a strange codebase is hard. I can't change that, but I think I can make it easier for people to persevere. I want to carve steps into the wall of the learning process. Most programs today yield insight only after days or weeks of unrewarded effort. I want an hour of reward for an hour (or three) of effort.\n(<http:\/\/akkartik.name\/about>)\n\nMy previous project actually involved helping people understand how their code was translated all the way down to machine code: <https:\/\/github.com\/akkartik\/mu>. It wasn't visual, however. The goal is to introduce increasing subsets on demand -- and minimize the amount of backtracking. Later stages shouldn't require unlearning previous stages.\n\nThe point of my orbital mechanics example was that we teach Physics to everyone today (aspirationally) but we still don't require everyone to know _all of Physics_. I've long advocated that everyone needs to learn to code (most recently <https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/akkartik-2022-01-16-fosdem>), but I haven't quite been so bold as to say everyone should know, say, how to write an OS. Instead, my definition of literacy is, \"everyone can read novels even if only a few people write novels.\"\n\nSo I think you can have everything you want while having diverse programming activities. As long as the process of learning to go from one kind to the other doesn't have abrupt transitions.\n\nAnother possibility. In a world where everyone knows to program, I think we'll also see a change in the distributions of different kinds of programs being created. If everyone's hacking on federated versions of services we don't need all the queries-per-second, uptime guarantees, fault tolerance of centralized services today. CRDTs give us ways to minimize what people have to learn about race conditions. So the spectrum of programming may shrink, making it easier for people to span it from end to end.",

Instead, my definition of literacy is, \"everyone can read novels even if only a few people write novels.\"\n\nSo I think you can have everything you want while having diverse programming activities. As long as the process of learning to go from one kind to the other doesn't have abrupt transitions.\n\nAnother possibility. In a world where everyone knows to program, I think we'll also see a change in the distributions of different kinds of programs being created. If everyone's hacking on federated versions of services we don't need all the queries-per-second, uptime guarantees, fault tolerance of centralized services today. CRDTs give us ways to minimize what people have to learn about race conditions. So the spectrum of programming may shrink, making it easier for people to span it from end to end."

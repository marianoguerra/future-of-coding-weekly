(That seems like a good future of coding topic, or does anyone know a specific \"end user programming\" community)\n\nOver the last year I have built my own language and structured editor. Pushing the idea of how much can a compiler tell you about your program. The idea is to have a really small AST, there are about 10 different nodes. Because it so small writing new static analysis tools should be easy, it's also really easy to target new environments. i.e. it took me about an hour to write a to Javascript. To keep it small I've made some unusual choices, for one the language contains type provider but not numbers. I keep a dev log of 3-8 minute long videos on various topics. <https://petersaxton.uk/log/>\nBeyond that it's not really usable to anyone else (I haven't documented the keys for the editor so the only way to start is by referring to the source) That might change at somepoint, but I don't know when.",

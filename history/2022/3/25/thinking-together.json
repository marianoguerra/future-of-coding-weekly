        "text": "This is a compelling kernel of a thought undoubtedly. IMO there’s a bigger discussion here around how rarely design + UX is factored in when general protocols are designed &amp; agreed upon. In some ways, it’s hard (e.g. the email protocol was designed in a day and age where the GUI wasn’t really a thing \/ key factor).\n\nAs a tangent — in my day job, I work to support a popular open source project that has a large GUI footprint (that’s also open source) and unsurprisingly the discussions around what to change are driven primarily by engineers oriented towards implementation details. Designers aren’t usually empowered to participate in the open source change management process and many engineers don’t have design skills of their own (it’s a deep separate skill \/ field so no surprise there!).\n\nI know <@UFPPABQ7P> has done some thinking here for <https:\/\/blockprotocol.org\/> that _feels_ related to this discussion",

IMO there’s a bigger discussion here around how rarely design + UX is factored in when general protocols are designed & agreed upon. In some ways, it’s hard (e.g. the email protocol was designed in a day and age where the GUI wasn’t really a thing \/ key factor).\n\nAs a tangent — in my day job, I work to support a popular open source project that has a large GUI footprint (that’s also open source) and unsurprisingly the discussions around what to change are driven primarily by engineers oriented towards implementation details. Designers aren’t usually empowered to participate in the open source change management process and many engineers don’t have design skills of their own (it’s a deep separate skill \/ field so no surprise there!).\n\nI know "

There are probably other simple \/ obvious approaches, but probably not many, because the interaction here is really, really simple — it's a binary off \/ on. Looking at the real world, it's hard to find examples of a binary off \/ on control that aren't basically the same as the top 3 bullets.

I’m in a process of learning to think about this stuff and would be delighted to have feedback\/think together about the topic of designing async into a language!\n---\n\n*Colorless async seems obviously great, but what if the opposite is also true?*\nI read this blog post <https:\/\/journal.stuffwithstuff.com\/2015\/02\/01\/what-color-is-your-function\/|What Color is Your Function?>? on ways to integrate async into a language. It’s an entertaining  and convincing read by a super experienced developer. The article leads you through a chain of very obvious thoughts, that you cannot imagine even wanting to contradict; ending up with the understanding that the best solution is to enable using sync and async functions interchangeably, e.g. by supporting go-routines.\n\n*I was totally convinced*.

Thinking of them and visualizing them as distinctly different is a game-changer for the human mind: A top-down understanding can be conveyed to non-programmers and programmers alike, etc. In the typical visualization, sync stuff is not “red functions”, they are arrows. async stuff is not “blue functions”, they are rectangles. Arrows and Rectangles composes perfectly, _because of their differences_. It’s hard to see what’s gained conceptually by merging arrows and rectangles into one thing.",

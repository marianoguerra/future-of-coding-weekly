I think, the “new” way has to be an order of magnitude “better” than the old way.\n2. I think that, in the interim, one has to incorporate the “old” into the “new”.  Somehow.  To appease the “assembler programmers”. (IMO, today’s “assembler mindset” is (1) the belief that there is “one language to rule them all”, (2) “everything must be synchronous”, (3) CALL\/RETURN).\n3. Maybe we need to ignore the current crop of “programmers” and target a different kind of programming?\n\nOn the technical front, we need to overcome the fear of compiling non-text to running programs (I have example WIPs of compiling "

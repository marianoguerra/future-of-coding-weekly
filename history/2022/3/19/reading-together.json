In this essay I explore various concepts lurking behind distinct uses of this word, highlighting two traditions in which the word came into use largely independently: engineering traditions on the one hand, and those of symbolic logic on the other. These traditions are founded on differing attitudes to the nature and purpose of abstraction, but their distinct uses of “type” have never been explicitly unified. One result is that discourse _across_ these traditions often finds itself at cross purposes, such as _overapplying_ one sense of “type” where another is appropriate, and occasionally proceeding to draw wrong conclusions. I illustrate this with examples from well-known and justly well-regarded literature, and argue that ongoing developments in both the theory and practice of programming make now a good time to resolve these problems.\n\n*What I Like*\nKell is a very salient writer and thinker and this paper in particular helped disambiguate the notions of “type” in a way that’s been useful for my thinking. He first breaks out “data types” from “type disciplines” and explores the essential properties of both, I find this two-part distinction useful, but his deconstruction of “data types” in particular was insightful and I highly recommend at least skimming through that section for anyone working on programming systems.",

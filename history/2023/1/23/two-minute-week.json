I believe that to truly create a new level of abstraction I need to sacrifice such ability, as the code generated will probably  lose the benefits of the visual flow. I'm taking a more code-integrated approach, which I will share here soon! Hope that will make sense\n2. Diffs - have it in my mind for sure - side-by-side flows (or overlay), with indications for removed/added/changed. I'm not sure how to do it yet, but I'm sure it's possible\n3. Can't agree more! I'm planning on doing something similar to this <http://xai-primer.com/tool/|http://xai-primer.com/tool/> for a while. Holding me back from doing it until everything else is done, but it's definitely on my short-term plans!",

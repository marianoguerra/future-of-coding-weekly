Developer tooling is expensive to build but harder to monetise?\n\nAbout the inventing new notations, I really love that and the reference to physics. I wasn't aware that they did that... but thinking about DSLs and how we seem to invent new languages or libraries (pseudo DSLs in my book) when there is a vastly new domain in computing... it connects a lot of dots for me"

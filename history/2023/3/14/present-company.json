And for these ones I do like them to be immutable, so I create a new one each day.\n\nThis proces is loosely based on the ideas behind the methodology of the Essay app ("

That \"lock\" flag is code you have to maintain, documentation, space in your UI, space in the user's mental model. What does it let the user _do_ better than if they just... don't edit the note?\n\nDealing with a massive pile of braindumps is definitely a problem with that kind of workflow, but I think it's more one of categorization and retrieval. You don't need immutability for that. Tagging things by project, or tagging them \"#braindump\" to get them out of your face. (One can imagine a pile of write-once style notes bundled with a nicer summary, but I think that's heading back into the territory that should be usage pattern rather than code). At a stretch, high power search to get stuff out of them. Practically, I mostly use `ls -lrt` to focus and the occasional `grep` to find stuff.",

You don't need immutability for that. Tagging things by project, or tagging them \"#braindump\" to get them out of your face.

I think a world where software artifacts can be easily run a decade later -- without any modification -- would be a significantly better world than the one we live in. In such a world, software would be part of the solution rather than the problem.\n\nSo, with that lengthy preamble, here's the draft I've been noodling on.\n\n*Draft: A programmer's pledge*\n\nGiven that:\n\u2022 We are on this planet for a brief time and will take nothing with us when we leave; and that\n\u2022 The effects of our actions compound for good and for ill, long after we are gone, in ways we cannot always anticipate; and that\n\u2022 I want to be helpful to others, and for the good in my actions to outweigh the bad; and that\n\u2022 I want to persuade you that I truly believe the above, that I want to be helpful more than I care about my own gain and aggrandizement;\nTherefore, I pledge to:\n\u2022 Tell you, when I build anything, what I hope to gain from it. If it's money I'll tell you how much in inflation-adjusted currency, and I'll commit to giving away anything beyond that while unencumbering any secrets it took to create it. If I create organizations or foundations around what I build, I'll enshrine these limits on value capture into their bylaws.\n\u2022 Tell you, up front, when it will be done. I'll provide a clear test for features I will add, and when I will stop adding features.\n\u2022 Show my thought process in my efforts to make it durable. Even after it's done, it might need changes to be runnable on people's computers. What have I done to minimize the likelihood of such changes? What have I learned from past projects that makes this one more durable than them?",

Furthermore I think about needed solutions/ideas a lot when offline (in the shower, during car drives, just before I go to sleep). I also keep a journal, make a lot of notes and I keep track of a backlog in which I mix actionable items and ideas I want to work on and specify further (I use google keep on my phone). \nPodcasts I listen to in my car, even on short trips for just a few minutes sometimes.\n\nI also wish I had more time to spend on my personal project and a lot of things take a lot of time and accepting that is sometimes hard. I also would like to make more videos about the project. But I currently prioritize working on the project over talking and making videos about it. Not taking it all to seriously helps me sometimes and focus more on having fun.",

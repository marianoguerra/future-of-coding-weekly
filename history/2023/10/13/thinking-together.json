I also read older books such as SmallTalk implementation and how it progressed from the early stages (1972) to later (1980). My favorite, although a bit heavy in syntax is the Dylan programming language <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_(programming_language)> It is sort of an Algol syntax for LISP-type language. I believe Julia is a somewhat of a relative of Dylan for modern languages.",

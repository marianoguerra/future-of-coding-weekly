Given <https://akkartik.name/freewheeling/|my past>, it won't surprise anyone that I mean to do this outside the morass of non-convivial software that is the modern web browser. My broad plan is:\n\n\u2022 L\u00d6VE v12 will support https, and <https://github.com/love2d/love/actions|release candidates> are already quite stable. Good enough to start building on.\n\u2022 I'll build my forum out of a server-side API in Lua and a client in L\u00d6VE v12. (Should be easy to support Windows, Linux, BSD and Android. Mac and iOS will require some annual contortions to build L\u00d6VE for oneself.)\n\u2022 The server side will of course be open source just like the client. In addition, all post/comment data will be published to a git repo on something like a daily basis.\nThe one major open question concerns authentication. How can we have stable identity? The above architecture is intended to allow anyone to host the forum (without trying to build galaxy-brain merkle trees, federated protocols or CRDTs), and I would prefer to not take a position of power as the source of everyone's hashed passwords (an intrinsically centralizing architecture).\n\nA few months ago someone showed me this ancient essay called <https://web.archive.org/web/20091126092028/http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2009/3/12/33338/3000|\"attacked from within\">, and I find myself thinking about it often. The whole thing is worth reading, but for this thread the crucial list of bullets halfway down is:\n\u2022 Registration keeps out good posters.\n\u2022 Registration lets in bad posters.\n\u2022 Registration attracts trolls.\n\u2022 Anonymity counters vanity.\nA provocative worldview that seems at least worth exploring. Keeping this in mind, I have a hazy idea that looks like this:\n\u2022 When you run the client you get to choose your handle, but it's not unique (cf. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle|Zooko's Triangle>)\n\u2022 When you run the client for the first time, it creates an RSA keypair for you.\n\u2022 When composing messages, the client signs the message with your private key (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#Signing_messages|description on Wikipedia>)\n\u2022 When rendering messages, the client validates the signature against your public key and shows something like an <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identicon|identicon> of the public key.\nImplications of this setup:\n\u2022 No registration\n\u2022 Your \"password\" (private key) never leaves your device(s).\n\u2022 When reading a thread you see a handle like `spiralganglion`. However, the handle is not authoritative. Next to it is an identicon that is authoritative.\n\u2022 It's easy in a thread to see if there are ever two people with the same handle but different identicons.\n\u2022 Since the client platform is starting from scratch, accessibility and internationalization will be a challenge for a long time :confused:\nNo guarantees this is all doable. It's quite possible the cryptographic operations will be untenably slow when implemented in Lua, and a native library for them would complicate the simple install story that is L\u00d6VE's greatest strength.\n\nBut I'm curious to get people's thoughts on this idea in principle.",

(And if it gets people here off Slack, I wouldn't be above spinning up a forum that forks this place.)\n\nSo I have zero grounds to pretend at any sort of knowledge or expertise on moderation. Mostly I figure, it looks like I have to get to this some time, the sooner I start, the more of a hope I have of learning to not suck at it. So your question about these gradations completely goes over my head. But ask me after I've been running something for a year.\n\nOh, one random note: Maybe pseudonymity makes harassment more difficult? It's easier in my system to create a new handle than it is on say ActivityPub. Does that seem to move the needle?",

I have a lot of appreciation for people who do it, like Ivan here -- and have successfully mooched off of their labors all these years.\n\nAnd yet, it's starting to feel like my projects need a central place of their own where someone can come see past questions and discussions that are currently only centralized in my notes. (And if it gets people here off Slack, I wouldn't be above spinning up a forum that forks this place.)\n\nSo I have zero grounds to pretend at any sort of knowledge or expertise on moderation. Mostly I figure, it looks like I have to get to this some time, the sooner I start, the more of a hope I have of learning to not suck at it. So your question about these gradations completely goes over my head. But ask me after I've been running something for a year.\n\nOh, one random note: Maybe pseudonymity makes harassment more difficult? It's easier in my system to create a new handle than it is on say ActivityPub. Does that seem to move the needle?"

They are discussion groups and are not devoted to publishing news. Newsgroups are technically distinct from, but functionally similar to, discussion forums on the World Wide Web. Newsreader software is used to read the content of newsgroups.\nBefore the adoption of the World Wide Web, Usenet newsgroups were among the most popular Internet services.\nCommunication is facilitated by the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) which allows connection to Usenet servers and data transfer over the internet.  Similar to another early (yet still used) protocol SMTP which is used for email messages, NNTP allows both server-server and client-server communication.  This means that newsgroups can be replicated from server to server which gives the Usenet network the ability to maintain a level of robust data persistence as a result of built-in data redundancy.  However, most users will access using only the client-server commands of NNTP and in almost all cases will use a GUI for browsing as opposed to command line based client-server communication specified in the NNTP protocol.",

Bringing together the histories of mathematics, computer science, and linguistic thought,\u00a0Language and the Rise of the Algorithm\u00a0reveals how recent developments in artificial intelligence are reopening an issue that troubled mathematicians well before the computer age: How do you draw the line between computational rules and the complexities of making systems comprehensible to people? By attending to this question, we come to see that the modern idea of the algorithm is implicated in a long history of attempts to maintain a disciplinary boundary separating technical knowledge from the languages people speak day to day. \u00a0 Here Jeffrey M. Binder offers a compelling tour of four visions of universal computation that addressed this issue in very different ways: G. W. Leibniz\u2019s calculus ratiocinator; a universal algebra scheme Nicolas de Condorcet designed during the French Revolution; George Boole\u2019s nineteenth-century logic system; and the early programming language ALGOL, short for\u00a0algorithmic language.\u00a0These episodes show that symbolic computation has repeatedly become entangled in debates about the nature of communication. Machine learning, in its increasing dependence on words, erodes the line between technical and everyday language, revealing the urgent stakes underlying this boundary. \u00a0 The idea of the algorithm is a levee holding back the social complexity of language, and it is about to break. This book is about the flood that inspired its construction.",

        "text": "That introduction sounds... well, it sounds like the author lives in a very different world than I do. He makes it sound like rigorous/non-natural languages are some conspiracy against communication, when the truth is that they keep convergently evolving because natural language simply does not do the job of communicating these things. People have tried doing math and computation in words over and over and it's miserable every time. \n\nMore to the point, the abstract idea of an algorithm is very specifically a tool for communication, and evolved the way it did to be more effective in that role. Any argument that wants to claim it's actually an obstacle has a very heavy lift in front of it, and nothing in that intro suggests the author is aware of that.\n\nI would further claim than any notion of LLMs (I assume this is what he's referring to as \"machine learning\"?) breaking this trend is an illusion. They will either evolve some form of rigor or (more likely) produce inscrutable messes.",

He makes it sound like rigorous/non-natural languages are some conspiracy against communication, when the truth is that they keep convergently evolving because natural language simply does not do the job of communicating these things. People have tried doing math and computation in words over and over and it's miserable every time. \n\nMore to the point, the abstract idea of an algorithm is very specifically a tool for communication, and evolved the way it did to be more effective in that role. Any argument that wants to claim it's actually an obstacle has a very heavy lift in front of it, and nothing in that intro suggests the author is aware of that.\n\nI would further claim than any notion of LLMs (I assume this is what he's referring to as \"machine learning\"?) breaking this trend is an illusion. They will either evolve some form of rigor or (more likely) produce inscrutable messes."

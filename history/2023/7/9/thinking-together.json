        "text": "&gt; Makes me wonder about other ways that being able to choose the size of representation in a program \u2014 independently from typical size units of code (ie: lines) \u2014 could be useful.\nOne place I would have loved this is when I was trying to grok Lisp interpreters. The classic Lisp interpreter looks something like this:\n\n```def eval(form, env):\n  case\n    ... -&gt; eval(..., env)\n    ... -&gt; eval(..., env)\n    ...\n  end\nend```\nBasically you have a large number of branches, and each of them has some complicated expression that passes `env` around. For more real-world codebases (like <https://github.com/arclanguage/anarki> or <http://www.paulgraham.com/bel.html>) each case might be complex enough to require a helper. In which case you now have a maze of _mutually_ recursive calls. And often the case that actually _uses_ `env` is just one line deep inside one of the helpers. All the other mentions of `env` exist just to plumb it through to that one line. It would be great to typeset all the mentions of `env` in small font size, but magnify the font size of `env` in that one line.\n\nAnd this is just one argument. If you look at Bel's source code, there's a half dozen such arguments being plumbed through in a similar pattern that would benefit from this sort of visual salience management.",

The poster child is <https://www.ubuntupit.com/best-latex-editor-reviewed-for-linux-nerds/#h-22-emacs-with-auctex|latex> but you can apply it to any kind of syntax-highlight.

Some young people, fresh to learning the craft are open to it, but not all. And while skepticism is important, ego is the main barrier.\n\nAs an industry, we also don't ask about it when grooming new recruits. We don't chat socially and say \"Who is your favorite coder or designer from the 60s, 70s,...\" etc. \"What UI from the past do you love and why?\" \"What are the most important, timeless values in software, to you?\" We don't learn from other great artists, stand on the shoulders of giants, and carry things forward to the extent artists do. It's one of our major failings."

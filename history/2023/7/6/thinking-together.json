Tell them about the joys of a simple reverse chronological timeline, where the vendor doesn't decide which posts to show you first. Tell them about the flexibility and compatibility that comes from open standards. Tell them about how decentralized systems are resilient against corporate censorship.\n\nAnd most importantly, don't ever build your own community within a walled garden like slack. :wink:",

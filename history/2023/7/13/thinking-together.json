However, I am excited about the potential of AI to help me make an app by generating code for me.\n\nTo answer your question Duncan - I've mostly been using a combination of asking chatGPT for the steps and code, and also using an app I am working on with a cofounder called Sublayer. We noticed that the chat interface is not really the best interface for building (and changing) complex apps, but we're still exploring the right workflow for it.

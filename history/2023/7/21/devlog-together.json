Ultimately, I just want to build my own editor that I can do all my programming in. I currently use emacs for clojure dev, vs code for writing most other things, and sublime text for browsing code (it is just faster).\n\nBut none of these am I happy with. I work in a very haphazard messy way. I have tons of files open but almost never need all of any one of those files. I want to be able to focus in on just parts of files. I want to be able to edit just that one function or consider just the data structures in my program.\n\n I love the live coding I get with emacs + clojure, but it locks up all the time and I can\u2019t do anything graphical. What I want is a way in which I can live code in any language, creating ad-hoc workflows and UIs for the problems I am currently facing. Why can\u2019t I easily draw a graph as I\u2019m coding? Why can\u2019t I easily run commands a, b, and c when I change functions x y or z?\n\nI also want a better interface for debugging. When I\u2019m doing rust development I do find a stepping debugger useful, but there are so much things that make them annoying to use. A very common workflow is that you have some breakpoint you are interested in, but only when you get to a certain point in a program. The UI for doing this shouldn\u2019t be hard but none support it.\n\nUltimately for me, it is a complete rethinking of the way I work with code. But I have kept the constraint that I am editing text. For clojure I\u2019ll have something like paredit. But I don\u2019t think for my personal use cases I\u2019d get most of my benefit out of a structural editor. Instead, it is all the meta work around programming that I want to make better. I have a lot of concrete use cases I\u2019d love to support.

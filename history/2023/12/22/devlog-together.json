This gives an effect of picking up a definition above the surface when pressing down the mouse. I also started showing the \"padding\" I resolve collisions within to give more of a hint for what's going to happen when I let go of the mouse.\n\nThe final refinement is something you can see in the first half of the video: if I drop the definition back close to its original location, nothing moves. Acts like undo when I change my mind after picking up a definition."

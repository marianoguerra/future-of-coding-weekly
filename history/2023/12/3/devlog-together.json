The power usage when idle is basically non-existent (down from 100% cpu usage always). I finally feel like things are starting to come together and that I can finish up some parts and then really start focusing on actually making the flow and features fit how I code.\n\nHopefully soon I can start using it for a project that isn't coding itself so I am forced to add all the features I've been ignoring."

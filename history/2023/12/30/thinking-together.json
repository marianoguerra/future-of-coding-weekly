There are other ways to slice things up I\u2019m sure. But regardless of the division, I don\u2019t see why we would want to do that. \n\nI don\u2019t think these activities form a natural kind. So it doesn\u2019t seem we are trying to get at the truth by making these divisions. Instead we are trying to rank them. We are trying to say some of these are more sophisticated or nobler than the other. \u201cThat\u2019s just programming, not true software engineering\u201d. \n\nI especially don\u2019t understand the point of drawing a distinction between programming and software engineering. What do we gain by making this distinction? Is the act of planning how to write a program really not part of the programming activity? If I\u2019m drawing up plans for how I\u2019m going to make a chair, am I really involved in an activity distinctly different from wood working?\n\nBy drawing these distinctions we also open the door for the division of labor to occur. This creates the awful concept of \u201carchitect\u201d. The perhaps most harmful concept we\u2019ve ever created as a profession. ",

Part of it is that thinking imperatively (i.e. predicting how a computer will do this) is a rare skill we've acquired through huge effort and trauma that's both incredibly powerful, in that it lets us occasionally do low level crazy shit to get close to optimal solutions... And another huge part is that many, many, many extremely valuable regions have no known effective declarative implementation techniques."

A lot of what falls under the banner of software engineering is no more complex than writing 50 lines of code to reformat blog entries. The way in which I think about doing these activities is the same. The kinds of decisions you have to make to do them is the same. I am spending hours and hours of my time right now at work resolving merge conflicts from a fork that stopped tracking upstream. It is all to support things at a massive industrial scale. But my activity is writing a little clojure script that shells out to help me manage git patches. Is this software engineering? Does it change it if the resolutions here are for a compiler?",

A lot of what falls under the banner of software engineering is no more complex than writing 50 lines of code to reformat blog entries. The way in which I think about doing these activities is the same. The kinds of decisions you have to make to do them is the same. I am spending hours and hours of my time right now at work resolving merge conflicts from a fork that stopped tracking upstream. It is all to support things at a massive industrial scale. But my activity is writing a little clojure script that shells out to help me manage git patches. Is this software engineering? Does it change it if the resolutions here are for a compiler?"

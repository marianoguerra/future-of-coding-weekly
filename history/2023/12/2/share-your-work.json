It\u2019s a VR version of turtle graphics with some interactive program stepping and 3D visualizations of things like state change and execution history.\nI made a trailer you can watch (and listen to :notes:) here <https://youtu.be/Fl3DjzTdUo8?si=bWi7CWwbXIQh_wUw>. If you have a Quest headset and want to try it out, I set up a Beta release while I try to get it into Meta\u2019s App Lab app store. This link <https://www.meta.com/s/2Rlda8ess> should work otherwise feel free to DM me the email address associated with your Oculus/Meta account.\nI also have some time-stamped/annotated videos later on in this Youtube Playlist (<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhmEEtPzG7mW4JrBUhwbo3al6HjaJsDp2> ) in case you want to see more.\nI\u2019m more of a lurker in this slack, but it\u2019s a community I enjoy checking on and it\u2019s really cool to see it grow!",

Using simple commands, you can control Pebbles the dog to draw lines and shapes with programming. You can also step through your programs interactively, and see unique 3D visualizations of how things change over time. Pebble Graphics is a fun and creative way to learn basic ideas in programming.",

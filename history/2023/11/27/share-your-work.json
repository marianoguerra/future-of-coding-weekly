However, along the way I've built some libraries which may be of interest to some people here.\n\nOn the languages and parsing side, I've built <https://github.com/jhp/recursive-grammar-literal|recursive grammar literals> which lets you write CFGs as normal javascript functions. And <https://github.com/jhp/church-cat|church-cat> which lets you compute over a tree structure, e.g. annotate a parse tree.\n\nOn the UI side I've built <https://github.com/jhp/imperative|imperative> which is a frontend javascript library much like React, but based on generators and structured concurrency. And most recently I've been working on <https://github.com/jhp/palimpsest|Palimpsest> which covers the backend of web development with a more functional or \"event-sourced\" style where data sources are computed as folds over input streams. My interest there is to allow stateful applications to be more easily shared, forked, and extended by their users etc.",

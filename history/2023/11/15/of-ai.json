[...] Specifically, I\u2019m worried about the cultural effects: people with AI romantic partners, people getting arrested for mistreating their computers, people committing their life to the illusion that they\u2019ll live on in a computer realm, people further reduced to despair and nihilism on the reductionistic assumption that consciousness is just computation, people electing computers to positions of power (and being castigated as backwards oppressors if they don\u2019t acknowledge personhood in the algorithms), people bowing down and worshipping code (while paying its priests money), etc. In short, I\u2019m worried much more about the human folly than the dangers of the technological advance itself."

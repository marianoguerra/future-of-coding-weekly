Permissions - they can't do it without your permission. Choice - well it's up to you if you want to do that, I'm not stopping you.\n\nThanks for the links, I'll look at them, apart from the Solid one, which isn't really related. Yes, you have online hosting for your data, which does bring in a little trust element, which I suppose is fine. Plus you have more control over it, which is good. I recall data is in standard types, which is also good.\n\nBut there's still the whole \"inert, zombie\" data aspect - data is lifeless until animated by some app, probably a browser app, which is right back to the same problem of app inscrutability.",

Permissions - they can't do it without your permission. Choice - well it's up to you if you want to do that, I'm not stopping you.\n\nThanks for the links, I'll look at them, apart from the Solid one, which isn't really related. Yes, you have online hosting for your data, which does bring in a little trust element, which I suppose is fine. Plus you have more control over it, which is good. I recall data is in standard types, which is also good.\n\nBut there's still the whole \"inert, zombie\" data aspect - data is lifeless until animated by some app, probably a browser app, which is right back to the same problem of app inscrutability."

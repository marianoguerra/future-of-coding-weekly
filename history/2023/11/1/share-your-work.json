Thrilled to share the open beta launch of MightyMeld, a visual dev tool for React I've been building with some friends of mine. <https://www.mightymeld.com/>\n\nJust posted this blog post telling the story and why I'm excited -- <https://mightymeld.com/blog/open-beta>\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts! I'm a former academic who's been driven into industry out of a desire to make the theoretical practical. MightyMeld is a \"visual coding\" that is not like any kind of \"visual coding\" i would've imagined if we hadn't've built this thing starting from real production code and saying \"how can we make this more visual\".",

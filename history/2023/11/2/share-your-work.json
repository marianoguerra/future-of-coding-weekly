However, there's no need to do a different render for 2D and 3D: it'll be the same one. I'm thinking neuomorphic in both. (It's using Vulkan for both, underneath.)\n\nYou wouldn't get a CV if you printed it, no, you'd have to jump the link from the contact card to the person's CV. If you were viewing the contact in 2D, then expanded the embedded link to the CV - seen as a smaller panel inside the contact, then hit \"print\", you'd get what you saw, with the CV.\n\nSo yes, there's both some hard coding of behaviours of objects, and a default render of any standard recognised object type. But you can extend both.\n\nYou suggest AI help for programming? And working at a higher conceptual level? I've probably over-summarised your point, so apologies there. So, I'm not working on AI or AI-to-human, etc., conceptual languages, except the programming language is declarative so intended to be humane, unlike imperative ones. It's what I call a \"Domain and Target Independent Language\" that is meant to be general purpose and conceptually intuitive without being Nat Lang.",

However, there's no need to do a different render for 2D and 3D: it'll be the same one. I'm thinking neuomorphic in both. (It's using Vulkan for both, underneath.)\n\nYou wouldn't get a CV if you printed it, no, you'd have to jump the link from the contact card to the person's CV. If you were viewing the contact in 2D, then expanded the embedded link to the CV - seen as a smaller panel inside the contact, then hit \"print\", you'd get what you saw, with the CV.\n\nSo yes, there's both some hard coding of behaviours of objects, and a default render of any standard recognised object type. But you can extend both.\n\nYou suggest AI help for programming? And working at a higher conceptual level? I've probably over-summarised your point, so apologies there. So, I'm not working on AI or AI-to-human, etc., conceptual languages, except the programming language is declarative so intended to be humane, unlike imperative ones. It's what I call a \"Domain and Target Independent Language\" that is meant to be general purpose and conceptually intuitive without being Nat Lang."

This allows you to create, edit and link objects. That's fixing the \"Balkanisation\" \"app trap\" - so you can mash up lots of little objects of diverse types, any way you like.\n\nThen next I'll continue on the P2P protocol I started, focusing on cryptography stuff and proxy, cache and router functions. That's fixing the \"Big Tech\" \"app trap\", of course!\n\nFinally, I'll get back to porting my programming language from Java to C!

Tasks like \"add a new entry to my agenda\" are imperative. And since I'd expect to be able to script everything I do by hand, I also expect to have an imperative scripting language.\nWhat I see as the mistake in the Smalltalk approach (and many others) is the idea of a single universal computational paradigm that applies from integer addition and string manipulation to user-level interactions."

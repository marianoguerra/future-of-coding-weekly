It's quite powerful .. the created nodes can receive and visualize input data from another node. This is offcourse inspired by makeitreal from tldraw which uses gpt4-vision-preview. I have been playing with the prompt to get the result that I wanted, although the results are not consistent when recreating the html using the same prompt. Still, very cool that this is possible.\n\n<https://youtu.be/WkyB8sdtiZ0|https://youtu.be/WkyB8sdtiZ0>\n",

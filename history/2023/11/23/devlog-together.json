One of them dropped out from the program when they joined a research lab. (Hey wait \u2014 that was me!) The other two researchers work highly independently. But, when they write a new note, or record a demo video, they share it in a private I&S discord channel so that other folks at the lab can offer feedback. These researchers also sometimes join the weekly Monday+Friday staff calls so they can briefly share what they're up to, just to keep the rest of the lab up to date. The residence is not paid, and the primary benefit (so far) is that you get to use the lab staff as \"study buddies\" so to speak.\n\nIn short, it's basically like a smaller, less casual version of what we already do with <#C03RR0W5DGC|devlog-together>, <#C0120A3L30R|two-minute-week>, and <#CCL5VVBAN|share-your-work>.\n\nThere's no always-on video calls that people drop in and out of. There's no obligation for anyone at the lab to give feedback. Quite the opposite \u2014 it's an opportunity for these researchers to write a regular series of short notes, and record short demos, and share them with a small group of other people who have enough context to be able to offer valuable feedback if they have any. It entirely depends on the researchers putting in the extra effort to make their work legible, interesting, and quickly digestible (which is good practice). It depends on the researchers having the free (unpaid) time to do all this work.\n\nAll that being said, if a small group of you would like to commit to each other that you'll regularly communicate your work in a way that makes it legible and quickly digestible, I'd be happy to spin up a channel for it. It'd be a dedicated space where you'd share and discuss your work with each other, and the rest of the community could sort of observe at a remove and perhaps toss in a bit of feedback if they ever had any.",

One of them dropped out from the program when they joined a research lab. (Hey wait \u2014 that was me!) The other two researchers work highly independently. But, when they write a new note, or record a demo video, they share it in a private I&S discord channel so that other folks at the lab can offer feedback. These researchers also sometimes join the weekly Monday+Friday staff calls so they can briefly share what they're up to, just to keep the rest of the lab up to date. The residence is not paid, and the primary benefit (so far) is that you get to use the lab staff as \"study buddies\" so to speak.\n\nIn short, it's basically like a smaller, less casual version of what we already do with "

Quite the opposite \u2014 it's an opportunity for these researchers to write a regular series of short notes, and record short demos, and share them with a small group of other people who have enough context to be able to offer valuable feedback if they have any. It entirely depends on the researchers putting in the extra effort to make their work legible, interesting, and quickly digestible (which is good practice). It depends on the researchers having the free (unpaid) time to do all this work.\n\nAll that being said, if a small group of you would like to commit to each other that you'll regularly communicate your work in a way that makes it legible and quickly digestible, I'd be happy to spin up a channel for it. It'd be a dedicated space where you'd share and discuss your work with each other, and the rest of the community could sort of observe at a remove and perhaps toss in a bit of feedback if they ever had any."

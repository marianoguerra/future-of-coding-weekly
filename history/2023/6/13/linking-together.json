But I'm not sure it's far to say that the thing Bret was demoing is what has been productized here. _See where a character's jump will land_ is but one of the many kinds of debug visualization that have always been ubiquitous in game dev, and Mario Maker is quite literally just _game dev as a product_. Pretty much every platformer game will have dev tooling to help visually quantify whether or not the player can readily make a given jump. And yes, some of them do it with an onion-skin effect, like Bret and Mario Maker 2, because that's a classic visualization technique when working with frame-based animation. (Eg: Flash had it built-in to the editor.) Here's <https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0005|another> example of visualization to debug character movement.\n\nBut the more general point Bret was trying to make with this example \u2014 that you should have an immediate preview of what your code is doing, and you should be able to abstract that preview across a range of system configurations (see also <http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/|Ladder of Abstraction>, of course) \u2014 is not _quite_ what this particular feature in game dev tools achieves. For instance, I'm not sure how common it is for games to have the sort of deterministic time-travel bret was playing with. Rather, they tend to just forward-project from a chosen starting configuration. That's why the <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72y2EC5fkcE|Tomorrow Corp Tech Demo> was so impressive. The deeper interpretation of Bret's stuff is still on the fringes.",

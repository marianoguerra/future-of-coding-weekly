It feels to me like this involves setting out data governance policies that say things akin to \"don't give access to personally identifying information unless the user has admin privileges\", and then what happens is that the people running the software need to configure their tools to comply with that rule. That feels like it would a) make it more complicated to add new tools, driving organizations to centralize, and b) be difficult for the people writing the policy, who presumably don't know the software tools, to confirm has been implemented correctly. I'm presuming that they do some form of user testing to see if they can find violations, but they don't validate the configurations directly, and there is nothing in the way of real-time or near-real-time auditing. Is that more or less how it goes? Or is the tooling more sophisticated than that?",

If the View isn't the app, just the View, and the underlying data and operations are in the Model, then you can have multiple kinds of views, possibility at the same time. Just like the classic MVC example where data (from the Model) appears in both a grid and a pie chart (2 Views) at the same time. A model can have a standard GUI View but also a separate text-to-speech UI. We did this with the ChromeOS system calculator by having a separate CalcSpeechView which was invisible from the traditional GUI point of view, but worked with screen readers to provide speech output: <https://github.com/foam-framework/foam/blob/2966cde661ccadbb8b1548fede78f6d67cc53ed5/js/foam/apps/calc/CalcSpeechView.js>",

If the View isn't the app, just the View, and the underlying data and operations are in the Model, then you can have multiple kinds of views, possibility at the same time. Just like the classic MVC example where data (from the Model) appears in both a grid and a pie chart (2 Views) at the same time. A model can have a standard GUI View but also a separate text-to-speech UI. We did this with the ChromeOS system calculator by having a separate CalcSpeechView which was invisible from the traditional GUI point of view, but worked with screen readers to provide speech output: "

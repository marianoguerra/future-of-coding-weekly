In my application, \u201cmultidimensional data\u201d is basically just like rows in a typical database, where each column in the database is a \u201cdimension\u201d. A key difference is that \u201cdimensions\u201d can be re-used in multiple tables and used for joining and comparing across datasets.\n\nThe primary function I hope to use snapshots for is not data-entry, though. It\u2019s \u201cdata modeling\u201d and experimentation. E.g. Setting up data visualizations and control knobs on a canvas interface. So, if someone accidentally deletes a canvas of control knobs and visualizations, that canvas can be restored from a week ago through browsing this \u201csnapshot history\u201d",

In my application, \u201cmultidimensional data\u201d is basically just like rows in a typical database, where each column in the database is a \u201cdimension\u201d. A key difference is that \u201cdimensions\u201d can be re-used in multiple tables and used for joining and comparing across datasets.\n\nThe primary function I hope to use snapshots for is not data-entry, though. It\u2019s \u201cdata modeling\u201d and experimentation. E.g. Setting up data visualizations and control knobs on a canvas interface. So, if someone accidentally deletes a canvas of control knobs and visualizations, that canvas can be restored from a week ago through browsing this \u201csnapshot history\u201d"

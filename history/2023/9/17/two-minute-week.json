Normally applications created with CodeParadise have a highly interactive character and communicate with a server environment.\n\nA new feature allows a running tiny image to be saved and restarted later as a Single Page Application. A sealed snapshot is made, meaning the connection with the server environment is removed. All code running inside the browser (in the tiny image) is saved in the snapshot as well as the current DOM. After the snapshot is restarted the application will create the same DOM structure and rehydrate the WebComponents and you'll have a running application again!\n\nFor a short video see: <https://youtu.be/9YUXYuo_HaM>\nOr go to the resulting SPA at: <https://codeparadise.nl/blog-example> (open the browser inspector to see all the WebComponents)\nHappy coding!",

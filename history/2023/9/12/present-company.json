You can <https://spiralganglion.bandcamp.com/track/dont-do-math|listen to it here.>\n\nCan I find a way to make this even vaguely relevant to you, members of the FoC community, other than merely the personal connection we share? Why yes! It's a song about meaning and interpretation, things that I love thinking about when programming and detest thinking about when creative writing. I had to pick some subject, thus: what's something wryly confrontational I can say to all my programmer friends? Don't do math! Stop it. Don't think about it. Don't look for meaning. Stop formalizing, stop proving. Stop saying \"easy to reason about\".\n\nFor those who enjoy this sort of thing, the song is also loaded with music-math \"jokes\" \u2014 collect them all! Microtones, time signature changes, polyrhythm, polymeter, isometer, hocketing, \u2026 I even count-in at the beginning (and yes, the first bar comes in waaay early).\n\nEnjoy.",

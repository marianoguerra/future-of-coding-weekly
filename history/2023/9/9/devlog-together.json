(<https://lethallava.land/notes/9if8o9ngl13900d9>)\n\n- So I saved my Takeout files to Google Drive (not yet taken out! <https://merveilles.town/@akkartik/110892364898712223>)\n\n- Then I had to find a way to get files out of Google Drive. Which leads to the above page.\n\nGoogle should be required to report reading burdens like the OMB does for US govt. forms.",

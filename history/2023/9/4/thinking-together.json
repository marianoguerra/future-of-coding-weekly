Quite frequently, one topic can be spread across 5+ apps/website. My less than ideal solution is to introduce another aggregator app (roam research in my case) and paste &amp; tags different links when possible. Arc browser spaces also helps with that. The issue is that it's very manual and not worth for small ad hoc topic and researches.\n\nIs this a problem you are facing? How do you solve/work-around it? Any interesting links on the topic?\n\nI believe it could &amp; should be solved at the OS level and found really interesting project: <https://playb.it/>, MercuryOS, <https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/000/> but I feel like there should be more",

        "text": "In Episode 66 there was a long discussion about an idea I've come to know as _the reality of abstractions_. I got that phrasing from David Deutsch in The Beginning Of Infinity.\n\nI've long wanted to write about this in connection to programming, where we talk a lot about \"abstractions\", but in a very different sense* to the way Deutsch does. In lieu of doing that (which sounds like a lot of work) I will just post some of my favourite Deutsch quotes about it.\n\n&gt; Reductionism and holism are both mistakes. In reality, explanations do not form a hierarchy with the lowest level being the most fundamental. Rather, explanations at any level of emergence can be fundamental. Abstract entities are real, and can play a role in causing physical phenomena. Causation is itself such an abstraction.\n&gt; When we use theories about emergent physical quantities to explain the behaviour of water in a kettle, we are using an abstraction - an \u2018idealized\u2019 model of the kettle that ignores most of its details - as an approximation to a real physical system. But when we use a computer to investigate prime numbers, we are doing the reverse: we are using the physical computer as an approximation to an abstract one which perfectly models prime numbers. Unlike any real computer, the latter never goes wrong, requires no maintenance, and has unlimited memory and unlimited time to run its program.\n&gt; Abstractions are essential to a fuller explanation. You know that if your computer beats you at chess, it is really the program that has beaten you, not the silicon atoms or the computer as such. _[Nor, I would add, the arrangements of pixels on the screen which symbolize knights, pawns, etc.]_ The abstract program is instantiated physically as a high-level behaviour of vast numbers of atoms, but the explanation of why it has beaten you cannot be expressed without also referring to the program in its own right. That program has also been instantiated, unchanged, in a long chain of different physical substrates, including neurons in the brains of the programmers and radio waves when you downloaded the program via wireless networking, and finally as states of long- and short-term memory banks in your computer. The specifics of that chain of instantiations may be relevant to explaining how the program reached you, but it is irrelevant to why it beat you: there, the content of the knowledge (in it, and in you) is the whole story. That story is an explanation that refers ineluctably to abstractions; and therefore those abstractions exist, and really do affect physical objects in the way required by the explanation.\nTo connect this to the content of the episode - I think all the different representations of a cube on a screen are \"real\". The parts that you might dismiss as not having an \"effect on the world\", like the data structures in RAM, or the textual representation stored on disk, are as unavoidably real at their own levels of abstraction.\n\n*Colloquially, I think working programmers use \"abstraction\" to mean things ranging from \"I can ignore the details 'below' this point\" to \"I can <https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0015|compress> this implementation into fewer syntax tokens\". A <https://www.pathsensitive.com/2022/03/abstraction-not-what-you-think-it-is.html|contrary view> from Dijkstra, which I think is closer to Deutsch's view, is abstraction as \"a new semantic layer in which one can be absolutely precise\".",

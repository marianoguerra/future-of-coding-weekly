You can put in bookmarks, either actual paper ones, or just fingers slipped into the middle of the manuscript stack. You can annotate the manuscript for yourself with comments like \"Fix this!\" or \"Don't forget to check these facts\" without there being any possibility of you missing them when you next work on the document. And you can mark a block, either by circling it with your pen, or by physically cutting it out, without necessarily having to do anything with it right away. The entire document is your workspace.\n&gt; On a typewritten page, on the other hand, you are forced to deal with the next sequential character. Your thoughts are focussed serially on the typing of the document. If you're in the middle of a line halfway down page 7, your only easy option is to continue on that line. To go backwards to check something is difficult, to put in a comment that won't show when your document is read by somebody else is impossible, and so on. Typing is a top-down, linear process, not at all conducive to the intuitive, leaping-here-and-there kind of thought human beings are good at.",

Imagine: I could work on my text right in the university library, with all sources at hand! There was a learning curve to WordStar, but after a week I was as efficient as I ever was later with whatever other software.\n\nToday, my main writing tools is Emacs. Its org-mode has a rich choice of informal markup, i.e. markup that is not interpreted by Emacs itself but still relatively easy to process semi-automatically via keyboard macros. That's great for the use cases described in this article. The tough part is being consistent in my own use of this markup. One day I'll write a linter - one day.",

Imagine: I could work on my text right in the university library, with all sources at hand! There was a learning curve to WordStar, but after a week I was as efficient as I ever was later with whatever other software.\n\nToday, my main writing tools is Emacs. Its org-mode has a rich choice of informal markup, i.e. markup that is not interpreted by Emacs itself but still relatively easy to process semi-automatically via keyboard macros. That's great for the use cases described in this article. The tough part is being consistent in my own use of this markup. One day I'll write a linter - one day."

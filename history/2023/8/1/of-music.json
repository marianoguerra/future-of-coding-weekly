Developing theories about monads will never help you create content as good as what Jimmy Webb created.  No type-checked language is ever going to touch as many humans as \u201cThe Witchitaw Lineman\u201d.  An interesting question is \u201cWhy?\u201c.  I think that Raskin\u2019s \u201cThe Humane Interface\u201d was just beginning to scratch the surface of this question, along with Norman\u2019s \u201cThe Design of Everyday Things\u201d.\n\nIn songwriting, there is the concept of \u201cco-writing\u201d.  1+1=3.

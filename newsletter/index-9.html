<p>A new object was added to Automat over the last week - it's the final one that is needed for the MVP to work. And it does work! I've recorded myself writing a small C++ program and the macro recorder replayed it correctly ^^</p>
<p>I guess I'll start posting Automat updates to Mastodon :) Here is the first one - a new Macro Recorder object was added this week!</p>

<p>If you're anything like me (oof, sorry), you've heard of <a href="https://worrydream.com/refs/Smith_DC_1975_-_Pygmalion.pdf">Pygmalion</a> but never caught more than the gist. Some sort of project from the early 70s, similar to Sketchpad or Smalltalk or something, yet another promising prototype from the early history of our field that failed to take the world by storm. Our stock-in-trade on this show.</p>
<p>But you've probably heard of Programming by Demonstration. And you've certainly heard of  <em>icons</em>  — you know, those little pictures that have become indelibly part of computing as we know it. Pygmalion is the originator of these concepts… and more!</p>
<p>The best introduction to Pygmalion is <a href="https://twitter.com/warianoguerra">Mariano Guerra</a>'s <a href="https://instadeq.com/blog/posts/no-code-history-pygmalion-1975/">No-code History: Pygmalion</a>, which includes a clearly articulated summary of the big ideas, motivation, and design, with a video demonstration of the programming interface, key terminology, and links.</p>
<p>The  <em>most</em>  introduction to Pygmalion — or Pig Million, The Millionth Pig, as it'll surely come to be known — is the subject of today's episode: the original paper by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Canfield_Smith">David Canfield Smith</a>.</p>

<p>I've just learned about Alternate Reality Kit. I've searched through the archive and it was mentioned in passing a couple of times but I don't think this article was ever posted: <a href="https://worrydream.com/refs/Smith_R_1987_-_Experiences_With_The_Alternate_Reality_Kit,_An_Example_of_the_Tension_Between_Literalism_and_Magic.pdf">Experiences With The Alternate Reality Kit
An Example of the Tension Between Literalism and Magic</a> . There is also a relatively recent video upload (video comes from 87 but it was uploaded only three years ago) which shows a more mature version in action: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1HhPE0zV6g">The Alternate Reality Kit</a> .</p>
<p>Its similarity to the system that I'm developing is just uncanny! I'm very interested in learning more about it. I tried to follow its history to figure out why it was abandoned but I've only been able to track that its development eventually led to the Self language (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ka4KY7TMTU">Self and Self: Whys and Wherefores</a>) which honestly seems like a step back from the original. I have my theories about why it might have been abandoned (which is that educational software is hard to sell) but would love to learn more about it from the people who might know more. Or maybe there are other systems that might have been derived from it?</p>

<p>I don't know, but I have my hypothesis as well as for why this and other user-empowering approaches were abandoned: the rise of PCs. In the late 80s and early 90s, the first PCs appeared and were seen as the obvious road to computing for everyone. But they were not powerful enough to run environments like Smalltalk. It's Basic we got instead. In parallel, professional high-end computing grew as well and that's where the money was. Academia followed the money.</p>

<p><strong>@Joel Jakubovic</strong>’s thesis should be interesting to folks here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Achieving Self-Sustainability in Interactive Graphical Programming Systems</em> 
Programming is fraught with accidental complexity. Software, including tools used for programming, is inflexible and hard to adapt to one's specific problem context. Programming tools do not support Notational Freedom, so programmers must waste cognitive effort expressing ideas in suboptimal notations. They must also work around problems caused by a reliance on plain text representations instead of Explicit Structure.</p>
<p>The idea of a Self-Sustainable programming system, open to adaptation by its users, promises a way out of these accidental complexities. However, the principles underlying such a property are poorly documented, as are methods for practically achieving it in harmony with Notational Freedom and Explicit Structure. We trace the causes of this difficulty and use them to inform our construction of a prototype self-sustainable system. By carefully reflecting on the steps involved in our specific case, we provide insight into how self-sustainability can be achieved in general, and thus how a motivated programmer can escape the aforementioned sources of accidental complexity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This new website gives access to 50+ years of work by Alexander and colleagues at CES. The goal of this continuing endeavor is to share the work with all who wish to build and repair living environments in which people thrive.
In total, the Archive includes some 29,000 items. About 50% of them have been catalogued to date and are listed on the website. Around 6000 items have been digitized and are now available from the website as downloads. As funding allows, we will work toward making the whole collection available.</p>

<p>I am currently thinking about working on one or more of these ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>visual pl for creating your own compiler</li>
<li>visual pl for spreadsheet creation and customization </li>
<li>visual pl for making domain specific languages </li>
</ul>
<p>I will probably converge on a visual programming language with a spreadsheet GUI that compiles to WebAssembly. Any resources for intuition about compilers, spreadsheets, or DSLs that help me understand these topics would much appreciate.</p>

<p>If the problem you're chasing doesn't quite fit in any of these buckets, please share it in a similar format. (One sentence, not describing a solution.) If it does fit one or more of these buckets, please mention them. (Alternative wordings are also appreciated, but for me the primary goal here is to cluster ourselves.)</p>

<p>we keep telling computers how to work instead of what they should do</p>

<p>Oh, and they even added Bret Victor style variable "scrubbing".</p>
<p>(Desktop also got builtin Math Notes, minus handwriting, briefly flashed 51:57 — looks very much like <a href="http://Calca.io">Calca.io</a> / Soulver / NoteCalc etc.?)</p>
<p>So, are we "Magic Ink" yet?  (I'm not so much thinking of Bret Victor's essay as Ink&amp;Switch's experiments like <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/inkbase/">inkandswitch.com/inkbase</a>, CrossCut &amp; Untangle ...)</p>
<p>On one hand nothing revolutionary, spreadsheets had much more power for decades.</p>
<p>And yet a solid chunk of useful functionality is starting to move into taken-for-granted "this is just how futuristic paper  <em>naturally</em>  works" territory 👏.</p>
<p>I expect long term it might make such "what-if" explorations accessible¹ to more people, and more importantly prepare people for more complex interactions on top?</p>
<p>¹ well, once/IF it waters down to lower-end hardware.  Good-enough stylus tech remains expensive enough to be niche,  <em>not</em>  evenly distributed 😞</p>

<p>I always thought field was well ahead of its time. Prefigured a lot of Bret Victor's demos and future of coding work that followed in 'real world' use.. Happy to see it is still active. Has anyone used it?</p>

<p>anyone around here working in a R&amp;D department ? I need some pointers. Thanks!</p>

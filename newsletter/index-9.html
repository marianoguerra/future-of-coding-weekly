<p>This week in Automat was mostly refactoring and bug squashing so not much to show. Except today I've sat down and designed the object that will act as a flip-flop switch. The first three images are the candidates for the final object. I'm actually still not decided which one to go for... The others images are just interesting results  obtained from prompting stable diffusion</p>

<p>Been a while since I touched it but I've been <a href="https://github.com/cben/animation-stack-language">building</a> a toy postfix stack-based language to inflict upon my kids.  My theory is:</p>
<ul>
<li>postfix may have benefits for early teaching (linear evaluation order, lack of "syntax", trivial notional machine)</li>
<li>the obvious drawbacks can be somewhat mitigated if instead of destructively changing the stack, you can navigate all previous stack states.  (I'm not the first to try the latter; in particular Kartik did it in Mu, including descending into function calls. I don't even have user-defined functions yet.)</li>
<li>I wanted to explore "replacing" some uses of control structures with composition of a bigger data type, like a whole picture or animation.  </li>
</ul>
<p>I'm resigned to the thing not being turing-complete.</p>
<p>Initial implementation's data type was <a href="https://asciinema.org/a/zObMq9ZLJQNA99X3EhdEDllhA">1D "animation" of color change (I wanted them to program an RGB lamp)</a></p>
<p>=&gt; My kids liked typing and mixing colors, but the idea of a single value representing change over time went entirely over their heads 😞</p>
<p>Anyway terminal REPL was a dead end, because you can't go back and edit past code.  =&gt; I got a prototype web editor — you can move cursor, edit freely, and see stack state before each word: <a href="https://animation-stack-language.netlify.app/">animation-stack-language.netlify.app</a></p>
<p>TODO: rendering still uses styled block characters 🧑‍💻, I need to learn canvas...</p>
<p>TODO: Next big step will be to replace the data type from 1D "time" to 2D "picture", taking inspiration from <a href="http://forthsalon.appspot.com">forthsalon.appspot.com</a> and <a href="https://code.world/">code.world </a>.</p>
<p>I'm thinking to make do with some 2D rather than RGB colorspace, so that every pixel can also be interpreted as a vector.  That way any picture doubles as a limited representation of function-as-data (not turing-complete! but very visual 🤔).</p>

<p>I made a blog post about <a href="https://calcwithdec.dev/posts/viz-risk/">visualizing risk</a></p>
<p>It's a scrollable explanation that develops up a visualization - a bit going on in it, a problem I have with a lot of things, so was really glad to spend time learning a few things about making this kind of scrollable interaction to more carefully introduce things.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, the numbers are from a calculang model doing monte carlo simulations on a pension calculator calculang model. This composability (or what I call flexibility) is something I decided not to make  <em>this</em>  post about, but it's an important part of why calculang exists.</p>
<p>I plan to do a few similar separate exercises, and then spin back to this on it's own. (e.g. next: benchmarking actual results to their older estimates)</p>
<p>So, this blog post isn't really technical, but I hope it's interesting or at least easy to follow, and it fits into a longer piece about calculang. Happy if you have any feedback about the post or questions about this longer piece!</p>

<p>I've been building a sync framework that app developers can integrate, to securely sync state changes between clients. I call it DIPLOMATIC, after the concept of a diplomatic bag which travels through foreign territories, but protected against inspection. So far I've got a couple host implementations targeting Deno and Cloudflare (Workers + Durable Objects + D1), as well as client libraries to build web clients in React and CLI tools in Deno.</p>
<p>The attached video shows off a demo app that displays and updates a consistent status message across clients. It generates and stores a cryptographic seed (synced via the browser's password manager), queues status changes when offline or not connected to a host, then pushes queued changes when connected, and receives real-time updates using WebSockets.</p>
<p>I've got some rough docs up at <a href="https://diplomatic-docs.replit.app">diplomatic-docs.replit.app</a>, and a walkthrough of the demo app from the video at <a href="https://diplomatic-docs.replit.app/docs/demos/status.html">diplomatic-docs.replit.app/docs/demos/status.html</a>.</p>
<p>The backstory is that, for a while I've wanted to build a grand life-planning app, like a TODO list that can operate at the decade-level rather than the daily-level. But I kept running into these blocks:</p>
<p>a) I'll want to access it from phone and desktop, so it needs a sync solution,</p>
<p>b) maintaining servers is a pain, and</p>
<p>c) a life-planning tool will necessarily have personal info, so it shouldn't hang out in plaintext on someone else's computers.</p>
<p>These sorts of issues aren't unique to this tool. In fact, I think they're common enough to merit a general solution. The Web 2.0 client/server model gave us easy software updates and access from multiple devices with consistent data. But we backslid by making all app data visible to the software provider and relying on them to maintain their servers. Mobile apps gave us the additional expectation that we could access our data while offline.</p>
<p>I think there's a simple solution to get the best of all worlds, by encoding app state changes as objects (the Event Sourcing pattern), then encrypting those deltas and shipping them off to a server which relays to other clients, which then decrypt and apply the changes locally. With this architecture, the relay servers all have a standard interface (not application-specific), and they're blind to delta contents, so hosting becomes a commodity. This means companies could specialize in just running these hosts, giving application developers a secure backend without the maintenance burden. It also creates a standardized import/export format for app state—the delta log, so you get a backup format for free.</p>
<p>I'm only designing around single-user apps at the moment. Having a "last-wins" policy for conflicts makes things nice and simple..</p>
<p>If anyone knows of related work I should check out, has suggestions, wants to collaborate, ... let me know. The code is still a bit messy, but I'm planning to tidy that up and open the repo soon.</p>

<p>Shower thought on yesterday's thread above: the painter's algorithm is a way to make an interface less stateful. It lets you specify shapes to draw in any order. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>It does this by adding  <em>more</em>  state to the implementation. You can't just draw each shape as you encounter it in the code. You have to shove them all into an array, sort by z value, and then draw them all.</li>
<li>It does this by adding more state to the communication channel. The human has to provide a z value now for each shape. Sometimes this is naturally obtained, sometimes it is not and the human now has to think in their heads about what z value to give their shapes to make the drawing come out as they want.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thinking about this, it feels like state is to some extent inevitable. There's some conservation of state going on. You can't really eliminate it. You squeeze it down in one area and like a balloon it pops up somewhere else.</p>

<p>I've been kinda obsessed with this paper, "Weird Machines, Exploitability, and Provable Unexploitability" since October last year.</p>
<p>🎥 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ynkWcfiwOk">RuhrSec 2018: "Keynote: Weird machines, exploitability and unexploitability", Thomas Dullien</a></p>
<p>(I think starting with the talk is a good idea)</p>
<p>After hearing about robust first computing I've been pondering the connection for a bit. I'm not really sure what to make of it, but there has to be some connection. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmlm6mtnSZs">this talk</a> by Dave Ackley he specifically mentions that "flipping one bit" (paraphrasing) can be enough to destroy a lot of software, which is the exact attack model that Dullien uses. It would be nice if software could maintain security invariants despite memory corruption (which Dullien proves for a small piece of software that he writes) so in that sense the two concepts allign. But I find that "continuing despite an error" or "return a best-effort answer" is the source of many security vulnerabilities, (mid example: database lookup fails, code is written in a way that forgot to handle that case, code continues anyway and returns admin data that shouldn't be shown). I wonder if any of y'all have read this or have thoughts about it. :))</p>

<p>I find a lot of statements these days describes a fact about something and then call it the “best”.</p>
<p>It’s like someone saying “look number 2 is so great, it’s the only even prime number, it’s so cool that it’s used as the base of digital systems, so we should use 2"</p>
<p>And someone else says: “well, number 3 is cool because it’s the first Mersenne prime, and it has a super cool divisibility rule, so we should use 3”.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, if the question is 1+1, then 2 is infinitly better than 3, and the other way around if the question is 4-1. And if you just need some positive integer as a placehold or something, then well, they are the same.</p>
<p>People seems to like and re-post these information a lot. I think these facts do provide some values, like the whole entertainment industry, it fulfills the curiosity of our minds and keeps us, well, entertained.</p>
<p>But drawing the conclusion that something is better, or something should be used instead of another thing based on these facts just feels off to me. It’s especially bad IMO, when people use these statements in PR reviews.</p>

<p>I have a question I hope someone here can answer. I am at something of a crossroads in my career and privileged enough to be able to pursue almost anything. When I tell people the big problems I'd like to make an impact on, it's education, specifically science education. I want more people to understand how the scientific method works and how we use it to gain more understanding.</p>
<p>I have passively read about education (Montessori, Bruner, Piaget, Pappert), followed Alan Kay and the smalltalk story, and I was a math teacher for a couple of years. I also teach currently online.</p>
<p>I can't help but think that there is more to using computers than reproducing old media, and that the code-debug cycle is a good way to refine our understanding. And so maybe there is something there, using programming and interactivity as a medium for exploration of ideas.</p>
<p>However, I don't have much more of a vision than that. I was talking to my wife about it yesterday and came up with an interesting phrasing: I want to do what Montessori did with her learning materials but with computers as a medium. </p>
<p>I would appreciate any and all links to people, conferences, reading material, etc., that are related to this idea.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, I don't mean teaching kids to code. And I don't mean using software to support the current educational paradigm (e.g., Chromebooks in schools, etc.). People seem to automatically roll back to those two pits.</p>
<p>I'm in pursuit of the next part of my career. I don't know what it will look like, but I want it to be productive.</p>

<p>pond’ring aloud:</p>
<p>I wonder if the problem with VPLs is the word “language”.</p>
<p>It appears to me that the word “programming” has been generally accepted to mean “sequential language” or writing sequential codes (aka “coding”). I view this view as being too restrictive. Programming is more than just commanding a machine with sequentialistic instructions. Programming a  <em>CPU</em> , though, is - by definition - sequentialistic. But,,, programming a  <em>machine(s)</em>  need not be sequentialistic. Especially in the age of nothing-is-central. In fact, LLMs are an example of non-sequentialism. The machines that run LLMs were programmed, arduously, in sequential notation, but, the inner success of LLMs is not sequential, but something else (massively parallel plinko?).</p>
<p>VPLs and DPLs are, to me, not sequentialistic things. Maybe they should be called “notations” instead of “languages”? VNP and DNP? Visual Notation for Programming, Diagrammatic Notation for Programming? [In which case, “programming languages” as we know them, are TNPs - Textual Notations for Programming].</p>
<p>In fact, programming is not the difficult part. Re-programming is the novel aspect of Design that computers bring to the world. We have been programming machines to do  <em>single</em>  things for centuries (using metal lathes, etc.). This time through, though, we have built machines capable of doing  <em>many</em>  things.</p>

<p>Related to my last post, where I believe we shouldn’t make decisions outside the context of a problem or goal.</p>
<p>I’ve observed the same issue with secondary goals, where they are discussed outside the context of primary goals.</p>
<p>I don’t know if this bothers other people, but it bothers me a lot. Maybe I’m not smart enough to see the implied connections.</p>
<p>One example I can give is that many times I’ve been given the goal of “consistency,” whether in the UI or the code style. I’m not saying “consistency” is a bad thing, but without connecting it to the primary pre-shared goal, the value of this secondary goal becomes trivial and nullified. Logically, it doesn’t make sense either, especially for a start-up, because a start-up is doing something new, and you can’t do new things by pursuing consistency. If we did things consistently, we’d still be using XML instead of JSON.</p>
<p>Again, to be clear, I’m not saying doing things consistently is bad. I’m just saying that, for me, when given the goal of “consistency” without the context of why it’s important for our primary goal, I’d be much more motivated.</p>
<p>Another example is “patterns.” I think initially “patterns” are just solutions to some pre-existing problems, but we put too much emphasis on them to the point where we forget about the goals of these patterns, and the patterns themselves become the goal. To be clear, I’m not saying patterns are bad or that we shouldn’t use them. We should know them, in the same way we should know other just-in-case knowledge, to perform better. Some patterns are just cool, and we derive joy from them, the same way we get joy from movies and music. I’m just saying we probably shouldn’t treat them as primary goals (unless in school, I guess, where you get points for implementing a pattern).</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, this may just be a communication issue within an organization, where secondary goals are communicated without the connection to primary goals. I’ve never worked in a big organization, and I wonder how they do it. Also, am I alone in this? Do other people feel demoralized too when given just a secondary goal?</p>

<p>Experiment: AI assisted summary edited by me to pique your interest (let me know what you think):</p>
<ul>
<li>Modern applications are siloed and have difficulty cooperating with each other.</li>
<li>This was not always the case, exemplified by the Apple Newton, a mobile device released nearly 30 years ago.</li>
<li>Apps on the Newton were written in NewtonScript, a prototype-based language.</li>
<li>Newton applications had a flexible top-level view, enabling app compositionality where entire apps could be nested within others.</li>
<li>Objects in NewtonScript (called frames) inherited properties from both their prototype and their parent, facilitating UI use.</li>
<li>This inheritance allowed an app to function as a widget inside another app, enabling dynamic interaction between nested and enclosing apps.</li>
<li>Apps on the Newton persisted their data in object stores called soups, which were accessible by multiple apps.</li>
<li>The concept of co-designing language and UI existed earlier, exemplified by the Boxer system from the 1980s.</li>
<li>Another example of compositionality is Morphic, a graphics system developed in Self and later adapted for Squeak and Lively Kernel, focusing on graphical structure rather than application logic.</li>
<li>Inspired by Morphic, the idea of an app store with composable apps was proposed about twenty years ago.</li>
<li>These apps would live-update, synchronize automatically, and be local-first, a concept predating Apple's app store.</li>
<li>Newspeak language derived partly from this effort.</li>
<li>A practical example of app composition is in travel, where a button for weather lookup could be embedded into an itinerary and dynamically interact with surrounding widgets to display relevant weather information.</li>

<p>I replied to this point mentioning my unshakeable belief in what I am doing, and it occurred to me that there aren't actually many on this FoC Slack who can equally say that they know  <em>exactly</em>  what they are certain is right for the Future of (Programming)! We get a lot of speculative and experimental thoughts here which is the reason we all engage, but who amongst you can say you are 110% certain you've found what you believe to be the Future, with the uncertainty  <em>only</em>  being in "whenever that comes about"? Which  of course, as the Twitter thread mentions, is about the seemingly trivial but of course 110% important factor of "memeing" to the Internet. Personally, I'm crap at that bit.</p>

<p>I posted a longer version of this above, but I don't think I introduced it very well! It's a stab at Stop Drawing Dead Fish in VR with spreadsheets and something called Geometric Algebra (GA) also known as Clifford Algebra.</p>
<p>Those who have scrutinized Stop Drawing Dead Fish(SDDF) closely might have noticed two references to GA. Bret also used to have a "Geometric Algebra" sticker on his laptop! But while GA is a very Bret thing, he actually did not  <em>use</em>  it to make SDDF, so my thing is trying to make good on that.</p>
<p>GA is a mathematical system where you get a bunch of geometric objects and transformations, and they all get related to one another by math that is quite a lot simpler than usual. For example, in the conventional/non-GA approach, if you wanted a line in 3D space you'd take two "vectors" v1 and v2 and say the line is the set of vectors v1+t*v2 for all scalars t. This can be kinda useful, but gets complicated if you ask for a simple thing like a rotation around that line. In the GA way of doing things, instead of being "a set of vectors", a line is its own sort of object - lines can be added together; multiplied by planes and rotations; etc. Lots of useful operations turn out to be examples of this, I've attached a pdf of examples.</p>
<p>"doing math/programming by working directly with (tangible/visualizable) geometric objects instead of with linear equations" should strike you as a centrally Bret thing. But why didn't he use it? I'll say in a comment under this message.</p>

<p>In my demo, I made the statement "... t2t doesn't need the full power of OhmJS ...", but, I didn't clarify.</p>
<p>For t2t - text to text transpilation - primarily, you need to pattern-match incoming text, then emit text based on the input.</p>
<p>OhmJS parses incoming text, then gives you the full power of JavaScript to do anything you want with the parse tree.</p>
<p>For t2t, you don't need to resort to class hierarchies, functions, closures, etc., etc. You primarily need to pattern match, then, create and modify text. In addition to OhmJS' ability to pattern-match, Javascript's "template strings" are about all you need - the ability to create text and to interpolate text from the tree walk of the parsed input.</p>
<p>This  <em>seems</em>  to be unnecessarily restrictive, but, turns out to be quite powerful and mind-freeing. Fewer options -&gt; less clutter -&gt; increased ability to think about interesting issues. After all, "simplicity" == "lack of nuance", and, my goal is to simplify DX.</p>
<p>[Infrequently, one needs to do a tiny bit more (like gensym() a new symbol and leave it on a scoped stack for use during the tree-walk), so I provide a way to break out and call a Javascript function, but, this kind of power is not needed in most cases. I guess that, in the future, I will restrict this some more, but, I'm still experimenting].</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/LayMwCIQAnM">In this video</a> you can see the progress I made on opening up codeflowcanvas so that it is embeddable in other frameworks/libraries like Astro/Angular and React. I've restructured some of the packages that the project uses and published these to NPM. You can see the embedding of codeflowcanvas on its own website using a custom StorageProvider for loading json files from a javascript bundle: <a href="https://www.codeflowcanvas.io/devlog/embedded-codeflowcanvas/">codeflowcanvas.io/devlog/embedded-codeflowcanvas</a> .</p>
<p>This goal of this restructuring is to get codeflowcanvas out of its own silo on various way (for example in the future I want to be able to design flows in a vscode editor and use these together with other framework/libraries without embedding the editor and just run the flows).</p>
<p>A feature that is also made possible by the above is being able to export to external formats like tldraw and the OpenCanvas work-in-progress spec (see <a href="https://www.canvasprotocol.org/">canvasprotocol.org</a>). Different strategies can be implemented to provide different formats.</p>

<p>Here’s an article I wrote on a visual dataflow language modality where the execution of the graphical dataflow dynamically constructs the dataflow graph that is itself executing. (It’s similar to how Elixer functions can output AST for the function instead of the result and one can alternate between AST via quote/unquote)</p>

<p>A new object was added to Automat over the last week - it's the final one that is needed for the MVP to work. And it does work! I've recorded myself writing a small C++ program and the macro recorder replayed it correctly ^^</p>
<p>I guess I'll start posting Automat updates to Mastodon :) Here is the first one - a new Macro Recorder object was added this week!</p>

<p>If you're anything like me (oof, sorry), you've heard of <a href="https://worrydream.com/refs/Smith_DC_1975_-_Pygmalion.pdf">Pygmalion</a> but never caught more than the gist. Some sort of project from the early 70s, similar to Sketchpad or Smalltalk or something, yet another promising prototype from the early history of our field that failed to take the world by storm. Our stock-in-trade on this show.</p>
<p>But you've probably heard of Programming by Demonstration. And you've certainly heard of  <em>icons</em>  — you know, those little pictures that have become indelibly part of computing as we know it. Pygmalion is the originator of these concepts… and more!</p>
<p>The best introduction to Pygmalion is <a href="https://twitter.com/warianoguerra">Mariano Guerra</a>'s <a href="https://instadeq.com/blog/posts/no-code-history-pygmalion-1975/">No-code History: Pygmalion</a>, which includes a clearly articulated summary of the big ideas, motivation, and design, with a video demonstration of the programming interface, key terminology, and links.</p>
<p>The  <em>most</em>  introduction to Pygmalion — or Pig Million, The Millionth Pig, as it'll surely come to be known — is the subject of today's episode: the original paper by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Canfield_Smith">David Canfield Smith</a>.</p>

<p>I've just learned about Alternate Reality Kit. I've searched through the archive and it was mentioned in passing a couple of times but I don't think this article was ever posted: <a href="https://worrydream.com/refs/Smith_R_1987_-_Experiences_With_The_Alternate_Reality_Kit,_An_Example_of_the_Tension_Between_Literalism_and_Magic.pdf">Experiences With The Alternate Reality Kit
An Example of the Tension Between Literalism and Magic</a> . There is also a relatively recent video upload (video comes from 87 but it was uploaded only three years ago) which shows a more mature version in action: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1HhPE0zV6g">The Alternate Reality Kit</a> .</p>
<p>Its similarity to the system that I'm developing is just uncanny! I'm very interested in learning more about it. I tried to follow its history to figure out why it was abandoned but I've only been able to track that its development eventually led to the Self language (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ka4KY7TMTU">Self and Self: Whys and Wherefores</a>) which honestly seems like a step back from the original. I have my theories about why it might have been abandoned (which is that educational software is hard to sell) but would love to learn more about it from the people who might know more. Or maybe there are other systems that might have been derived from it?</p>

<p>I don't know, but I have my hypothesis as well as for why this and other user-empowering approaches were abandoned: the rise of PCs. In the late 80s and early 90s, the first PCs appeared and were seen as the obvious road to computing for everyone. But they were not powerful enough to run environments like Smalltalk. It's Basic we got instead. In parallel, professional high-end computing grew as well and that's where the money was. Academia followed the money.</p>

<p><strong>@Joel Jakubovic</strong>’s thesis should be interesting to folks here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Achieving Self-Sustainability in Interactive Graphical Programming Systems</em> 
Programming is fraught with accidental complexity. Software, including tools used for programming, is inflexible and hard to adapt to one's specific problem context. Programming tools do not support Notational Freedom, so programmers must waste cognitive effort expressing ideas in suboptimal notations. They must also work around problems caused by a reliance on plain text representations instead of Explicit Structure.</p>
<p>The idea of a Self-Sustainable programming system, open to adaptation by its users, promises a way out of these accidental complexities. However, the principles underlying such a property are poorly documented, as are methods for practically achieving it in harmony with Notational Freedom and Explicit Structure. We trace the causes of this difficulty and use them to inform our construction of a prototype self-sustainable system. By carefully reflecting on the steps involved in our specific case, we provide insight into how self-sustainability can be achieved in general, and thus how a motivated programmer can escape the aforementioned sources of accidental complexity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This new website gives access to 50+ years of work by Alexander and colleagues at CES. The goal of this continuing endeavor is to share the work with all who wish to build and repair living environments in which people thrive.
In total, the Archive includes some 29,000 items. About 50% of them have been catalogued to date and are listed on the website. Around 6000 items have been digitized and are now available from the website as downloads. As funding allows, we will work toward making the whole collection available.</p>

<li>visual pl for creating your own compiler</li>
<li>visual pl for spreadsheet creation and customization </li>
<li>visual pl for making domain specific languages </li>

<p>I will probably converge on a visual programming language with a spreadsheet GUI that compiles to WebAssembly. Any resources for intuition about compilers, spreadsheets, or DSLs that help me understand these topics would much appreciate.</p>

<p>It is possible to break a computer's software in such a way that it requires outside intervention (e.g. a rescue disk) to fix.</p>

<p>If the problem you're chasing doesn't quite fit in any of these buckets, please share it in a similar format. (One sentence, not describing a solution.) If it does fit one or more of these buckets, please mention them. (Alternative wordings are also appreciated, but for me the primary goal here is to cluster ourselves.)</p>

<p>we keep telling computers how to work instead of what they should do</p>

<p>Oh, and they even added Bret Victor style variable "scrubbing".</p>
<p>(Desktop also got builtin Math Notes, minus handwriting, briefly flashed 51:57 — looks very much like <a href="http://Calca.io">Calca.io</a> / Soulver / NoteCalc etc.?)</p>
<p>So, are we "Magic Ink" yet?  (I'm not so much thinking of Bret Victor's essay as Ink&amp;Switch's experiments like <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/inkbase/">inkandswitch.com/inkbase</a>, CrossCut &amp; Untangle ...)</p>
<p>On one hand nothing revolutionary, spreadsheets had much more power for decades.</p>
<p>And yet a solid chunk of useful functionality is starting to move into taken-for-granted "this is just how futuristic paper  <em>naturally</em>  works" territory 👏.</p>
<p>I expect long term it might make such "what-if" explorations accessible¹ to more people, and more importantly prepare people for more complex interactions on top?</p>
<p>¹ well, once/IF it waters down to lower-end hardware.  Good-enough stylus tech remains expensive enough to be niche,  <em>not</em>  evenly distributed 😞</p>

<p>I always thought field was well ahead of its time. Prefigured a lot of Bret Victor's demos and future of coding work that followed in 'real world' use.. Happy to see it is still active. Has anyone used it?</p>

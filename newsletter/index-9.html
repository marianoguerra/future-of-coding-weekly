<p>I posted a longer version of this above, but I don't think I introduced it very well! It's a stab at Stop Drawing Dead Fish in VR with spreadsheets and something called Geometric Algebra (GA) also known as Clifford Algebra.</p>
<p>Those who have scrutinized Stop Drawing Dead Fish(SDDF) closely might have noticed two references to GA. Bret also used to have a "Geometric Algebra" sticker on his laptop! But while GA is a very Bret thing, he actually did not  <em>use</em>  it to make SDDF, so my thing is trying to make good on that.</p>
<p>GA is a mathematical system where you get a bunch of geometric objects and transformations, and they all get related to one another by math that is quite a lot simpler than usual. For example, in the conventional/non-GA approach, if you wanted a line in 3D space you'd take two "vectors" v1 and v2 and say the line is the set of vectors v1+t*v2 for all scalars t. This can be kinda useful, but gets complicated if you ask for a simple thing like a rotation around that line. In the GA way of doing things, instead of being "a set of vectors", a line is its own sort of object - lines can be added together; multiplied by planes and rotations; etc. Lots of useful operations turn out to be examples of this, I've attached a pdf of examples.</p>
<p>"doing math/programming by working directly with (tangible/visualizable) geometric objects instead of with linear equations" should strike you as a centrally Bret thing. But why didn't he use it? I'll say in a comment under this message.</p>

<p>Exploring Techniques and Notations for Augmenting DX</p>

<p>In my demo, I made the statement "... t2t doesn't need the full power of OhmJS ...", but, I didn't clarify.</p>
<p>For t2t - text to text transpilation - primarily, you need to pattern-match incoming text, then emit text based on the input.</p>
<p>OhmJS parses incoming text, then gives you the full power of JavaScript to do anything you want with the parse tree.</p>
<p>For t2t, you don't need to resort to class hierarchies, functions, closures, etc., etc. You primarily need to pattern match, then, create and modify text. In addition to OhmJS' ability to pattern-match, Javascript's "template strings" are about all you need - the ability to create text and to interpolate text from the tree walk of the parsed input.</p>
<p>This  <em>seems</em>  to be unnecessarily restrictive, but, turns out to be quite powerful and mind-freeing. Fewer options -&gt; less clutter -&gt; increased ability to think about interesting issues. After all, "simplicity" == "lack of nuance", and, my goal is to simplify DX.</p>
<p>[Infrequently, one needs to do a tiny bit more (like gensym() a new symbol and leave it on a scoped stack for use during the tree-walk), so I provide a way to break out and call a Javascript function, but, this kind of power is not needed in most cases. I guess that, in the future, I will restrict this some more, but, I'm still experimenting].</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/LayMwCIQAnM">In this video</a> you can see the progress I made on opening up codeflowcanvas so that it is embeddable in other frameworks/libraries like Astro/Angular and React. I've restructured some of the packages that the project uses and published these to NPM. You can see the embedding of codeflowcanvas on its own website using a custom StorageProvider for loading json files from a javascript bundle: <a href="https://www.codeflowcanvas.io/devlog/embedded-codeflowcanvas/">codeflowcanvas.io/devlog/embedded-codeflowcanvas</a> .</p>
<p>This goal of this restructuring is to get codeflowcanvas out of its own silo on various way (for example in the future I want to be able to design flows in a vscode editor and use these together with other framework/libraries without embedding the editor and just run the flows).</p>
<p>A feature that is also made possible by the above is being able to export to external formats like tldraw and the OpenCanvas work-in-progress spec (see <a href="https://www.canvasprotocol.org/">canvasprotocol.org</a>). Different strategies can be implemented to provide different formats.</p>

<p>I'm becoming interested in the idea of "programming tools as art", and as a consequence I'm interested in programming tools criticism.</p>
<p>I'd like to read/watch/hear critical reviews of programming tools that approach them not as bundles of features and capabilities, but as authored works that reflect a creative intent and as cultural touchstones and as environments or artifacts within which one can have deeply personal experiences.</p>
<p>A. Do you share my interest?</p>
<p>B. Do you know any such critics?</p>

<p>Who'd be interested in an event with talks and some performances around making notations and programming languages for pattern-making (textile, musical, choreographic etc)? Half focussed online, half focussed in-person, all streamed. Mix of open call and invited talks. All free/open access. Probably in January. Maybe called "Programming Of The Art Computer".</p>

<p>51:21 suppressing the present to see different ways to address the future</p>
<p>51:35 “semaphore” is a “bad idea”, pseudo-time is superior, but never got used over last 30 years</p>
<p>54:10 Nile Graphics Language by Dan Amelang is a dataflow language and is very small. Expresses how to define shapes using pixels in only 45 lines of code.</p>
<p>54:51 - Bret Victor at VPRI</p>
<p>57:59 all compositing rules, including alpha-blending, is expressed in 95 LOC</p>
<p>59:16 whole graphics system, equivalent to what is needed on a PC, is expressed in 435 LOC</p>
<p>1:01:00 - Code has to be transformed into CPU-speak</p>
<p>1:01:38 - we need a “language transforming language” [[pt] At present, I use the term “t2t” (text to text)]</p>
<p>1:01:58 - OMeta2 [[pt] OhmJS is an ancestor of OMeta2]</p>
<p>1:02:58 Using OMeta to make Nile, parser 130 LOC, LLL 730 LOC</p>
<p>1:06:00 TCP/IP expressed in 160 LOC</p>
<p>1:20:24 POLs == Problem Oriented Languages [[pt] I use the term SCN - Solution Centric Notation]</p>
<p>1:37:37 hardware is just software that is crystallized early [[pt] I say it another way: software is just soft hardware]</p>

<p>Here’s an article I wrote on a visual dataflow language modality where the execution of the graphical dataflow dynamically constructs the dataflow graph that is itself executing. (It’s similar to how Elixer functions can output AST for the function instead of the result and one can alternate between AST via quote/unquote)</p>

<p>If you're anything like me (oof, sorry), you've heard of <a href="https://worrydream.com/refs/Smith_DC_1975_-_Pygmalion.pdf">Pygmalion</a> but never caught more than the gist. Some sort of project from the early 70s, similar to Sketchpad or Smalltalk or something, yet another promising prototype from the early history of our field that failed to take the world by storm. Our stock-in-trade on this show.</p>
<p>But you've probably heard of Programming by Demonstration. And you've certainly heard of  <em>icons</em>  — you know, those little pictures that have become indelibly part of computing as we know it. Pygmalion is the originator of these concepts… and more!</p>
<p>The best introduction to Pygmalion is <a href="https://twitter.com/warianoguerra">Mariano Guerra</a>'s <a href="https://instadeq.com/blog/posts/no-code-history-pygmalion-1975/">No-code History: Pygmalion</a>, which includes a clearly articulated summary of the big ideas, motivation, and design, with a video demonstration of the programming interface, key terminology, and links.</p>
<p>The  <em>most</em>  introduction to Pygmalion — or Pig Million, The Millionth Pig, as it'll surely come to be known — is the subject of today's episode: the original paper by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Canfield_Smith">David Canfield Smith</a>.</p>

<p>I've just learned about Alternate Reality Kit. I've searched through the archive and it was mentioned in passing a couple of times but I don't think this article was ever posted: <a href="https://worrydream.com/refs/Smith_R_1987_-_Experiences_With_The_Alternate_Reality_Kit,_An_Example_of_the_Tension_Between_Literalism_and_Magic.pdf">Experiences With The Alternate Reality Kit
An Example of the Tension Between Literalism and Magic</a> . There is also a relatively recent video upload (video comes from 87 but it was uploaded only three years ago) which shows a more mature version in action: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1HhPE0zV6g">The Alternate Reality Kit</a> .</p>
<p>Its similarity to the system that I'm developing is just uncanny! I'm very interested in learning more about it. I tried to follow its history to figure out why it was abandoned but I've only been able to track that its development eventually led to the Self language (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ka4KY7TMTU">Self and Self: Whys and Wherefores</a>) which honestly seems like a step back from the original. I have my theories about why it might have been abandoned (which is that educational software is hard to sell) but would love to learn more about it from the people who might know more. Or maybe there are other systems that might have been derived from it?</p>

<p>I don't know, but I have my hypothesis as well as for why this and other user-empowering approaches were abandoned: the rise of PCs. In the late 80s and early 90s, the first PCs appeared and were seen as the obvious road to computing for everyone. But they were not powerful enough to run environments like Smalltalk. It's Basic we got instead. In parallel, professional high-end computing grew as well and that's where the money was. Academia followed the money.</p>

<p><strong>@Joel Jakubovic</strong>’s thesis should be interesting to folks here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Achieving Self-Sustainability in Interactive Graphical Programming Systems</em> 
Programming is fraught with accidental complexity. Software, including tools used for programming, is inflexible and hard to adapt to one's specific problem context. Programming tools do not support Notational Freedom, so programmers must waste cognitive effort expressing ideas in suboptimal notations. They must also work around problems caused by a reliance on plain text representations instead of Explicit Structure.</p>
<p>The idea of a Self-Sustainable programming system, open to adaptation by its users, promises a way out of these accidental complexities. However, the principles underlying such a property are poorly documented, as are methods for practically achieving it in harmony with Notational Freedom and Explicit Structure. We trace the causes of this difficulty and use them to inform our construction of a prototype self-sustainable system. By carefully reflecting on the steps involved in our specific case, we provide insight into how self-sustainability can be achieved in general, and thus how a motivated programmer can escape the aforementioned sources of accidental complexity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This new website gives access to 50+ years of work by Alexander and colleagues at CES. The goal of this continuing endeavor is to share the work with all who wish to build and repair living environments in which people thrive.
In total, the Archive includes some 29,000 items. About 50% of them have been catalogued to date and are listed on the website. Around 6000 items have been digitized and are now available from the website as downloads. As funding allows, we will work toward making the whole collection available.</p>

<ul>
<li>visual pl for creating your own compiler</li>
<li>visual pl for spreadsheet creation and customization </li>
<li>visual pl for making domain specific languages </li>

<p>I will probably converge on a visual programming language with a spreadsheet GUI that compiles to WebAssembly. Any resources for intuition about compilers, spreadsheets, or DSLs that help me understand these topics would much appreciate.</p>

<p>Oh, and they even added Bret Victor style variable "scrubbing".</p>
<p>(Desktop also got builtin Math Notes, minus handwriting, briefly flashed 51:57 — looks very much like <a href="http://Calca.io">Calca.io</a> / Soulver / NoteCalc etc.?)</p>

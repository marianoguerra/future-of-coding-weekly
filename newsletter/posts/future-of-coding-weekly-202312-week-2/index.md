This week I'd like to show how a new union type is added to miqula. See description under video. (no audio)

I really liked [Posy's latest video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSS6yAMZF78) so I just put a version of the motion extractor on replicate: [replicate.com/chigozienri/posy-motion-extraction](https://replicate.com/chigozienri/posy-motion-extraction)

Writing a bit about moving the state of the art—this piece itself isn’t doing it, but I kind of hope this framing is useful for people who  _are_  trying to do it. 

>For 75 years, programming languages have steadily raised the baseline of what “normal” programmers can express in their languages. They can still.

This bug I foisted on myself today was a real "things are not as they appear" puzzle.

So Mu was on the advent of Qemu calendar yesterday, and I totally missed it.

Status video about Kinopio2md (Kinopio to Markdown). What is not said is that the blue boxes are source code for the app (the compiler compiles the drawings to executable code).  I deal with a bunch of different programming languages, picking the best one for each step along the way (approximately 10, if you include English). I want to document more deeply the use of the Transpiler in, say, the “Escape Whitespace” Component (and others), but, I haven’t gotten around to it yet

I've been making a little program every evening with my new toy. Today:

Oh boy.. it was a lot of work being able to solve advent of code puzzle 7 (part 1) in my visual programming system.. as you can see in the video [youtu.be/kkgJQdJXFtk](https://youtu.be/kkgJQdJXFtk). I had to implement a lot new node-types for handling dictionaries and a new scoped-variable type. This scoped-variable can have different types.. currently just a regular value or a dictionary. This dictionary is used in a function-flow to determine the hand type which is needed in this puzzle. Also custom sorting was needed (I implemented a Schwartzian transform in the sort node-type). Running the flow for the full puzzle input takes a long time so I don't show that in the video (although I've added a "full-speed" mode that helps a bit). I've also added some colors to better show when some nodes are active, especially handy for nodes that run longer like a foreach, function-call, map or sort.

# Thinking Together

I believe that VPLs are better than TPLs.  I include some observations that led me to that conclusion.  meta: I choose to believe that this channel “thinking together” means that half-baked ideas are to be tossed out for brainstorming, pushback, discussion and revision.

This is absolutely fascinating. Tally marks are a little visual language that has coevolved with the textual context.



I don't have a link, but links appreciated.

What if web frameworks offered a standard way to discover capabilities that are then given to AI as tools? A  `document.getTools()`  perhaps?

This could be achieved simply with plugins for NextJS, VueJS, SvelteKit etc. Small convention that eliminates a lot of brittleness when web agents try to discover capabilities and invoke them.

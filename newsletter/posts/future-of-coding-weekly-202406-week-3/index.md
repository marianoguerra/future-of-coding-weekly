Things are moving again in the right direction 🙂 This week two new objects got finished - the Timeline and the Key Presser. Just one more and the MVP will be complete ^^

Hey folks, a video of the mathematical animation program I've been working on!

I am currently thinking about working on one or more of these ideas:




* visual pl for creating your own compiler
* visual pl for spreadsheet creation and customization 
* visual pl for making domain specific languages 

I will probably converge on a visual programming language with a spreadsheet GUI that compiles to WebAssembly. Any resources for intuition about compilers, spreadsheets, or DSLs that help me understand these topics would much appreciate.

 *Some possible goals for the future of software* 



After some [💬 #linking-together@2024-06-06](https://history.futureofcoding.org/?fromDate=2024-06-03&toDate=2024-06-09&channel=linking-together&filter=#2024-06-06T09:00:05.411Z) [discussions](https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1717926129937119), I spent some time searching the archives of this community for the word 'manifesto', then skimming the manifestos I found in search of their goals, phrased as  _problems_  they saw in the world. Then I clustered them by these problems. Here's what I ended up with, possible problems we have seen in the past:






* Programming computers requires a lot of knowledge and effort.


* [github.com/dkrasner/Simpletalk/blob/master/ComputingManifesto.pdf](https://github.com/dkrasner/Simpletalk/blob/master/ComputingManifesto.pdf)
* [github.com/stefanlesser/recurse/blob/master/manifesto2017.md](https://github.com/stefanlesser/recurse/blob/master/manifesto2017.md) (creating data visualizations)


* Adapting software to ourselves is hard; few people do it.


* [researchgate.net/publication/220427813_Meta-Design_A_manifesto_for_End-User_Development](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220427813_Meta-Design_A_manifesto_for_End-User_Development)
* [malleable.systems](https://malleable.systems)


* Software is trapped in silos (apps) and can't be recomposed.


* [malleable.systems](https://malleable.systems)
* [object.network/vw-llll.html](https://object.network/vw-llll.html)


* Software is inefficient and unstable because it's built atop a Jenga-like tower of dependencies.


* [handmade.network/manifesto](https://handmade.network/manifesto)
* [vladh.net/manifesto](https://vladh.net/manifesto)
* [guidoism.github.io/escape/day_two_manifesto](https://guidoism.github.io/escape/day_two_manifesto)


* Programmers encourage the world to be profligate with the attention of others.


* [github.com/stefanlesser/recurse/blob/master/manifesto2017.md](https://github.com/stefanlesser/recurse/blob/master/manifesto2017.md)


* Software has a deep influence on populations without corresponding accountability.


* [criticalengineering.org](https://criticalengineering.org)


* Programmers build software atop platforms optimized for consumption rather than creation.


* [inkandswitch.com](https://www.inkandswitch.com)


* Programmers can't build a sustainable living without behaving in anti-social ways hostile to their customers.


* [altocode.nl/blog/manifesto](https://altocode.nl/blog/manifesto)
* [github.com/stefanlesser/recurse/blob/master/manifesto2017.md](https://github.com/stefanlesser/recurse/blob/master/manifesto2017.md)


* Programming requires simulating the computer in your head.


* [shalabh.com/programmable-systems/wheres-my-simulator.html](https://shalabh.com/programmable-systems/wheres-my-simulator.html)


* UIs are poor.


* [github.com/Slackadays/Clipboard/wiki/User-Experience-Manifesto](https://github.com/Slackadays/Clipboard/wiki/User-Experience-Manifesto) (discoverability)
* [github.com/stefanlesser/recurse/blob/master/manifesto2017.md](https://github.com/stefanlesser/recurse/blob/master/manifesto2017.md) (touch-screen controls)


* It is possible to break a computer's software in such a way that it requires outside intervention (e.g. a rescue disk) to fix.


* [guidoism.github.io/escape/day_two_manifesto](https://guidoism.github.io/escape/day_two_manifesto)


* Computers can't model the world.


* [dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~hugh/TTM/DTATRM.pdf](https://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~hugh/TTM/DTATRM.pdf)



If the problem you're chasing doesn't quite fit in any of these buckets, please share it in a similar format. (One sentence, not describing a solution.) If it does fit one or more of these buckets, please mention them. (Alternative wordings are also appreciated, but for me the primary goal here is to cluster ourselves.)

we keep telling computers how to work instead of what they should do

🧮 [iPadOS "math notes" brings some spreadsheet/Calca mechanics to handwriting](https://www.youtube.com/live/RXeOiIDNNek?si=D0I3FnVdzoCgV8em&t=2790) via **Beni Cherniavsky-Paskin**

[🧵 conversation](https://history.futureofcoding.org/history/weekly/2024/06/W3/linking-together.html#2024-06-13T17:41:45.059Z)

Oh, and they even added Bret Victor style variable "scrubbing".



(Desktop also got builtin Math Notes, minus handwriting, briefly flashed 51:57 — looks very much like [Calca.io](http://Calca.io) / Soulver / NoteCalc etc.?)



So, are we "Magic Ink" yet?  (I'm not so much thinking of Bret Victor's essay as Ink&Switch's experiments like [inkandswitch.com/inkbase](https://www.inkandswitch.com/inkbase/), CrossCut & Untangle ...)

On one hand nothing revolutionary, spreadsheets had much more power for decades.

And yet a solid chunk of useful functionality is starting to move into taken-for-granted "this is just how futuristic paper  _naturally_  works" territory 👏.

I expect long term it might make such "what-if" explorations accessible¹ to more people, and more importantly prepare people for more complex interactions on top?



¹ well, once/IF it waters down to lower-end hardware.  Good-enough stylus tech remains expensive enough to be niche,  _not_  evenly distributed 😞

I always thought field was well ahead of its time. Prefigured a lot of Bret Victor's demos and future of coding work that followed in 'real world' use.. Happy to see it is still active. Has anyone used it?

anyone around here working in a R&D department ? I need some pointers. Thanks!

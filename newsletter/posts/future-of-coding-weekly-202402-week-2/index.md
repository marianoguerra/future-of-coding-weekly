I wrote this article which covers speech synthesis ML, with a focus on the most challenging + interesting problem in speech: prosody generation. 



Understanding this is key to building multi-modal input/output for LLMs

Smart labels are a visual indication that a value has detailed information and contextual actions accessible with a click



Plugins can register their own smart label types and detailed views and contextual actions for those types or types registered by other plugins

Not exactly a project, but I was thinking about the way I use [tldraw.com](http://tldraw.com) as an infinite  _single_  notepad - not starting new files, just gradually moving to a new part of the canvas as I need to. And as I was thinking I thought it'd be amusing to show off my canvas. This is about a year's worth of intermittent diagramming. I still use pen and paper a lot, and I don't yet know what the trigger is for me to get on tldraw instead of reaching for my notebook.

The future of coding may involve rendering histograms of random variables in Three.js, so here we are.

It's all smoke and mirrors, but seeing the charts fill up was part of the UX that I wanted to test first, and… oh yeah, that's what I was hoping for. 👌

Hi, [in this video](https://youtu.be/iFga2bfptBk) I show the progress on a new feature that I really wanted for quite some time: combining nodes into reusable compositions. This helps in making flows smaller. The compositions can be accessed from within the node-type selector so they can be added to the flow. One thing that I really like is how the inputs and outputs to compositions are created based on the connections which cross the bounds of the selected area. I've also finally added a way to copy & paste nodes which is a nice productivity improvement. 



In the video I demonstrate my other flow engine instance with which you can create fragment shaders in webgl and here I've recreated a shader form shadertoy made by kishimisu (see [shadertoy.com/view/mtyGWy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/mtyGWy) ). I had to extend the node-types to make this possible. Currently I cant yet create nested compositions but once that is possible I hope it will help decrease the "node-spaghetti" further. Because I do think that the textual shadertoy code is still easier to read then my visual version. Which obviously I want to improve. 



I am almost ready to send out a link to my visual editor but decided to work on it a little bit more for ar least this month. I want to extend and improve some features and create more example flows.

I wanted to make a pit stop at this tug-of-war example from [ProbMods](https://probmods.org/chapters/conditioning.html) before I moved on to working on the code editor because it's one of the most eye-opening in terms of what's possible in PPLs, and because  _this_  is the visual I wanted that I couldn't get in WebPPL, in two ways: 1) all the plots, arranged how I wanted them, and 2) always-on plots that let me see the samples as they come in, with the charts getting smoother and smoother the longer I'm willing to wait.

🗨️ Software Craftsmanship: The New Imperative via **Dave Liepmann**

[🧵 conversation](https://history.futureofcoding.org/history/weekly/2024/02/W2/reading-together.html#2024-02-08T19:52:43.937Z)

Pete McBreen's  _Software Craftsmanship: The New Imperative_  (2002).



Most of the book is about the consequences of distinguishing between "software engineering" (defined as armies of programmers going down a waterfall) and "software craftsmanship" (defined as small teams working incrementally). He runs deep with the craftsman metaphor, taking seriously how to make real the "apprentice" and "journeyman" stages in a software developer's career.



One interesting thread is that he points out how "best practices" are firmly a creation of the software engineering side of his binary, and do not satisfy craftspeople's very different trade-offs. Some by nature will wind around on their own path, custom-fitting each architectural decision to their preferences and the needs of the specific project.



There is overlap with our [💬 #thinking-together@2023-12-30](./?fromDate=2023-12-27&toDate=2024-01-02&channel=thinking-together&filter=#2023-12-30T13:04:55.921Z), exploring [Jack Rusher](https://twitter.com/jackrusher)'s ontology of [programming, computer science, software engineering]. It seems useful to me to further distinguish the "strong S.E." that Jack and McBreen use as definitional from the "soft S.E." which we all seem to use colloquially to mean all manner of techniques for making an application error-resistant. The work of the latter may not be intellectually engaging or novel but it lacks the qualities which make strong SE distasteful: centralization of power, treating developers interchangeably, the urge towards monoculture, a cultural belief in "training" instead of learning.

New visual programming languages don't fail as visual programming languages.



They fail as programming languages, which is what most new programming languages do.

Is there an attempt at making a more beginner-friendly, perhaps graphical, form of prolog. Perhaps something like Squeak, but where the computation model is more logic programming than imperative, structured programming?



Or perhaps some other friendly presentation of logic programming?

📢 [Levlo: looking for the first team member](https://levlo.com/) via **Jarno Montonen**

[🧵 conversation](https://history.futureofcoding.org/history/weekly/2024/02/W2/present-company.html#2024-02-06T07:58:17.256Z)

I'm  *looking for the first team member*  for a natural language programming startup I've been working on since the beginning of 2021: [levlo.com](https://levlo.com).

The responsibilities can be defined based on experience and interests to fit somewhere between passionate frontend developer + designer and full-stack developer + product owner/chief product officer.



I live in Espoo, Finland, but we'd work mostly full-remote. However, due to bureaucracy, residence in Finland is required. Atm I have funding for 12 months of 4200€/month salary (with working time and benefits as defined by Finnish law) and will be offering equity on top. The goal is certainly to find funding for paying the salary going forward as well.



Since releasing the demo shown on the site, I've been working on rewritting large parts of the underlaying technology to be able to add features required by potential use-cases that have come up. Now, after ~5 months, I've finally been able to start adding those language features and start work towards enabling real world use-cases. Sales effort hase been fairly minimal so far, but I have one confirmed pilot customer (B2B) and will be putting more effort into sales going forward.



The techstack is C#, Azure and Blazor (similar to Vue). The most important skills would be web frontend development (& design), cloud (Azure), and C#. In that order. The C# you'll need to write will be fairly trivial and it should be easy for anyone familiar with eg. Java or TypeScript to pick it up. But first and foremost I'm looking for someone passionate about the future of programming willing to embark on this hopefully decades long journey with me!

<p>Hey. I am working on the Ara project, a social network platform to build projects together. For a general information here is the landing page: <a href="https://ara.foundation/">ara.foundation</a></p>
<p>I did the research (<a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVN1CP7ck=/?share_link_id=508424426161">Here is the link</a>) and I am quite excited to meet some of the folks that I encountered there. Actually FoC helped me a lot during the research.</p>
<p>As for the sharing, I want to publish the whitepaper, but I need your feedback. Especially critical points if i have the flaws on my thesis.</p>
<p>Much appreciation <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LJ5JbHMg0y_GjJTWoISxVAqR9issBYlpyzuE1FqFHYw/edit?usp=sharing">your feedback</a></p>
<h2>Devlog Together</h2>
<h3>📝 A text editor that supports doodling by <a href="http://akkartik.name/about">Kartik Agaram</a>

<p>A text editor that supports doodling.</p>
<p>Some previous ways to have text coexist with a canvas:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://smallandnearlysilent.com/inknswitch/">A fixed background that is disconnected from text.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/112536829727198624">Fixed page boundaries.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here I'm instead attaching doodles to a  <em>pivot</em>  character that they move with in the presence of edits. When you start drawing you're presented with a set of pivot options, one grey square per character on screen. After you pick one, it turns pink and the other options disappear. Now you can start drawing.</p>
<p>Displacements to the pivot are preserved in font-derived units, so it looks "reasonable" as you resize the font.</p>
<p>Deleting a character deletes all drawings pivoted on it. (But there's undo.)</p>
<p>This took 200 lines, so not too much though it was more than I'd initially expected.</p>

<p>(Where's everyone else? I'm feeling lonely in this channel.)</p>
<p>I hadn't tried this until today, but it turns out to work: I can create equations forwards and back, and trigger either selectively based on what blanks I fill in.</p>
<p>The fine print: to switch directions I have to fill in the right blank, clear the old blank, and then type in something outside the old blank (to indicate I'm not going to type further into the old blank).</p>
<p>Works better if I clear the old query first, but who can remember that?</p>
<p>Perhaps I should just recompute on every mouse click. Then the third step could be clicking outside any blanks. More wasteful, because most of the time a mouse click won't require recomputation. It's Tadi, but is it permacomputing? 🦋</p>

<p>(I'll join in on the fun!)</p>
<p>I've been experimenting with using generative AI inside Github Actions lately and have been really intrigued by this async/event driven interaction model with code generation.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/sublayerapp/sublayer_actions">this repo</a> we have a Github Action that runs every morning and has Gemini, Claude, and GPT-4 generate a PR adding additional functionality. Then on PR merge a release message is sent to our discord with example use cases and each of them riff on what was merged and try to come up with additional related functionality.</p>
<p>I've already merged a few PRs and some of the ideas they've come up with are pretty interesting, especially the riffs - I merged a PR about querying a notion database, and Gemini came up with taking a row in a Notion database and creating an Asana task.</p>
<p>Some of the things they've come up with so far:</p>

<p>Merged a couple more exploring this async AI pattern in some new directions and starting to feel a bit like the sorcerer's apprentice with every PR I merge resulting in 3 new PRs 😆</p>

<p>Is there any research about 3d user interface? Right now we use the windows from Xerox popularized by Macbooks. But I am considering to make it as a game scene, where everything is represented as a 3d objects. I couldn't find anything related to this, or attempts before. The only close thing for this is the holograms from the sci-fi.</p>
<p>As a reference, I am making a social network, but I want it to be a 3d. As a reference here is the prototype:</p>

<p>I also recorded the new form of interface for the crypto wallets. How the transferring tokens from your address to another is done. If there are any systematic explanation of 3d objects, I would appreciate it. :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite the variety of creative approaches practiced by different scientists, one tried-and-true though often overlooked — trick for generating new ideas stands out. It may sound trivial, yet it is as reliable as it is simple: talk to someone. By talking with other people, we not only pool the information or ideas that each of us individually lacks, but we are also able to improvise new thoughts that are not accessible to us alone. In this episode, Itai Yanai and Martin Lercher talk through the ideas in two of their editorials (available at <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-02074-2">nature.com/articles/s41587-023-02074-2</a> and  <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-021-02575-w">genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-021-02575-w</a>).</p>

<p>This is a psychology paper, so perhaps not what you usually consume, but I want to encourage you to give this a go. I think it’s super useful to leave our bubble from time to time and learn about what other disciplines’ perspectives on computation are. I’ll quote the summary at the end, but there is so much more building up to that that you don’t want to miss, certainly not before commenting on it. :)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The view that intelligence equals some kind of computational optimization is no longer tenable. It does not help us make sense of a large world. Therefore, claims that the study of intelligence is converging onto computational rationality as its ultimate foundation are not only premature, but outright misguided. Quite the opposite: we have shown here that the basic foundation of natural agency and cognition, and therefore of anything we could reasonably call “intelligence,” cannot be computational at all because it cannot be completely formalized. The dream of generating purely algorithmic systems able to think and act like human beings is and remains a pipe dream, because purely symbolic machines exist in small worlds, in which there is no problem of relevance to be solved.</p>

Was quite complicated getting the audio working in a browser, there is a vid inside.

I've implemented a Lisp REPL/Shell for accessing my deployment infrastructure and other parts of my personal compute resources. It uses the same AST/interpreter as the rest of EYG.

Hi all, a project I’ve been helping out with is looking going to be looking for Test Flight users soon - more details here 🙂

I'm building an automatic brand (and theme) design tool. Any comments are welcome 🙂. Current plan is to add signup + payments + basic documentation / export functionality, and then launch it.

I have been trying to create a video demoing some of the work I have been doing for the past 3 years (on the side) and it’s turning out to be a lot harder than I expected … I do have phone anxiety but this isn’t a phone 😳 Anyhow, feedback welcomed. I will be re-recording it. I know it’s way too long and that I am yapping too much …

Hi! I recently noticed how I struggle regrouping things by topic/task/project on my different devices (laptop, phone). Quite frequently, one topic can be spread across 5+ apps/website. My less than ideal solution is to introduce another aggregator app (roam research in my case) and paste & tags different links when possible. Arc browser spaces also helps with that. The issue is that it's very manual and not worth for small ad hoc topic and researches.



Is this a problem you are facing? How do you solve/work-around it? Any interesting links on the topic?



I believe it could & should be solved at the OS level and found really interesting project: [playb.it](https://playb.it/), MercuryOS, [alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/000](https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/000/) but I feel like there should be more

Question for people who've read  _Tools for Conviviality_ 



Do you think "convivial" in the Illich sense has connotations of communality? Like, having a strong sense of membership in a coherent, shared community?



I'd never really thought of it that way, but I was just chatting with a friend who's only skimmed the essay, and had that impression. Obviously I think I'm right, but I also wonder if I've been reading my own bias towards independence and self-sufficiency into the essay. I'd appreciate thoughts. "The future is a disagreement with the past about what is important." And at this point it doesn't matter what Illich intended, only what we in the audience tend to make of his words.



If we tend to agree that conviviality is independent of social arrangements, and that it is equally applicable to gregarious people who like to be cheek by jowl with others and introverts who are more off on their own, this might suggest that the word "conviviality" isn't an ideal term in the year 2023 for a value a lot of us tend to aim towards here. It was a frontrunner in our long thread about renaming FoC ([linen.futureofcoding.org/t/42821/here-s-a-big-one-apologies-in-advance-to-everyone-for-the-un](https://linen.futureofcoding.org/t/42821/here-s-a-big-one-apologies-in-advance-to-everyone-for-the-un)) but perhaps it has some distracting connotations.

Hello FoC Community 🙂

I have something in mind which I don't know exactly how difficult it i or even possible so I'm going to ask for your council here. I have some files 2-4 GB and I want to share those with a friend. What would be the best way to do so? Assuming that I don't want to use dropbox or google drive.  I vaguely remember that there was a programm called wormwhole or somethign which did this using python. I would kike to have something in go which has nice cross OS binaries. This looks nice but I would want to have a simple exchange application wher eI can use it instead of a lib to be implemented. [github.com/filecoin-project/go-data-transfer/blob/master/benchmarks/testnet/peernet.go](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-data-transfer/blob/master/benchmarks/testnet/peernet.go) Another question - fundamental in nature- if I join a P2P net what do I need to exchange with my peer  - out of band such that we can exchange files through the P2P network. ie.e. how do we find each other? Thank you for your thoughts and ideas.

Branching out from the discussions about the current state of AI agents vs. how they were imagined in the text from the recent podcast episode...



I was glad to hear our hosts were on a similar thought-track when discussing the "send this draft to the rest of the group and let me know when they've read it" example regarding how programmers tend to parse the last bit as "let me know when the metrics indicate they scrolled to the end" (etc) whereas a human agent would parse it as "and follow up with them after a reasonable time to ask if they've read it or not."



One thing that struck me was the number of times I've told a white lie in that kind of scenario. Yes, I read it! (No, I haven't, but I just pulled it up when you asked and I'm skimming it now before the meeting starts).



Dishonesty with the metrics-mindset takes a different form. In simple forms, it's like terms of service pages which gate the "agree" button behind a scroll value... You scroll to the end to lie. But if the designers of those metrics were somehow able to perfect them (eye tracking? a quiz at the end?) then an AI agent could force a more accurate/truthful answer from you.



All that to get to my point... Do we have a right to lie about this stuff? How important is it for us to be able to present less-than-truthful representations to other people even if the medium is via an AI agent? If we don't include this concern in our designs, are we facilitating a world of micro-surveillance of coworkers and friends?

Faré gave a talk “Prototypes: Object-Orientation, Functionally” to our Toronto Lisp Group Sept. 5, 2023.



My personal agenda is finding the “atoms” of programming (simplicity, clarity).  I think that Faré nailed the questions of what is OO, what are Classes, what are Prototypes?

The slides from last night are [github.com/metareflection/poof/blob/main/poof-slides-2023.rkt](https://github.com/metareflection/poof/blob/main/poof-slides-2023.rkt) . With the caveat that the slides and talk are WIP.



30 LOC to implement Prototypes (and Classes) in any language that supports first class functions.

The C programming language was devised in the early 1970s as a system implementation language for the nascent Unix operating system. Derived from the typeless language BCPL, it evolved a type structure; created on a tiny machine as a tool to improve a meager programming environment, it has become one of the dominant languages of today. This paper studies its evolution.

Been a while since I've posted here, but I've been playing around with Domain Driven Design and drawing context maps: ended up building a little React app to help me draw them. It's not much, but I think the "auto-blobbing" is kind of a neat/cute interaction. There's actually a surprising amount of computational topology behind it!

Hopefully this isn't too ranty for this channel:


>I like to say that software is often just bureaucracy by other means (though it could be oh so much more).

This might be the single-most powerful example of that on the internet: <https://rclone.org/drive/#making-your-own-client-id>

The reason I sought this page out:
- I want to download a copy of my baby photos in case Google shuts me out in future.

- Google Takeout is basically unusable if you have more data than you can download in 30 minutes. (<https://lethallava.land/notes/9if8o9ngl13900d9>)

- So I saved my Takeout files to Google Drive (not yet taken out! <https://merveilles.town/@akkartik/110892364898712223>)

- Then I had to find a way to get files out of Google Drive. Which leads to the above page.

Google should be required to report reading burdens like the OMB does for US govt. forms.

Before coming back to working on Lamdu after a few months break, I had to first start making this game:



Took the opportunity to use modern tools like Svelte, GitHub Copilot and Stable Diffusion for the first time which makes for a good reference for what FoC will need to improve on 🙂

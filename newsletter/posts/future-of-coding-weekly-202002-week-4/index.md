On the experiment side, this week I started playing with emojis to allow quick scans for content of interest, I will try to be consistent with the emoji usage so people can use them to orient around a previously dry wall of text (the tool I use doesn't excel at promoting creative expression)

## Demos

> UIST 2016: Proceedings of the 29th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software & Technology
> 
> Aligning and distributing graphical objects is a common, but cumbersome task. In a preliminary study (six graphic designers, six non-designers), we identified three key problems with current tools: lack of persistence, unpredictability of results, and inability to 'tweak' the layout.
> 
> We created StickyLines, a tool that treats guidelines as first-class objects: Users can create precise, predictable and persistent interactive alignment and distribution relationships, and 'tweaked' positions can be maintained for subsequent interactions.

> CHI'17: ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems Session: Spatial & Temporal Design
> 
> Traditional graphic design tools emphasize the grid for structuring layout. Interviews with professional graphic designers revealed that they use surprisingly sophisticated structures that go beyond the grid, which we call graphical substrates.
> 
> We present a framework to describe how designers establish graphical substrates based on properties extracted from concepts, content and context, and use them to compose layouts in both space and time.

![🧵](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f9f5/32.png) A [twitter thread](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/927593460642615296.html) by [@gravislizard](https://twitter.com/gravislizard) argues that keyboard based old text UI was faster and not necessary less intuitive than web UI with mouse: > almost everything on computers is perceptually slower than it was in 1983 amber-screen library computer in 1998: type in two words and hit F3. search results appear instantly. now: type in two words, wait for an AJAX popup. get a throbber for five seconds. oops you pressed a key, your results are erased.

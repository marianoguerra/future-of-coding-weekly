<p>Been making good steady progress on my new editor. I now have my wasm extensions
automatically interrupt. So I can have a long running computation (or even an
infinite loop) happening in an extension, on the same thread and not miss any
frame times. Having that really sets the ground work for the live programming
model I want for these "extensions".</p>
<p>After some clean up I'm starting to do some dog fooding for another project I'm
working on, generating an arm64 assembler from the xml specification of
instructions. The plan is to write the coding utilizing my editor as the
visualization environment to get fast feedback on if I have the instructions
correct. Still a long way to go, but the fundamentals are taking shape.</p>

<p>Perhaps you too are wondering if software is inherently spatial. A great paper
on this topic is “Software is an Abstract Artifact” by Nurbay Irmak. I might not
agree with everything written, but it is a very readable paper and a great
introduction to the topic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Software is a ubiquitous artifact, yet not much has been done to understand
its ontological nature. There are a few accounts offered so far about the
nature of software. I argue that none of those accounts give a plausible
picture of the nature of software. I draw attention to the striking
similarities between software and musical works. These similarities motivate
to look more closely on the discussions regarding the nature of the musical
works. With the lessons drawn from the ontology of musical works I offer a
novel account of the nature of software. In this account, software is an
abstract artifact. I elaborate the conditions under which software comes into
existence; how it persists; how and on which entities its existence depends.</p>

<p>I’m curious “where” people think of visual in visual programming being. For
context, I spend a lot of time in tools like Houdini, Solidworks, Cavalry, and
After Effects. Some of them have more access to computation than others, but the
biggest difference between those and Processing or threejs is a large “standard
library” of functions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, building a website with live feedback or scripting in a REPL
seem like a very different experience from just writing the same code in
notepad. I wonder if visual programming is all just “debug views” rather than
the specific presence of a GUI. And if so, what does that mean for generalized
visual languages or environments?</p>

<p>I am not sure but this might be a <em>thing</em> - in order to reduce scrolling through
files I try to keep each function in respective separate file (so I have over
hundred of files so far) and I wrote a simple code that copies the content of
the function into the body of the html page and adds some template text like
<em>&lt;script&gt; tags etc.</em></p>
<p>I try to find the most minimal set of tools in the motto of <em>bicycle for mind</em> -
in other words - you don’t need a complex solution like an aircraft carrier but
rather a bicycle.</p>

<p>Does anyone have future of code flavored papers by folks who aren’t white dudes?</p>
<p>I’ve been pulling together a reading list for an engineering reading group at
work, and would like to make sure it’s at least a 50/50 split.</p>

<p>I'm in need of two solutions:</p>

<li>Generating a language model out of ANTLR grammar. Preferably in C#.</li>
<li>Printing an AST to text according to an ANTLR grammar.</li>

<p>Another thing I'd be interested is solutions for bidirectional text
transformations (for source code). Ideally a system in which you could define
transformations once, and get both AtoB and BtoA transformers</p>

<p>Hi folks — any fans of A Pattern Language here? Or (like me) any wannabe fans? I
dip into it, and it has been invaluable in designing multiplayer apps with
nuanced social interaction.
<a href="https://interconnected.org/home/2022/01/21/social_gradient">Here’s one of my blog posts.</a></p>
<p>However! It’s long and I’ve never read the whole thing… So a few of us on Masto
decided to start a reading group. One pattern a week, we’ll finish neatly at the
end of the book’s 50th anniversary year (2027)</p>
<p>We’re meeting on discord at 5pm uk time on mondays (so noon east coast us, 9am
west coast). Starting this coming Monday. Join us here:

be of interest to at least some people here!</p>

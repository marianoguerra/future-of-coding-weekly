Welcome! we are slightly over 150 members, let's try the 200 goal for next month :)  
  
This time I introduced some simple separators between entries so it's clear where something ends and the next thing starts, let me know what you think.

## Demos

**Edward de Jong** posted a new example showing the physical units of measurement feature in the Beads language, which tracks units at runtime (by storing the exponents of the component physical unit terms along with the value). A few languages have included physical units, but it is extremely rare to track the units at runtime.

For the heat transfer app, see [https://github.com/magicmouse/beads-examples](http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/marianoguerra/future-of-coding-weekly-2020-01-week-3/16109578-github.com/magicmouse/beads-examples?c=f8edef3a-2c5e-4af4-a34d-904e97c707cf), for the SDK go to [beadslang.com](http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/marianoguerra/future-of-coding-weekly-2020-01-week-3/16109582-beadslang.com/?c=f8edef3a-2c5e-4af4-a34d-904e97c707cf), for more information check [beadslang.org](http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/marianoguerra/future-of-coding-weekly-2020-01-week-3/16109586-beadslang.org/?c=f8edef3a-2c5e-4af4-a34d-904e97c707cf) (which is different from the previous one)

> Easier drag & drop of one or more items across long distances or across screens with the basket.
> 
> Workspaces can be created to work on different tasks and search used to navigate between them.

> Increasingly popular in the last couple of years, I think 2020 is going to be the year of “no code”: the movement that say you can write business logic and even entire applications without having the training of a software developer. I empathise with people doing this, and I think some of the “no code” tools are great. But I also thing it’s wrong at heart.

> Didn't realize that Bret had directory listings enabled on his server, but it makes sense given other "open for people to view and tinker" things he's done. (My favourite: all his javascript is unminified so you can see how he implemented the dynamic examples in his essays.)

Web apps, New effect types in code sandbox (HTTP, Async and Log) and Shallow effect handlers added to my language. 

# Devlog Together

The people using my software as a back-end for their web project are running machines that are not allowed to use docker, but are allowed to use "podman". Podman does not implement the feature of docker-compose.yml files that allows you to build an image from a github repository. So this week I need to learn how to publish docker images of my alpha software that nearly no one uses. Having users is the best/worst.

Hi everyone, I’ve been thinking about using hypertext instead of text files as the medium to represent programs  _and their executions_ .

Programs contain a lot of cross references that are resolved only after the parser/runtime have had a go. IDEs also redo this parsing work to simulate the same cross references for easy editing. The idea is to embed these references in the medium itself. So, get rid of import statements, file boundaries and such. Each textual reference - function name, type name, any identifier really - would be link to the object it references. Unlike strongly structured environments, this allows some flexibility in representing partial and possibly invalid structures. I’m interested in implementations you know of that match this idea.

Recently, I realised that despite “vaguely knowing” what [VPRI](http://www.vpri.org/) was doing (and trying to do), I never bothered to thoroughly read [their reports and papers](https://tinlizzie.org/IA/index.php/Papers_from_Viewpoints_Research_Institute). Now that I took the time to read them, I feel like overall it’s been time well spent (I got inspiration and encouragement for some projects).



I’d like to know if you know about the VPRI undertaking, and if you do, whether you read (some of) their papers/reports - see poll below. I’m also interested in similar experiences you had with other projects (thinking you know what they do, then having this understanding deepened by looking at their work more carefully).

[Everyone excited for Fortran 2023!?](https://wg5-fortran.org/N2201-N2250/N2212.pdf) Only mostly joking, but I just noticed today that fortran is scheduled for [a new standard release next month](https://wg5-fortran.org/f2023.html). I got a big smile at some of the proposed imporvements




* Trig functions that work in degrees
* Using integer arrays to specify subscripts and section subscripts
* Enum types

It looks like Figma is secretly – not so secretly 😛 – starting to turn code into design, and plugged in a mini-structured editor along the way.

(Attaching a couple of screenshots from the og file)

Got interested in the [conceit](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conceit#English:_rhetoric) of a fringe-conference called "Programming Languages and Operating Systems", then read the CfP which seems to be aiming to pre-stifle any thoughts you may have had that innovation outside the familiar borders would be acceptable:



Suggested paper topics include, but are not restricted to:




* domain-specific and type-safe languages for the OS;
* the design of language-specific unikernels;
* language-based approaches to crosscutting system concerns, such as security and run-time performance;
* PL support for system verification, testing, and debugging;
* synthesis of OS code;
* static/dynamic OS configuration and specialization;
* PL support for OS integration of modern hardware (NVM, HBM, FPGAs, accelerators, RDMA, etc.);
* the use of OS abstractions and techniques in language runtimes;
* verification and static analysis of OS components;
* critical evaluations of new programming language ideas in support of OS construction; and
* experience reports on applying new language techniques in commercial OS settings.

I found myself referring to this (2016) video.  In case all y’all (the plural form of “y’all”) haven’t seen it…

A paper worth reading that (among other topics) argues that end-user programming should better be called vernacular programming

 _#past-company_ 



When the industry switched over from mainframes and minicomputers to personal computers, how big a regression was the performance of a typical PC versus that of a mainframe / mini at the time? (Keeping this question vague because I'm not quite sure how to phrase it. Feel free to interpret it however you like.)

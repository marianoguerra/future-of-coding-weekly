<p>I just came up with a name for the versioning scheme I've been using recently:</p>

<p>1, 2, 3, ... 14, 14a, 14b, ... 14z, 14aa, ... 14ak1, 14ak2, ...</p>
<p>My versions are to communicate identity. That's it. Not ordering, not value, not recency, not stability, not compatibility, not quantity of change, not support duration, just identity. Am I using the same version as you?</p>
<p>(The easiest way to come up with versions also ends up communicating heredity. But that's an unimportant side effect.)</p>

<p>I’ve been digging into how we might interact with AI, beyond chatbots, and whether we could have NPCs as colleagues...</p>
<p>In particular I’ve been writing actual code (ulp) around actual multiplayer apps (ulp) to see what the interactions and issues might be</p>
<p>It is slightly ridiculous to imagine AI NPCs as dolphins... but why not, right? We’ve got a lot of language around “companion species” as a metaphor for AI, so let’s jump and see if that works.</p>
<p>So here’s a Twitter/X thread of my first sketches: multiplayer cursors that look like other users, but are actually NPCs</p>
<p>Big lessons: escaping the chatbot format might let us answer the AI affordance issue (ie how do we know what the AI can do). Here the NPC can proactively tell you. But also apps will need significant re-engineering to present a machine API and NPC runtime</p>
<p>Gonna dig in this direction for a couple weeks, so up for chatting with anyone about the intersection of AI/multiplayer/collaboration/etc</p>

<p>For some time I've thought that type systems are essentially ad-hoc logic languages. So.. why not use a full on logic language (prolog or something) to statically analyze your codebase instead of keep patching onto a type system, it appears to me that logic languages are simpler &amp; more expressive than most type systems. I'm starting to work on this for my language, and creating a logic language in efforts to also understand logic programming better.</p>
<p>Another advantage I can think of is that if a the logic language is expressive enough to type even the most advanced languages as well as the weakest, it could be used as a shared interface between languages to understand at least parts of each others type systems, as well as be a tool for user extension for additional static analysis specific to their project.</p>
<p>I'm basically thinking something like this.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="c1"># here's a sample program in my (object oriented) language</span>

<p>The specifics of my logic language is likely flawed, but I'm curious about the general idea of using a fully-fledged logic language to generate a program in &amp; run instead of generated a typed AST and running ad-hoc type systems.</p>
<p>My question is, what are people's thoughts on this? Any previous work in this area? Any obvious flaws?</p>

<p>I might be missing context here but the fact that type systems are logic languages should be uncontroversial given that that's what the Curry Howard Correspondence is about. Though I'm not very well read I think that using "complete" generic logic languages/solver (as a component) in solving type equations ought to be well trodden ground, my first thought went to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk">github.com/rust-lang/chalk</a> as one example. I'd be looking at what one might give up doing so as the reason why it doesn't happen more: speed? guaranteed termination? good error messages?</p>

<p>A question for ya’ll doing thinking on future of coding things:</p>
<p>When/if you think about the accessibility (read here as “a11y”) of the future of coding do you consider accessibility as an attribute of the folks using your thing (e.g. a need) or an attribute of your design (e.g. a feature)?</p>

<p>Fascinating video that popped up on my radar today of Stephen Wolfram demoing Mathematica in 1989 </p>
<p>I was quite blown away by how powerful and ahead of its time it was, even back then, with features like interactive programming in a very high level, multi-paradigm language for symbolic computation with rich, introspectable outputs and various thoughtful design decisions around interoperability, extensibility and API (as validated by how none of the API functions demo'd have changed AFAIK in 30+ years!)</p>

<p>This community is a big tent. We welcome folks from all backgrounds, and all levels of experience with computers. Heck, on our last episode, we celebrated an article written by someone who is, rounding down, a lawyer! A constant question I ponder is: what's the best way to introduce someone to the world of FoC? If someone is a workaday programmer, or a non-programmer, what can we share with them to help them understand our area of interest?</p>

They might ask, "Why should typical computer users bother learning to program?" Well, that's the wrong question! Instead, we should start broader. Why do we use computers? What do we use them to do? What happens when they don't do what we want? Who controls what they do? Will this ever change? What change do we want?

<p>I've been trying a new format for my weekly devlog updates. I started by recording myself 'reading them out loud' a few months ago. And it's stuck, and I have no plans of stopping, and they're including more-and-more ad-libbing, so I've decided to make it official. So... now I'm doing the weekly 'TODEPOND PONDCAST'. Mostly as a bonus for supporters, but the occasional public one, <a href="https://todepond.substack.com/p/todepond-pondcast-todepond-times">like this one</a>.</p>

<p>I think I figured out how I want to visualize a logic program executing in a debugger. A tree of trees. Chess-style variation tree navigator, where each node represents a search step and shows the search tree and bindings at that time, plus where the new unification clause was found in the source code. Anyone ever seen a logic debugger like that?</p>

<h2>Thinking Together</h2>
<p>💭 The reality of abstractions by <strong>Daniel Buckmaster</strong></p>

<p>In Episode 66 there was a long discussion about an idea I've come to know as  <em>the reality of abstractions</em> . I got that phrasing from David Deutsch in The Beginning Of Infinity.</p>
<p>I've long wanted to write about this in connection to programming, where we talk a lot about "abstractions", but in a very different sense* to the way Deutsch does. In lieu of doing that (which sounds like a lot of work) I will just post some of my favourite Deutsch quotes about it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reductionism and holism are both mistakes. In reality, explanations do not form a hierarchy with the lowest level being the most fundamental. Rather, explanations at any level of emergence can be fundamental. Abstract entities are real, and can play a role in causing physical phenomena. Causation is itself such an abstraction.</p>
<p>When we use theories about emergent physical quantities to explain the behaviour of water in a kettle, we are using an abstraction - an ‘idealized’ model of the kettle that ignores most of its details - as an approximation to a real physical system. But when we use a computer to investigate prime numbers, we are doing the reverse: we are using the physical computer as an approximation to an abstract one which perfectly models prime numbers. Unlike any real computer, the latter never goes wrong, requires no maintenance, and has unlimited memory and unlimited time to run its program.</p>
<p>Abstractions are essential to a fuller explanation. You know that if your computer beats you at chess, it is really the program that has beaten you, not the silicon atoms or the computer as such. 
 <em>[Nor, I would add, the arrangements of pixels on the screen which symbolize knights, pawns, etc.]</em> 
 The abstract program is instantiated physically as a high-level behaviour of vast numbers of atoms, but the explanation of why it has beaten you cannot be expressed without also referring to the program in its own right. That program has also been instantiated, unchanged, in a long chain of different physical substrates, including neurons in the brains of the programmers and radio waves when you downloaded the program via wireless networking, and finally as states of long- and short-term memory banks in your computer. The specifics of that chain of instantiations may be relevant to explaining how the program reached you, but it is irrelevant to why it beat you: there, the content of the knowledge (in it, and in you) is the whole story. That story is an explanation that refers ineluctably to abstractions; and therefore those abstractions exist, and really do affect physical objects in the way required by the explanation.</p>

<p>To connect this to the content of the episode - I think all the different representations of a cube on a screen are "real". The parts that you might dismiss as not having an "effect on the world", like the data structures in RAM, or the textual representation stored on disk, are as unavoidably real at their own levels of abstraction.</p>
<p>*Colloquially, I think working programmers use "abstraction" to mean things ranging from "I can ignore the details 'below' this point" to "I can <a href="https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0015">compress</a> this implementation into fewer syntax tokens". A <a href="https://www.pathsensitive.com/2022/03/abstraction-not-what-you-think-it-is.html">contrary view</a> from Dijkstra, which I think is closer to Deutsch's view, is abstraction as "a new semantic layer in which one can be absolutely precise".</p>

<p>The reason that modern web development is

 is that no one really wants things to be simple. We just think we do, while our choices prove otherwise.</p>

<p>later, continuing…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The same is often true of complexity. The real test is the question “what are you willing to sacrifice to achieve simplicity?” If the answer is “nothing”, then you don’t actually love simplicity at all, it’s your lowest priority.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I say “sacrifice”, I don’t mean that choosing simplicity will mean you are worse off overall – simplicity brings massive benefits. But it does mean that there will be some things that tempt you to believe you are missing out.</p>
<p>Looking beyond the inflammatory fun title, how do ya’ll think this relates to the future of coding? Is a reason that visual programming is often just around the corner because folks aren’t willing to shed some of the complexity (read also as “power” or “flexibility”) of existing programming systems?</p>

<p>A nice essay on programming languages, but with a message that is much more general: <a href="https://journal.infinitenegativeutility.com/leaving-haskell-behind">journal.infinitenegativeutility.com/leaving-haskell-behind</a></p>
<p>It's about the tension between "make better technology", "use start-of-the-art technology", and "use boring (but stable and well understood) technology". Different goals, different tools.</p>
<p>Another example I have experienced a lot: mathematics and physics. Mathematicians work on new mathematics, mathematical physicists introduce state-of-the-art mathematics into physics, and all other physicists use 100-year-old mathematics from textbooks. And each group complains about the attitude of the two others.</p>

<p>A little bit of Rules as Code in Unit: "a person can write a will if they are 18 or at least 14 and in the military". The checkbox indicates if they are military, the number field is their age, and the text field is the answer to whether they can write a will. What's interesting is that the diagram illustrates the reasons. If they qualify both ways, both paths are yellow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Critical code studies is the application of the hermeneutics of the humanities to the interpretation of the extra-functional significance of computer source code. “Extra” here does not mean “outside of” or “apart from” but instead it refers to a significance that is “growing out of” an understanding of the functioning of the code.</p>

<p>This piece also links to a few other interesting resources on the subject, including, the <a href="https://electronicbookreview.com/essay/critical-code-studies/">initial manifesto for critical code studies.</a></p>
<p>I also liked this quote,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Still, reading code, even <em>without</em> interpreting its cultural significance, can be no easy task. Ask a professional programmer who inherits legacy code to maintain or, worse yet, to improve, and they will tell you about the dread of sorting out just-in-time code, minimally documented, written with hasty patches, full of compromises and workarounds. Even those who write their code in artistic projects can be shy about sharing their code out of embarrassment and self-consciousness. This shame is a product of the “encoded chauvinism” of programming culture, one that can be fostered on the internet as much as it is in classrooms

<p>I thought this article on why <a href="https://www.sfwriter.com/wordstar.htm">some writers use an old word processor called WordStar</a> was interesting. I wonder if there are any implications here for editing programs? Some of the ideas — like comments — we usually take for granted in programming. But maybe there are some other worth-while take-aways?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me speak generally for a moment. I've concluded that there are two basic metaphors for pre-computer writing. One is the long-hand manuscript page. The other is the typewritten page. Most word processors have decided to emulate the second — and, at first glance, that would seem to be the logical one to adopt. But, as a creative writer, I am convinced that the long-hand page is the better metaphor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider: On a long-hand page, you can jump back and forth in your document with ease. You can put in bookmarks, either actual paper ones, or just fingers slipped into the middle of the manuscript stack. You can annotate the manuscript for yourself with comments like "Fix this!" or "Don't forget to check these facts" without there being any possibility of you missing them when you next work on the document. And you can mark a block, either by circling it with your pen, or by physically cutting it out, without necessarily having to do anything with it right away. The entire document is your workspace.</p>
<p>On a typewritten page, on the other hand, you are forced to deal with the next sequential character. Your thoughts are focussed serially on the typing of the document. If you're in the middle of a line halfway down page 7, your only easy option is to continue on that line. To go backwards to check something is difficult, to put in a comment that won't show when your document is read by somebody else is impossible, and so on. Typing is a top-down, linear process, not at all conducive to the intuitive, leaping-here-and-there kind of thought human beings are good at.</p>

<p>💻 <a href="https://resheet.dev">resheet.dev: A notes-spreadsheet-hybrid for programmers</a> via <strong>Daniel Krüger</strong></p>

<p>I'm currently building <a href="https://resheet.dev">resheet.dev</a>, a notion-spreadsheet-hybrid. Started because I often ran into limitations with Notion and with spreadsheets. In Notion I wanted to be able to just do some calculations (or even have some embedded spreadsheet). Spreadsheets are nice, but I always ran into limitations. I always thought these could easily be overcome by having a more feature-complete programming language. Because I previously failed very hard by being too ambitious, I tried to keep this project simple. ReSheet runs JavaScript with React because of the vast ecosystem and wide adoption.</p>
<p>It was important to me that it's core is simple and extensible: Everything revolves around the concept of a "Block", which can be thought of like a cell in a spreadsheet. Blocks can be nested and you're able to write and then use your custom Block completely in ReSheet itself. As ReSheet itself is just one big Block you can embed ReSheet in itself.</p>
<p>Maybe sometime in the future I'll get to work on a Block for visual and interactive programming, but currently I'm trying to get it reliably working and useful in the current state.</p>
<p>I'd love to hear your feedback and to answer any questions! (Documentation is still lacking. Currently working on adding some example documents (in ReSheet) to better show what's possible)</p>

<p>there's not enough information to recover them from url itself but since they are still working I should resolve them to the originals as fast as possible in case that service is turned off too 😕</p>

<p>Today, I'm trying to get function signatures for all the std lib stuff in JS… at runtime. Current attempt is converting various d.ts files from the typescript package (like, say, es5.d.ts) into a JSON file with just the bits I need. If that fails, I might try parsing the official WebIDL files (that are used to generate these d.ts files — at least, the dom ones).</p>
<p>If there's a much more obvious way to get this info, let me know. I basically just want something that, for a given function (eg: Array.prototype.splice), gives me some basic signature info (eg: 1-2 args with rest, first arg is called "index", optional second is called "delete", rest is "items"). If all else fails I'll just do .length on these functions, but I'd prefer to get names too.</p>

<p>I've been fixing some bugs in the state-machine node-type in my visual programming system "code-flow-canvas" and also added a small media-library node-type which can be used by the show-image node-type.</p>
<p>The show-image node-type can be controlled by the state-machine together with some UI node-types (button and slider).</p>
<p>The show-image node-type also has an ability to change it's css and use flow parameters/variables (currently only the incoming value of a event/value special input-type.. I want to make this more generic in the near future so that you can send custom property-bags "over the wire" to other nodes).</p>
<p>The timeline slider doesn't work together nicely with the slider node-type yet, so I have to work on that further.</p>
<p>This example can be found on <a href="https://demo.codeflowcanvas.io">demo.codeflowcanvas.io</a> in the "examples" drop down: "Simple state machine with image and brightness". </p>

<p>Every week I will dump from tinyletter and re upload one month of the <a href="https://newsletter.futureofcoding.org/">Future of Coding Newsletter</a> and publish it as a message here, that way we can all go over past conversations and links and I have a reason and rhythm to make them available again.</p>
<p>A month re uploaded per week will allow me to catch up faster than "realtime" but still at a pace I can probably keep.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, I noticed how Juan Benet (founder of IPFS) was keeping <a href="https://github.com/jbenet/random-ideas/issues">a list of random software engg ideas</a> in a github repo as issues. Since then I too started keeping my own list of "RFH"s ("Request for Hacks") - similar to Request for Comments and Request for Startups - here: <a href="https://codeberg.org/nilesh/request-for-hacks/issues">codeberg.org/nilesh/request-for-hacks/issues</a> and recently made it public.</p>
<p>Posting ideas in a place where public discussion can take place seems like an excellent way to get open feedback or review. I encourage other programmers to do the same. Perhaps,  <code>/&lt;username&gt;/request-for-hacks</code>  can become a standard way to discover these. 🙂</p>

<p>There's a puzzle game conference called ThinkyCon that's currently running. Some of the talks are about editor tooling (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kgXBifWQXI&amp;t=5591s">like this one</a>, about the dev tooling used for the game A Monster's Expedition), which feels roughly relevant to this community. But there's one talk in particular that I  <em>must</em>  draw your attention to because this is the internet and I need to earn points. The talk is called "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kgXBifWQXI&amp;t=12992s">Rewinding: moving time backwards in planning-based games</a>". The first example they use of a game that ought to have rewind but doesn't is Opus Magnum, a game by Zachtronics that is the spiritual successor to SpaceChem. I'd argue that both of these games are visual programming environments, and that this talk is basically an argument that visual programming deserves the ability to rewind time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fabrik is a visual programming environment - a kit of computational and user-interface components that can be "wired" together to build new components and useful applications. Fabrik diagrams utilize bidirectional dataflow connections as a shorthand for multiple paths of flow. Built on object-oriented foundations, Fabrik components can compute arbitrary objects as outputs. Music and animation can be programmed in this way and the user interface can even be extended by generating graphical structures that depend on other data. An interactive type system guards against meaningless connections. As with simple dataflow, each Fabrik component can be compiled into an object with access methods corresponding to each of the possible paths of data propagation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In presentation I tried to show the possibility and need for better tools. I did a short overview of existing FoC projects, talked a bit about project I am working on: a generic tree editor (structure editor) that doesn't tied up to any PL. I also talked about idea of designing PL by balancing Order and Chaos, ideas that I got from Jordan Peterson.</p>
<p>I believe that breakaway from text-based editing towards structure-based is an inevitable event for future of programming.</p>
<p>I also have some other ideas about programming languages that I would like to build on top of this tree editing platform, but it is not covered in presentation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The web we have today is slowly becoming a glorified app store, just the easiest way among many to download software that communicates with distant servers using closed protocols and schemas, making it functionally identical to the software ecosystem that existed before the web. How did we get here? If the effort to build a Semantic Web had succeeded, would the web have looked different today? Or have there been so many forces working against a decentralized web for so long that the Semantic Web was always going to be stillborn?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our primary goal when designing our multiplayer system was for it to be no more complex than necessary to get the job done. A simpler system is easier to reason about which then makes it easier to implement, debug, test, and maintain. Since Figma isn't a text editor, we didn't need the power of OTs and could get away with something less complicated.</p>
<p>Figma's tech is instead inspired by something called CRDTs, which stands for Conflict-free Replicated Data Types. CRDTs refer to a collection of different data structures commonly used in distributed systems. All CRDTs satisfy certain mathematical properties which guarantee eventual consistency. If no more updates are made, eventually everyone accessing the data structure will see the same thing.</p>

<p>My sister asked whether her middle-school son should pick the choice of a block programming language (like Scratch), JavaScript, or C# for a class he's in.  I claimed that he'll learn the same fundamentals with blocks minus the frustration, tedium, tea ceremony, and incantations associated with the others.  To prove that the block program has the real creativity and that moving to the others is practically automatable, I took <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/605658/">may favorite Scratch program</a> and had Chat translate it into JavaScript and C# <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/02215935-c0b8-4fc9-9bf9-94f0b3fab613">chat.openai.com/share/02215935-c0b8-4fc9-9bf9-94f0b3fab613</a>.  The results seemed promising.  Chat even made helpful observations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Translating the same Scratch program to C# requires a different approach because C# is often used in desktop applications, and there's no direct equivalent of the Canvas API like in web technologies. However, you can use Windows Forms or WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) for graphical applications in C#. Here, I'll provide an example using Windows Forms to create a simple drawing application that mimics the Scratch program's behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you check my conversation, you'll see I start asking what a "partial class" is having never heard the term.  Chat parroted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using partial classes in this way provides flexibility. You can start with all your code in one file for simplicity. Then, if the class grows or you decide to use the designer, you can easily refactor the designer-generated code into its own file without changing the class's functionality. This approach keeps your custom code separate from the auto-generated code, making it easier to read and maintain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I explained that every language, every tool has many such conventions. You learn the ones reverent to whatever you're doing right now, but learning them all is impossible. Instead the real skill is knowing that you don't know and being able to find out quickly. We're lucky that a these things are obscure, come up often, and are discussed on the Web. Thus LLMs are especially good at helping with dumb programming problems.</p>
<p>So why use the established languages besides Chat knowing them well?  I thought of three reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expressivity — Blocks will get a beginner pretty far, but you'll find the others have constructs that helpful for saying things that would be very hard with blocks.  You won't appreciate scratch until you feel the itch.</li>
<li>Causal Powers — The block system will let you do things in class you'll learn core ideas, but the blocks themselves won't work everywhere.  JavaScript, on the other hand, works all over on the web, and C# has its own ecosystem.  Often there's bridging, but also one or other language will be the most natural one for certain kinds of work.</li>
<li>Scale — With big and medium sized programs being done with text, editors for wrangling it, and version control for keeping track of it exist.  They can we weirdly powerful and janky.  But you're liable to start having a hard time keeping track of blocks when it takes a dozen or more screens to fit them all.</li>
</ul>

<p>I recently thought about combining natural language prompts in code notebooks interface because it seemed like a great use case to me. While working with data, a mixture of low-level capability of writing code and a high-level capability to write transformations or visualization instructions in natural language can be a great advantage. You can code when you want to, and completely skip and offload to an LLM by writing natural language instructions! The notebook executes code and prompts in a single context. Here's something you can try that implements this idea: <a href="https://try-slate.com/">try-slate.com</a></p>

<p>I listened to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/terminology-take-100835945">a podcast about Hest recently</a> (that I wasn't even on!), and have been thinking about taking another crack at it. I'm in a really different situation now, work/life wise, and am less inhibited by idealistic ambitions (like a bunch of NIH making me write my own 3D engine, or an obsession with conceptual purity forcing me to make everything bootstrapped). Now the biggest blocker is that I only have scraps of free time, and I've been using all of it to make music. Oh, how I miss being 20 and free from obligation!</p>

<p>I've made a new form field control for arrays of objects. The properties that go into the object can be specified and in this example I've used it to implement a simple gradient color node. This example can be viewed at <a href="https://demo.codeflowcanvas.io/gl">demo.codeflowcanvas.io/gl</a> and then select "Moving circle" from the examples drop-down (I just noticed a weird bug on iOS.. so please just try on desktop).</p>

<p>Is there any wisdom on  <em>how to best lay out code in a visual code browser</em> ?</p>
<p>In my experience, code can be layed out either more horizontally on long lines or more vertically on short lines. This is controlled by setting a criterion for how many levels of nesting there can be before a node switches to a multiline layout. Long lines use space efficiently but tend to get hard to read. Short lines are easier to read, as tokens of similar significance line up in columns, but tend to take up much vertical space while leaving most of the horizontal space unused, as the average line is just one key and one value.</p>
<p>Shall I accept that code gets very vertical, and use the free horizontal space to add multilevel navigation panels, or is there a third option that is more horizontal while still easy to read? I can go really fancy and add tables and multiple columns, since I have full control over the layout function, but not all code is regular enough to fit a tabular format, and I cannot require the person editing the code to manually bikeshed it by editing whitespace or dragging around visual nodes. I've seen the <a href="https://gitlab.com/procps-ng/procps/-/blob/master/src/top/top.c">horrors of manually bikeshedded plain-text languages</a> and the horrors of node-based languages where the programmer makes a simple one node change and then has to drag all the nodes around so they line up. Are there any examples of interesting solutions to look at?</p>
<p>Here's how I mean a more horizontal layout:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[redacted]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's how I mean a more vertical layout:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[redacted]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the more horizontal layout, I can barely parse the surprise structure at a glance, and I can barely see if I've made a mistake in editing. It takes a lot less screen space though.</p>

<p>I’d like to prefer a dataflow style solution over a constraint solver. I’ve been reading up on why this problem feels hard and its similarity to the “view update problem” in databases, I’m curious if there’s a widely accepted solution that I’m missing.</p>

<p>Yes, the time has finally come! I'll share a link to my visual programming project online! I've been mainly showing some video's on the devlog channel about the project.</p>
<p>Warning upfront: Although I've been working on this for quite some time (I even started from the ground up last year after working on my previous visual programming project for multiple years).. there's still a lot of work to be done and bugs to be fixed. The UI/UX is far from perfect but it is demo-able enough I think. However, it's still just in "demo-stage" and not usable by other projects (I haven't build any npm packages for integrating or vs-code extension for example).</p>
<p>My goal is to make a generic visual programming system (VPS) with which domain or application specific vpl's can be made. For now I am implementing 2 vpl's on top of the current base: a flow-based-programming inspired system and a "visual shader-toy".</p>
<p>Since the tool is an infinite canvas, you can zoom and drag the canvas using mouse/wheel/touchpad. I've spend some time getting touchscreen support, but more work definitely needs to be done there.</p>
<p>When you open up one of the editors, you can use the dropdown in the top-menu to load an example flow.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here's the link: <a href="https://codeflowcanvas.io">codeflowcanvas.io</a> : there are 2 demo playgrounds in which you can play around.</p>
<p>I'll post some more details in the 🧵.</p>

<p>A little thing like an 'edit' button introduces cascading issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>LÖVE (in combination with mobile restrictions) won't let me modify code files in place. I have to overlay my changes in a new location.</li>
<li>But now I can't pick up any upgrades to my app. Upgrades modify code files in place, but any overlay persists (otherwise you'd completely lose your changes after upgrading).</li>
<li>But hey I have a programmable editor here! I'll just create a new file called 'scratch' with a one-liner to blow away the overlay. (With my app user's hat on, I know in this case my changes are minor in a way that I don't with my app developer's hat on.)</li>
<li>(A few hours later.) Wait, now none of my changes are having any effect. And they're completely blown away when I go back to the code.</li>
<li>🤦 Oh it's that 'scratch' file still hanging around. So it needs to be a 2-liner. I have to make any changes I want to the file system -- and then delete 'scratch' to make this a one-time operation.</li>
<li>I could try to create a screen of helpers for this, along with a comment that says, "insert file system operations here" after which is a delete of 'scratch'.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this way I find myself playing meta-Sokoban.. 🙄</p>

<p>Simple shortest-path routing to reduce some of the drudgery in Sokoban. Integrated with undo.</p>
<p>Next up: routing while pushing a single crate without moving any other crates. That feels more complicated than this glorified breadth-first search. In particular, I'm not yet sure how to detect cycles. Moving a crate can involve being in the same place over and over again. I think I need to hash the player's location in combination with the crate's location 🤔</p>

<p>Another concept I've been ideating about is how to bring Literate Programming, by Donald Knuth, into my daily work, which involves modern tools and stacks like VSCode and Node.js. I believe inline, rich text snippets which are integrated with some kind of personal knowledge management system is the way to go. This way, instead of having comments like this:</p>
<p>// TODO: Refactor this to use the revised approach</p>
<p>It instead would look like using Notion or Obsidian inside VSCode. So above a function, would be a small window into a single page that describes a single function. You can do anything here, like linking references that are relevant to the design of the function. Or you could even have a lengthy design document that explains why a function was written a certain way. Going even further, you could have a page which describes the evolution of a function over time, why at the beginning it was written a certain way, why changes had to be made, and why it looks the way it looks right now.</p>
<p>And added bonus of this approach is that now it's possible to have a single source of truth for docs and your code. So rather than maintaining a separate Docusaurus that has to be updated to sync it with evolution in code, you can just maintain documentation in line. And then to publish developer docs online, you merely just take all the little snippets above each function and then aggregate them onto a single page.</p>
<p>Basically, this approach is powerful because instead of 1D strings of text, now you can have the power of rich text in your code. Including diagrams, and even embedding other programs through <iframes> would be possible. And when your code needs to be compiled, all these rich text snippets are simply removed.</iframes></p>

<p>Jakob Nielsen asserts that accessibility has failed to serve disabled users because of a mistaken focus on standards. This approach is unable to address the wide variety of disabilities, and because it is by definition a derivative of a GUI, it is doomed to provide a second-class experience to e.g. blind users. He points out differing needs by older and less literate users, and proposes generative UI as a promising solution.</p>

<p>A super simple demo, of a super simple feature.</p>
<p>(more of an experiment really)</p>
<p>The assumptions is that an <em>infinite canvas is great for creative / generative tasks</em> .</p>
<p>But then  <em>for processing a linear workflow, might be better / more natural / impose less cognitive burden</em> .</p>
<p>That is what we’re trying to explore with ‘Zen Mode’ 😉</p>

<p>I've been developing documentation for my language. The nice thing about it is that all the code snippets are embedded editor instances that allow you to run and play with the examples.</p>
<p>This week I've been writing a page to document effect types. There one of the key features of it. I've made a video where I play around with them.</p>
<p>Let me know if this does a decent job of explaining effect types, and particularly effect handlers.</p>

<p>My overall goal for the year is to —finally— learn how to do real work on the GPU. As a motivating short-term goal, I'm building a visualization of magnetic fields, as VFX for a video about regenerative braking that my company is producing. I'm doing all this (bear with me) inside a new drawing app that I'm developing, which heretofore rendered to SVG, but which I'd like to abstract so that it can render in a more API-agnostic way, as a prelude to making it portable (with an eye to Swift+Metal, perhaps eventually Vision Pro). Then (continue to bear with me) I'll have a nice foundation for continuing some of my visual programming experiments. So no, these screenshots here aren't  <em>strictly</em> FoC-relevant. But it is stuff that I'm building as a test case… within a new graphics tech stack that I'm building… with a goal of supporting some new visual programming stuff that I'd like to do.</p>
<p>I won't be posting much stuff here until it becomes more directly FoC relevant, but if you'd like to follow along regardless I'll be <a href="https://mastodon.social/@spiralganglion">posting more regularly on Mastodon</a>.</p>

<p>Aside: Magnetic fields are actually 4D phenomena (x/y/z/t).  We use equations to think about fields by reducing fields to 2D so that we may scribble our thoughts down onto clay tablets and papyrus.  There is this new medium - called “computers” - that might let us break free of 2D-only expression of 4D phenomena, using, say, 3D (x/y/t) while expressing the 4th D (z) using a trick that humanity invented, called “perspective”.  Fields might be more-than-4D phenomena but our brains can only perceive 4 dimensions at this time.</p>

<p>when you all work on a Future of Cod <em>ing</em>  flavored tool, do you think about ways to bake in certain sorts of interactions.</p>
<p><em>As example:</em> </p>
<p>React lets ya build accessible, localized experiences, but it also lets ya make something that is wholly inaccessible, too. It is sort of agnostic on that front. Could a tool “force” an accessible experience, or be more strongly biased towards something like that?</p>
<p>This line of thinking isn’t restricted to accessibility, it just seemed like an easy fruit to reach for when writing an example. Is this the kinda thing other folks think about when designing stuff? Do you have examples of it?</p>

<p>I have always thought Named Data Networking (a future infrastructure project older than IPFS) is really promising: <a href="https://named-data.net/">named-data.net</a></p>
<p>Think instead of naming locations, naming the data you're requesting, so it can be pulled from any host as efficiently as possible</p>

<p>Generating initial content for an any workspace.</p>
<p><em>We are, by design, about non-linear explorations, in that setting it’s not always easy to start.</em> </p>
<p>A bit like sitting in front of a blank page. This feature is like priming / toning the canvas 😉</p>
<p>I personally think visually a lot of the time (spatially / moving pictures), but  <em>the</em>   <em>trigger for starting a thread of thought is quite often a word, term, phrase or a sentence</em> .</p>
<p>This feature is about that kind of exploration, you drop a word and it ripples out into all kinds of useful directions.</p>
<p>(of course, being useful is the trick here, this is very minimal atm)</p>
<p>The way the app is set-up it’s not difficult for us to generate those workspaces (the blocks are Clojure maps in a re-frame db), so if it turns out that it’s useful we’ll probably generate more content.</p>

<p>Not my main work, but a fun little programming project that's relevant in a number of ways, despite apparently being more about the Past of Coding, than the Future.</p>
<p>I wrote a small (&lt;500 lines of code) BASIC to JS compiler, that lets me run the programs from the class book <em>101 BASIC Computer Games</em> from 1978. It's interesting for two reasons I think: 1. for those who want to learn about languages and compilers, this provides a very simple example 2. philosophically, I think BASIC really exemplifies the Worse is Better approach outlined by  Richard Gabriel and covered in a FOC podcast. It is a terrible language in many ways, but it was small enough to be stored in a 4k ROM and be used to to useful things on an early microcomputer with only 4k of RAM. If we had waited for machines with enough memory to run Lisp, Smalltalk or Algol, the microcomputer revolution would have been delayed by a decade or more.

<p>I’ve been sketching multiplayer UIs. Folks who came to the most recent London meet will recognise these from my demo. I’m trying not to converge on anything right now — how we interact with AI NPCs is still so open.</p>

<p>A look at Folk Computer (ofshoot from Dynamicland by Omar Rizwan and Andrés Cuervo) through Emily Dickinson’s poetry</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 19th-century poet, whose verse still resonates with its open-ended sense of how language produces meaning, is a model for a group of Brooklyn coders inventing a more humane computer.</p>

<p>Coworker just shared this book and I was surprised not to see it in the search history here (maybe I missed it). I thought this group would be interested: <a href="https://livecodingbook.toplap.org/book/#">livecodingbook.toplap.org/book/#</a></p>
<p>To give some scope:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In asking “What is live coding?,” our intention is not to fix or define but rather to explore how live coding  <em>opens up</em> . Live coding is about people interacting with the world, and each other, in real time, via code. Live coding is about making software  <em>live</em> .</p>
<p>The first part is more practice focused, offering an account of the origins, development, and aspirations associated with the evolution of live coding alongside presenting documentation and examples of live coding practice. The second part is more speculative and conceptual in its register, allowing space for discussion of the many ways live coding reflects and informs wider cultural and political concerns.</p>

<p>This might fall under "thinking-together", but I'm throwing this here as it specifically relates to AI. For context, I've been working to integrate an LLM into an existing application.  If "prompt engineering" is part of the future of coding, here are some challenges to expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Non determinism:</em> I can repeat a prompt and get back drastically different results, in both content and format.</li>
<li>
<em>Capabilities:</em> I feel like I'm constantly probing to discover the capabilities and limits of the model. Every interaction is similar to being presented with a blank canvas: What should I ask? What can I ask? Is there something that I could ask that I am forgetting about? Can I reword my prompt slightly and (potentially) get better results? This leads to a lot of experimentation.</li>
<li>
<em>Expectations</em>: We are tricked into believing the LLM comprehends what we are saying, when it's really just a giant prediction table. Then we are disappointed when it gives less-than-satisfactory replies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Compare this to programming against a traditional API:</p>
<ul>
<li>On in the input side, an API constrains the vocabulary. With an LLM, everything is fair game.</li>
<li>On the output side, I can guess (or learn) the effect of a given API call. With an LLM, it's all probabilistic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Curious about others experiences here, ways to reason about these models, techniques for overcoming, etc...</p>

<p>HitchStory is an open source bolt-on for pytest that, lets you build integration tests which autogenerate scenario-based documentation about your app.</p>
<p>The tests are written in type-safe StrictYAML. In the website example, running the tests generates screenshots and a GIF of the user story from playwright. These are all combined into step-by-step markdown documentation that non developers can follow that explain how your app works.</p>

<p>I am going to need to come up with a more robust way to allow my users to edit legislative text in a way that is user friendly, and forces them to stick to a predefined data structure. I'm wondering if anyone has tried to use tools like slate.js or ProseMirror for that sort of thing, or have other suggestions. It's legislation, so I want the editing environment to be as text-like as I can manage.</p>

<p>Software Engineers do not write code.</p>
<p>Implementors (coders) write code.</p>
<p>Engineers think (deeply) about what code needs to be written, and, what trade-offs need to be made to simply make the system work.</p>
<p>Production Engineers think about making trade-offs so that the system is “efficient” along one or more dimensions (speed, space, cost, etc.), but, only after the initial system is working and shown to satisfy end-users’ needs.</p>
<p>Current popular programming languages, like Rust, Haskell, Python, etc., conflate all of these issues together, thus,  making the code more difficult to design.  Conflating issues together like this has a name: “cottage industry”.</p>
<p>Then, there’s Software Architecture, Maintenance, Testing, Q/A, Security, etc., etc.</p>
<p>The above pattern is visible in other, older professions, such as building construction.  Software might re-use these ideas and re-purpose them for creating electronic machines.</p>
<p>Note, too, that more-established professions use diagrams to augment the use of written words when communicating designs (blueprints, schematics, molecular diagrams, etc.).</p>
<p>Note, too, that more-established professions use elements that are completely isolated and decoupled from one another.  This assumption (of inherent non-coupling) is violated by most popular programming languages.</p>

<p>Our conversation is split into two parts. In this part we discuss: paradigm shifts in programming tools, the viability of visual programming for general purpose programming, the pros and cons of tight coupling of tools into one bigger tool, usability possibilities that have not been explored for visual programming systems, and the things to watch out for when exploring functionally infinite design spaces.</p>

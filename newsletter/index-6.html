<p>Just curious for all your thoughts, is being ahead of your time a good thing? I’m thinking of a conversation I had with <strong>@Toby Schachman</strong> in the Cuttle discord a while back where he mentioned that Cuttle aimed certain details at a status-quo of programming style unlike it’s predecessor Apparatus, I thought that was quite profound. I’m thinking also of Fortran vs Lisp (or perhaps Forth). When is it  <em>not</em>  worth it to meet people where they are?</p>

<p>I wanted to bounce 2 terms I've been thinking of off of this group:</p>
<p>I dig visual programming, but think the term is like a little bit of a brain poison because it isn't really descriptive of the goals, and, like, almost all textual programming is inherently visual, too...just...in the way text is.</p>
<p>I think <a href="http://ivanish.ca/">Ivan Reese</a> was the person I first heard float the term "spatial programming," which I dig, but at least for me, it also misses the real value add of what I'm looking for in a "visual" system.</p>
<p>So, the two terms I've been kicking around:</p>
<ul>
<li>relational programming</li>
<li>cartographic programming</li>
</ul>
<p>Neither are perfect, and both feel exhaustingly pretentious (a good thing, may haps?) but my intention with both terms is to highlight that these sorts of systems, unlike text-based programming, help make the relationships between different elements (classes, data flow, inheritance, etc.) meaningful using information other than similar names.</p>
<p>Useful? Stupid? Prior art?</p>

<p>Given recent discussion of  <em>what social scientists need from computing</em> (and is it plain-text scripting?), sharing this recent survey of cultural heritage visualization systems (16p). Section 3.4 (Granularity and Interactivity) will be especially interesting; the authors avoid flattening this idea to a 'file system'.</p>

<p>I see lots of folks here are interested in the intersection of programming and AI (to say little); I finally posted an example combining Unit and LLMs on X. It is a reactive graph for text reasoning and image generation. I start from a statement, then apply commands to transform it, ultimately rendering generated images. <a href="https://twitter.com/io_sammt/status/1748683055605195087?s=46&amp;t=kvyalr_gJlbdW-jQJstTcg">Take a look </a>.

<p>When working on my language I've been frustrated by the lack of symbols and extra information for my JIT compiled code. There is a way to get this kind of information, but it involves building an elf binary in memory. Way too much overhead for this point in my development.</p>
<p>So I started building my own debugger frontend to lldb. Not much to show right now. But the idea is to specifically tailor it to my language. So you'll get a compiler explorer like experience, but also be able to view the stack and heap and all of that live. See the language level values stored in there.</p>
<p>The fun part to for me was how to convey the information I need to the debugger. The answer came from the standard JIT interface. How do you tell your debugger things? You make a function that the debugger has a breakpoint in. The function does nothing in the body. You just pass some args that tells the debugger where in memory to get the information it needs. Super clever. So now I'm working on passing all my compiler metadata to the debugger frontend so it can know how to render things intelligently.</p>

<p><img alt="Youtube Thumbnail" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/ApOfXliyGqc/hqdefault.jpg"></p>
<p>This week I spend a lot of time adding basic keyboaed support in the visual programming system that I am developing. For productivity I think that just using a mouse for creating a visual flow is not enough. One of the reasons why we are so productive when using a text editor for programming is the usage of the keyboard I think. Off course it's not the only reason but I do think it's of major influence. </p>
<p>So being able to use the keyboard for visual programming seems like a very good idea. In <a href="https://youtu.be/ApOfXliyGqc">this video</a> I show exactly that.</p>
<p>Currently after every update to the flow, the tabindex is set on all the nodes and input elements. In normal webapps this is not a good idea, but here it is the only way to give the browser the proper and logical tab order. When tabbing through the flow, the camera is focused on the selected node overriding default browser scroll-behavior when a focused element is out of the current view. Using ctrl+a you can add a new node and also select the thumbs for the connection.  </p>
<p>Furthermore I've added some other features like being able to run a flow using the keyboard (ctrl + Enter) and opening the properties popup. A missing feature is being able to add a new node before the currently selected node.</p>
<p>Lots of small tweaks were needed to make this work, but I am glad I spend the time because this also increases the accessibility.</p>

<p><a href="http://ivanish.ca/">Ivan Reese</a>, in episode 9 of a podcast I can’t tell if I’m supposed to know about or not, you asked, “Where is [data] going when you’re throwing it away, and when you rewind, how does it come back?” And I don’t think it has answers that you’d want to apply directly to your situation, but  ~<em><em>Feynman’s Lectures on Computing</em></em>~  comes back to the idea of reversible computing again and again with various playful metaphorical lenses. I think that at the very least it might be a nice way to take a break and think about the problem from a physicist’s perspective now and then, if this is still a problem you’re working on.</p>

<p>I’ve been really into probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) lately. I had a few “aha” moments and I’m decidedly in the “hit everything with this hammer to figure out where the nails are” phase.</p>
<p>Anyway, is anybody here in a similar headspace? Or already experienced with PPLs?</p>
<p>Is anybody curious to enter this headspace with me? I reviewed the (online, free, programmable) book that brought me here: <a href="https://micro.alltom.com/2024/01/11/the-cognition-in.html">micro.alltom.com/2024/01/11/the-cognition-in.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The “Cognition” in Probabilistic Models of Cognition 📚 is the hardest part to get across when I recommend this book. Because the book isn’t “Bayes works, yawn.” It’s so much more interesting if you, like me, exist primarily in ML circles that focus on curve-fitting:
 What could be going on in our heads when we can’t tell that the two grid squares in that optical illusion are the same color?</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/glFRPjWWlzA">In this video</a>  I show a timeline slider with which you can scroll through the executed path of a visual flow program. Some node-types like variables and the node-tree-visualizer have there state being recorded for each execution.. so when moving through the timeline, these nodes are updated and especially with the node-tree-visualizer this gives a good overview of how a program/algorithm works (in this case quicksort). Instead of having to visualize this in your head , you see the effect of the program for each execution step and you can also inspect the variables like the left and right arrays and the pivot variable.</p>
<p>On the end of this month I hope to release a demo version of the project I am working on, so the last weeks I've also been fixing bugs and making other improvements. One of the bigger improvements is the way the moving message bubble is handled, it's now much smoother especially on lower execution speeds because of the use of requestAnimationFrame, it was on my wishlist from the beginning I implemented this but hadn't come around to it yet. </p>

<p>I really like the premise of this paper and the first few sections of this paper, framing hypermedia as an underlying medium in software.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hypermedia was introduced not as a subgenre of software, but as a different conceptualization of what software is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not too excited by their implemented solution though (Webstrates). Still, the premise can be taken in many other directions I imagine.</p>

<p>Not sure whether this is  <em>quite</em>  on topic for FoC, but I made a toy and I'm pleased with it.</p>
<p>I was inspired by <a href="http://www.inference.org.uk/dasher/">Dasher</a>, which uses the low entropy of natural language to make it possible to enter text using only a 1-dimensional input device. The core idea is to make the most likely next input take up a lot of space and thus make it easy to reach.</p>
<p>Most interactions we have with a computer involve low entropy input.</p>
<p>With (1) good models, and (2) a lossy encoding/decoding model that is easy for humans to use, you should be able to get away with entering a lot less.</p>
<p>For code, LLMs are pretty powerful models. And fuzzy matching is a pretty easy-to-use lossy encoding model.</p>

<h2>Our Work</h2>
<p>💬 <strong>Robin Allison</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://history.futureofcoding.org/history/weekly/2024/01/W2/share-your-work.html#2024-01-04T06:22:58.649Z">🧵 conversation</a></p>
<p>I really like TodePond's video "Screens in Screens in Screens". I've been wanting to do the same kinda thing with mathematical formulas instead of shapes, a kind of "formulas in formulas in formulas", but I'm an awful programmer so I'll describe some math you can do to that effect. Apologies in advance for the shoddy explanation though.</p>
<p>Here's a thing you can do with "screens". You can name screens. Start with some screens A B C. Then if C is inside A, and A and B are the same color, then there is a copy of C inside B. What do you call this copy? "The copy of B from A to C"? It will be convenient if we give it a symbolic name. Call it (A-&gt;B)C. Or if you are really hardcore you can call it just t(A,B,C) where t is a ternary operator describing the result of copying C from A to B. You may think to only consider (A-&gt;B)C when C is inside A, but the math becomes tractable if you consider all screens at once. Then we can stipulate some axioms:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>(A-&gt;A)B = B</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(A-&gt;B)A=B</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(B-&gt;C)(A-&gt;B)=(A-&gt;C)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(A-&gt;(X-&gt;Y)A)=(X-&gt;Y)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first axiom means if you are copying a screen from one screen to itself, you aren't changing anything. The second axiom is "obvious" except for considering (A-&gt;B)A in the first place. The third axiom means if you copy a screen from A to B and then from B to C that is the same as if you were to copy it from A to C directly. It is also shorthand for (B-&gt;C)((A-&gt;B)D) = (A-&gt;C)D for all screens D. The fourth axiom takes a bit more explaining. Basically we want this equation to be true whenever A is in X, and both sides are being used to copy something from A. But our theory at this point doesn't have a predicate for "A is contained in X" so we say it holds in all cases.</p>
<p>With these axioms you can show the operators (A-&gt;B) form an algebraic structure called a group: You can multiply them by performing one copy after the other (C-&gt;D)(A-&gt;B). This operation is associative (I mean, it must be), and has an identity element and inverses. The identity being (A-&gt;A) and the inverse of (A-&gt;B) being (B-&gt;A).</p>
<p>Another perspective is to view screens as points in an affine space (i.e. vector space without a specified origin). Then (A-&gt;B)C can be thought of as (B-A)+C, and each of the axioms above can be interpreted as vector equations. This isn't a good model though because it ends up saying some screens are the same when they should be different. You can still take the above axioms and show that screens form a generalization of affine spaces called torsors.</p>
<p>I'll share more if anybody is interested. It really needs a much longer write up, but I thought somebody might know if its already been done before.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I started a new series of blog posts (or “newsletters”, in Substack parlance) about  <em>simplicity</em> :</p>
<p>1 • <a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/on-simplicity">On simplicity</a> introduces the series with how my thinking about simplicity has changed over the years.</p>
<p>2 • <a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/on-simplicity-2-meaning-ful-design">Meaning-ful design</a> connects simplicity to meaning making and coherence.</p>
<p>3 • <a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/on-simplicity-3-familiarity">Familiarity</a> explores how complex things can be surprisingly simple and why we can’t ignore context.</p>
<p>4 • <a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/on-simplicity-4-reciprocal-realization">Reciprocal realization</a> frames design as a complex dynamic process of mutual adaptation between designer and designed object.</p>
<p>…  <em>I expect about four or five more posts coming after that, but I haven’t written them yet, so I have no idea.</em> 🙂</p>
<p>A lot of this draws on 4E cognitive science, design theory, and philosophy. As such it may perhaps be less technical than you would expect it to be, although I try much harder in this series to relate it more directly to programming and software development than in <a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/previously-a-recap">my last</a>.</p>
<p>And that’s why I post it here, today. I’m hoping to learn if this resonates at all with a technical audience, or if this is still too abstract. I know we’re all craving for the easily applicable  <em>Top 10 Things to Make Things Simple</em>  (and number 6 will surprise you), but I have reason to believe that it’s just not that… well… simple. But I think I’m slowly making progress towards synthesizing something valuable, even if I can’t express it as beautifully as I would like to. Yet.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think, and please ask any questions you may have (in thread or via DM). Appreciate your feedback!</p>

<p>Spinners are boring, so might as well get creative with AI UX for loading states, even with fast LLMs like Mixtral.</p>
<p>The thinking is to not only show multiplayer presence on our canvas, but also what the AI is doing and working on, including visualizing the code its writing in real-time.</p>

<p>I think I have a usable app development experience now on my tablet. I basically took my recent Lua Carousel and made a few changes. In Carousel (first clip) you start in the programming environment, each screen runs a separate script, scripts run in the background of the editor, and each screen manages its own canvas. The new setup (second clip) starts in the app, which takes over the entire device until I 'exit' into the programming environment. In the programming environment, screens are now just editors with a shared 'run' button and canvas. Hopefully I can now finish polishing this  ~turd~  app entirely on the tablet.</p>

<p>💡  Communicating programming ideas by <a href="http://ivanish.ca/">Ivan Reese</a></p>

<p>Someone reached out to ask me for more thoughts about communicating programming ideas through media other than the academic paper. I wrote a reply, and then decided it would be worth sharing here to see if other folks have their own inspirations they'd like to share, or ideas for how our industry can go  <em>paper-free</em>  ;)</p>
<hr>
<p>I feel like I owe reading an apology. I certainly try to play up my "crank" side on the podcast, but it does run the risk of mixing-up  <em>this is being silly</em> with  <em>this is thoughtful critique</em> .</p>
<p>I have tremendous reverence for the communicative potential of the written word. I just think there are some kinds of ideas that lend themselves better to other forms of expression, or some ideas that can't be written down.</p>
<p>For instance, it's very strange to me whenever I read a paper about HCI, especially if they're discussing GUI ideas. Sure, often these papers will be accompanied by a video. But, like, the work being described is about  <em>interacting with interfaces</em> . I think the work should be presented as an interface you can interact with!</p>
<p>I'm especially fond of <a href="http://worrydream.com">Bret</a>'s essays, naturally. <a href="https://ciechanow.ski">Bartosz</a> also does great work with visualization, though I feel like he leans a little too heavily on text and that the visualizations are too linear. <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com">Amit</a> also does excellent work, but he has the advantage that most of the things he demos are inherently about interactive graphics so they lend themselves naturally to this sort of presentation (not to diminish the incredible effort Amit puts in to these articles).</p>
<p>The thing I want to see more of is… people finding ideas that can  <em>only</em>  be expressed through interaction. I think successfully achieving this requires that someone work natively in interaction, a lot, for a long time. As a result, most of these ideas seem to emerge in the periphery of video games.</p>
<p>One of my favourite examples is <a href="https://w.itch.io/dys4ia">Dys4ia</a>, a collection of microgames about the trans experience. It uses written language and (meaningfully crude) visual art to set up the  <em>plot</em> , but interaction to tell the  <em>story</em> .</p>
<p>Something I'm very interested in seeing (and have made a few attempts at myself, but nothing worth sharing) is an attempt to create a fully-usable programming environment  <em>presented as a game</em>  specifically for the purpose of communicating ideas about programming. There've been plenty of the inverse, where a programming system is the setting within which a game takes place (see all the works of <a href="http://zachtronics.com">Zachtronics</a>, for instance), but I haven't seen anyone do a game as the setting within which actual programming takes place. Closest to that might be something like Minecraft or Dreams (etc), but I don't think those were designed to communicate ideas about programming the way, say, The Witness was designed to communicate a philosophy of science.</p>
<p>Another close comparison might be Advent of Code, where you playfully approach programming differently than in your normal work. The programming you do for AoC should feel meaningfully different. Similarly, imagine building your own Rosetta Code from scratch. That should give you a really particular feeling. I think it's related to, say, the feeling of writing a rasterizer for the dozenth time. I think these feelings are ideas, and that there's a whole language of them, and that the language is expressed through the creation of systems. I think if we studied this language, it would guide us toward building different kinds of tools.</p>
<p>And hell, you might eventually be able to write a paper about that. (Countdown to someone arguing that this is what Christopher Alexander has made a career of, in a sense.) But I don't think we will arrive at those system-feeling ideas in any way other than by building and playing with systems, and with a particular intention at that.</p>

<p>Heya internetpeoples ❤ I’ve spent a long time refining this and brought in “The LLMs” to help craft the tone here, and I think I’ve finally gotten it to a point where I feel like it hits my message and question, and doesn’t assume too much negativity or… doomcalling, heh. Thanks for the time and shared space, as always.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’ve despaired when stuck on problems I just couldn’t crack. I’ve also felt the joy of those “aha!” moments when things finally click. We’ve all been there as coders. While documentation and searches can help fill gaps, little replaces another human sitting alongside, guiding with patience earned from experience. In those moments when someone more seasoned gave guidance, I felt hope renewed. How might we foster more of these vital human connections?</p>

<p><em>Knowledge flows when passion meets patience</em> . I’m grateful for the patient coders who “reached down” to guide me. Let’s discuss barriers hampering these relationships. Generalizations about certain groups being “unwilling” to help are counterproductive. However, empathetic mentorship remains scarce. How might we change incentives?</p>

<p>Truly supporting newcomers requires understanding their frustrations are valid. I want to open a thoughtful discussion on constructive ways we can keep improving in this regard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are always exceptions by those dedicated to lifting others up. But much room remains for improving access, channels and incentives for more direct peer sharing across experience levels. It’s on each of us to reflect on where we can have an impact.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I welcome reactions, shared experiences, and dialogue toward that aim. How might we strengthen coder communities through human connections? Where do you see the biggest opportunities? Together, I believe we can guide positive change.</p>

<p>I ran across <a href="https://cassette-lang.com/">Cassette</a>, a programming language today. I liked some of the stuff on the webpage and think it is interestingly aligned with the Future of Coding community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I made Cassette as a simple language for “playful programming”. Playful programming is writing something for the sake of writing it. It’s making a software 3D renderer or a GIF reader, even though better implementations of those already exist. It’s making generative art programs and drawing them with a pen plotter. Cassette itself is playful programming—there are certainly other scripting languages that may be better for personal projects like these, but this one is mine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Continuing,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In particular, I wanted Cassette to feel “essential”, where each aspect of the language reflects some fundamental aspect of computing</em> 
 (from a functional language perspective, at least). For example, I consider garbage collection, lexical scopes, and immutable types essential. The result is a little boring, but I hope it’s a good platform to play with other programming concepts.</p>

<p>Is anyone aware of any papers on LLM assisted code generation inside a visual programming environment? I've only seen one. I'm going to be doing some experiments later this month, and I don't really know the state of the art.</p>

<p>Context: Automat aims to be a general purpose visual shell - it's meant to control other apps &amp; pass their data around. It has a website at <a href="https://automat.org">automat.org</a>. The MVP version is going to record &amp; replay desktop macros. Last week I've pretty much finished the work on connections and now I'm working on the new  <em>timeline</em>  object! </p>

<p>It uses expression nodes, global variables and flow-variables to handle the calculations and state. In a bar-chart the output of the mechanism can be seen. In this example the target value is 100 , and when moving the input value slider, that value is used as a measurement and the algorithm brings the measurement to the wanted value (100). This process is visualised in the bar-chart.</p>
<p>When the speed of the flow is set to maximum (in the top left corner), the "program-counter"-animation is not shown and it runs as fast as it can in realtime. That helps for these kind of algorithms.</p>

<p>Hello! So after much obsession with Propagator Networks as discussed on this slack <a href="https://history.futureofcoding.org/?fromDate=2024-03-18&amp;toDate=2024-03-24&amp;channel=thinking-together&amp;filter=#2024-03-21T19:26:33.915Z">💬 #thinking-together@2024-03-21</a>, i decided to make a little propagator network simulator on top of tldraw.</p>
<p>In short: Propagator networks enabling bi-directional computation via independently operating nodes- in the gif you can see one for converting temperatures. Propagators (squares) listen to changing inputs, run code, and update connected outputs.</p>
<p>You can make your own <a href="https://t.co/nxVo5UAShy">here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Put your variables in circles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put your JS in squares (you can write a return or not)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draw arrows from circles to squares with text that matches the variables</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draw arrows from squares to the circles to be updated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There's lot of awesome stuff than can be made with these (maybe everything?). If you want to have fun with it, try to make a conditional or a switch. Its fun 🙂</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>This is one of those questions where I don’t really know yet how to ask it, so let me fumble and handwave a little bit and see where this goes:</p>
<p>In computing history we went from printers to screens, and on those screens from a brief stint with vector graphics to bitmap displays, and on those bitmap displays from text mode to frame buffer, and in those frame buffers from sprites and blitting to rasterization and compositing. In the early days, when there wasn’t enough RAM for a full-screen bitmap frame buffer, character glyphs and sprites were brought in from ROM. Now we have so much memory that we have double-/triple-buffering and realtime compositing of separately stored textures that often exceed the number of screen pixels available by an order of magnitude or more.</p>
<p>I’m particularly interested in the early transition to raster graphics. At some point (and I assume that was probably with PostScript?) it became feasible to compute graphics on the fly instead of having them prepared as bitmaps in ROM or on disk. If I remember this correctly, PostScript was invented because due to the different font sizes it was more economical to ship instructions to generate glyphs on the fly on the printer than to ship all possible glyphs as bitmaps in all the different font sizes.</p>
<p>In a way we went from a “final” representation of a map of bits restricted to a certain grid size to an “intermediate” representation of instructions that have to be executed to generate the final map of bits in the desired size. Alternatively, we could see that as swapping space (memory) for time (compute).</p>
<p>Are you aware of any papers or other material that compares both sides of this transition?</p>
<p>For instance in terms of performance in space and time, ie. how much compute is needed for how much memory saved. Or in the broader sense of how we settled on certain graphics primitives, because they were cheap enough to implement in terms of compute, and how we settled on certain data formats, because they were small enough in terms of memory usage, so that this trade-off made sense.</p>

<p>It's not enough for a tool to solve your problem for you to use that tool. You have to also A) recognize the problem you have is solvable, B) recognize the tool can solve it, and C) be reasonably confident that you 
 <em>personally</em> can solve the problem with the tool. You need knowledge, skill, and the right mentality. Even programmers, who  <em>already have that mentality</em>, don't automatically generalize it to all applicable domains. Otherwise we'd be doing a lot more with our phones.</p>
<p>It's unreasonable to expect the average person will use any NoCode to solve their problems, regardless of how easy the tools are. This leaves the people for whom it provides economic value, which is why all modern NoCode tools are oriented towards business.</p>

<p>Hi friends! As part of my unending pursuit of creating The Best Programming Language, I've ended up building a structured editor / literate programming environment for creating self-hosted languages ... and that has turned into "An Interactive Tutorial about Compilers &amp; Type Inference", that includes interactive implementations of the papers "Algorithm W Step by Step" and "Typing Haskell in Haskell" (with more planned). I'm currently looking for beta testers to look it over before I make a general release, and I imagine there are many people here with relevant experience 😄.</p>
<p>So if any of y'all are interested, send me a message! As a teaser, here's the start of the intro document:</p>

<p>Got to a major milestone in v2 development for §Blawx, this week.

<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1787851368528576829">this tweet</a> , Simon Wardley compares making software systems explainable via moldable development (my expansion of his reference to Glamorous Toolkit) to creating maps. That sounds like a very useful metaphor to me. Many of us are interested in or even working on visual coding tools, and I wonder what their take on this metaphor is. Maps are inherently visual, but they are not the territory, i.e. the code with all the details. To me, visual tools are obviously the right choice for creating maps, but I remain unconvinced about their appropriateness for code.</p>
<p>I am thinking in particular of <a href="https://twitter.com/OrionReedOne">Orion Reed</a>’s recent demo of infinite canvasses as user interfaces. For making multi-faceted maps to software systems, that looks like a very appopriate representation.</p>

<p>Loose set of thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>could you make a type system that somehow captures all information possible about every value in a codebase? Like where the following is true: if typeof(a) === number, then typeof(a + 1 + 2) === number+3 !== typeof(a) …</li>
<li>I might want to “pin” and “unpin” my types - e.g. before refactoring a function, to “pin” its return type. If I had a more powerful type system like described in part one, I wouldn’t want to have to write out the whole type, I would want to just say “pin this such that whatever changes I make could not possibly effect the outcome of the function for any input, or else give me errors describing exactly what part of the input space no longer maps logically the same to the output space”</li>
<li>Another way to think of this might be to say, rather than writing tests, to be able to say “assume infinite test coverage of this codebase (and all tests are passing), now let me refactor things”.</li>
<li>I have no idea how this would work, but it makes me think of getting fractions into “simplest form”. Maybe you could get two functions into “simplest form” to test their similarity?</li>
</ul>
<p>I wonder if anything like that exists, or if this is gesturing at some existing area of research?</p>

<p>What I’ve concluded, based on experience, is that positioning your project as an alternative implementation of something is a losing proposition. It doesn’t matter how smart you are. It doesn’t matter how hard you work. The problem is, when you build an alternative implementation, you’ve made yourself subject to the whims of the canonical implementation. They have control over the direction of the project, and all you can do is try to keep up.</p>

<p>We are humans and might as well get used to it. So far, remotely done power and glory—as via government, big business, formal education, church—has succeeded to the point where gross profits obscure actual loss. In response to this dilemma and to these losses a realm of intimate, community power is developing—power of communities to conduct their own education, find their own inspiration, shape their own environment, and share their knowledge with others. Practices that aid this process are sought and promoted by the DAMAGED EARTH CATALOG.</p>

<p>With <em>Bend</em> 
 you can write parallel code for multi-core CPUs/GPUs without being a C/CUDA expert with 10 years of experience. It feels just like Python!
No need to deal with the complexity of concurrent programming: locks, mutexes, atomics... 
 <em>any</em>  work that can be done in parallel <em>will</em> be done in parallel.</p>

<p>There are some call-heavy agentic or personic processes that are going to get more feasible, like what Park did in "Human Simulacra." I'm hoping to use 4o or turbo to have a more structured step by step approach to code generation in domain specific visual languages.</p>

<p>What struck me when playing with it via the 'voice chat/conversation' thing, was a) how brilliant the voice recognition is, b) how brilliant the synthesised voice is, and c) how I was drawn into having a conversation with an AI.  I don't know if it's a use case, but what I can see happening is that more and more people are going to start treating the AI as a 'friend'.  I think that is quite sad, and will further isolate people from real life conversations, but I can also see how it will fill a need in some folks;  especially once the iPhone integration happens.</p>

<p>I've made some very nice UX improvements to the visual programming system that I am working on: it's now possible to replace a node with compatible node-types without hassle. When a node is selected, compatible node-types are shown in a dropdown. This helps especially when doing more creative work when creating a shader/gl flow for example and getting more feeling on what the impact is of certain mathematical operations (in the video <a href="https://youtu.be/K-956F6Vwps">youtu.be/K-956F6Vwps</a> I change a multiply node to an arctan calculation).</p>
<p>Another improvement is being able to insert a node into an existing connection.. also taking compatibility into account. This speeds up the creation process of flows in general.</p>
<p>Under the hood I've also made a nice improvement: I can now use jsx components using vanilla DOM without the use of react or other libraries. This is a nice DX improvement when developing my project.</p>

<p>Hello Future of Coding!</p>
<p>I'm looking for something which I would describe in the following way. There was a few years ago a article on hackernews where someone showed a kind of dynamic state transition visualization. One could setup multiple nodes and avalue flow from one node to the next but there would be also a flow back to the original node. So my question would be does anyone know what I refer to? What was the name of the diagram. I tried to search for dynamic state transition diagram but it is very scary how bad search engines are these days. So the Name of the diagram , the hackernews article or related reousces would be most welcome. Thank you 🙂</p>

<p>For the last month I've been working on an arrow toolkit for the web, called Quiver 🏹. It's exploring 3 problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if visual connection could be declaratively expressed in HTML? </li>
<li>What if there was a tiny toolkit that enabled all kinds of connection/arrows to be built? </li>
<li>How do we break arrows out from spatial canvases and enable them to used on any website?</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently I'm prototyping some pre-built arrows/connection: curved arrows, orthogonal edges, Xanadu links and hyperedges. But the library is also explicitly designed to be extensible so you can use your own layout algorithms or designs. Part of the extensibility means the ability to easily animate objects along the arrow (for all of those dataflow VPLs out there 😜) or add arbitrary labels/annotations to arrows.</p>
<p>Given that connection is probably one of the most commonly used relationships in visual programming systems, I'm curious if there are any other types of arrows or functionality you would find useful in your own projects? Its not published to NPM yet, but the repo is <a href="https://github.com/Little-Languages/quiver">here</a>.</p>

<p>I'm exploring strategies to enable scientists (biologists in pharma) without computational expertise be able to interact with big data more intuitively. My ultimate goal is to have users ask biological questions, and the system to generate and execute analytical workflows utilizing existing methods from the scientific domain to answer these questions with data visualizations,</p>
<p>I evaluated the non-interpretable and inaccurate "chat your data" LLM solutions. I'm currently thinking about the possibilities of developing/using a DSL as intermediary output prior to code generation to make the process more interpretable. I am also considering what would be the most efficient abstraction strategies of the analytical functionalities/libraries in certain biological domains to improve the accuracy of the outputs (of the higher level strategy and the actual code). I would love to brainstorm about these problems offline/online.

<p>I am once again looking at pages of notes I wrote three years ago attempting to find a way to declaratively diagram concurrent legal processes so as to illuminate the steps available to the parties as the process unfolds. I feel like I have something worth exploring, but to illustrate it I need a diagramming language that allows me to nest nodes inside of one another, and draw edges that originate and terminate at arbitrary depths of nodes. DOT won't let you draw an arrow starting at the edge of a subgraph, and doesn't have any way of nesting actual nodes, for example. Is anyone aware of a text-based graphing language that will let me nest objects and draw edges between arbitrary depths?</p>

<p>Here is an interesting 2.5D experiment for those who like the canvas approach. I'm pretty sure it could have some practical applications. <a href="https://twitter.com/OrionReedOne/status/1784871153787420920">2D canvases have a whole dimension spare....</a></p>

<p>I've been thinking about this tweet from John Carmack (who created Doom), and just generally about a future where AI does most of the coding and I'm managing AI - and... I hate it? It's not to say that I don't see this happening. There's a ton of capital flying around to make it happen, and I think end-users will inevitably gain the capability to build certain categories of simple, customised software.</p>
<p>But as someone who has deeply loved the practice of programming for more than a decade, the future that GitHub (who - in the midst of me writing this - launched Copilot Workspace), Devin, and the rest are painting seems to be leaving out so much of nuances that comes with building anything non-trivial. I absolutely love the idea of operating at a higher level of abstraction (just like how I enjoy writing modern programming languages compared to C or assembly) and getting my ideas/work out faster. But not spending my entire day just asking AI to do things or reviewing code all day - which makes me wonder: how do developers even get good at reviewing code if they aren't spending a ton of time writing code and problem solving? What's the right level of abstraction in this "promised future" that lets me get into the nuances of building software for anything non-trivial and continue problem solving in general? This is perhaps not even a question, and just a general thought I've been thinking a lot about.</p>

<p>I am looking around for tools / frameworks / UI patterns that are roughly of the shape "spreadsheet with editable computation pipeline". What do people know of that's in that category?</p>
<p>To clarify, I realise spreadsheets alone can achieve computation... but I am thinking more of projects where the computation is a bit more "visual" than just formulas in cells, perhaps like a nodes or blocks environment that then feeds into a table / spreadsheet to display data. <strong>@Paul Shen</strong>'s Natto is one such example of the kind of thing I am thinking of. There might be other ways to do this beyond just a series of nodes that feed into a table... I'm curious to see what else might be out there already. I wonder if there are projects in the data analysis / computational science spaces that might fit...?</p>
<p>Apologies if my question is too vague, I'm still trying to work out what I'm even looking for. 🙂</p>

    <p>Welcome! Starting this week I will expand the "Demos" section to include original content created by Future of Coding members.</p>
<p>The "From our Community" section will have content shared by members but that comes from "outside".  </p>
<p>But first things first, there's a <strong>new podcast episode</strong>, great topic and impressive production, check it out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Orca is typically encountered as an inky black and seafoam green alphabet soup, pulsating to some species of broody electronic industrial throb. But it is also a forgiving learning environment that doesn’t crash, puts code and data together in the same space, lets you directly manipulate code and data interchangeably, allows generous recovery from mistakes, and supports discovery through freeform play.</p>
<p>This is one of those "a very special episode" sort of things where.. it's going to be a bit different from the episodes I make for the forseeable future. Hope you enjoy it!</p>

<p>The future of code involves waiting for Copilots (Even though they get faster all the time, we'll just ask more and more of them).</p>
<p>We took a stab at visualizing the design decisions that our Copilot makes while it's coding the design you've prompted it for.</p>
<p>Instead of just spinners or the raw stream of text like chat UIs, we overlay this visualization where the design will appear on the canvas. Each visualization reflects a design variant that Copilot works on, and is computed in real-time based on the token streams from the LLM.</p>

<p>Ok, I've been thinking a lot about composable systems recently, and why I don't find visual programming languages like blueprints very flexible. Wrote up a blog post about it. Basically, I think the value graph is a more fundamental primitive for computation than execution graphs. <a href="https://johnaustin.io/articles/2024/composability-designing-a-visual-programming-language">Composability: Designing a Visual Programming Language</a></p>

<p>Does anyone else think of "configuring" as distinct from "programming"? Some activities I consider "configuring" and not "programming": much devops work such as Terraform, YML files for build pipelines, even commonly labeled "programming" of a VCR/DVR.</p>

<p>Random thought/question. I've noticed canvas based design tools have converged on a panel configuration of "Layers | Canvas | Properties | (and sometimes Timeline)"-- as opposed solving the underlying needs another way. Is this pattern the end-all-be-all? Or a local maxima? I tend to think the later.</p>

<p>This year I’m helping organize <a href="https://liveprog.org/">LIVE</a>, the Workshop on Live Programming. A lot of folk here in FoC are working on projects related to liveness… I encourage you to consider submitting your work!</p>
<p>(Here, “live programming” means “getting immediate feedback on the behavior of your program even while you’re programming it”. That includes “Learnable Programming”-style interfaces, spreadsheets, notebooks, REPL-y stuff, interfaces for live performances with code, many interfaces for making art with code...)</p>
<p>LIVE is an academic conference, but it’s attracted great work from people both in and outside the academy. Submitting a project to LIVE might be an opportunity to communicate about your work in a new way and get thoughtful feedback on it from a new community. (We have some tips for non-academics in our <a href="https://liveprog.org/#faq">FAQ</a>.)</p>
<p>The submission deadline is  <em>July 7</em> . The workshop will be some day TBD  <em>October 20-25, 2024 in Los Angeles</em> .</p>
<p>Feel free to DM me if you have questions or concerns; I’d be excited to help out. 🙏</p>

It’s not an autocomplete or a copilot. It’s a real AI developer that does all the coding while scientists give it feedback.

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/3vINEOECt9w">In this video</a> I show a small celsius to fahrenheit converter (this is one of the tasks from 7Gui) that I build using my visual programming system and extended it where needed.</p>
<p>The solution uses an observe-variable node-type which triggers a flow when a variable gets set. I've also build a new user-input node with decimal formatting option (in the near future I will extend this to be configurable forms for collecting user-input).</p>
<p>You can see what happens as you type in the celsius or fahrenheit temperature in the input fields (you see the data flowing though the flow). To prevent an infinite loop, the flow-engine uses a call-stack which stops running when a node gets run twice.</p>
<p>I am still thinking of different solutions but for now this works (some nodes gets run unneeded, I think this can be optimized). Per node-call the node-id, scope-id and input port-name is stored on the call-stack, this is needed to keep other things working like the recursive functions in the quicksort example.</p>

<p>Has anyone done any work with the memory design from the human simulacrum paper by Joon Sung Park? Saw a presentation last week at Stanford, the boss is having me experiment with his code base. Would like to exchange notes.</p>

<p>I've been improving the timeline-slider in my visual programming system code-flow-canvas.. you can try it out here : <a href="https://demo.codeflowcanvas.io">demo.codeflowcanvas.io</a> (best experience is on desktop since the mobile and touch responsiveness is still lacking). </p>
<p>Additionally the state-machine node now also shows its transitions when executing a flow or using the timeline slider. </p>
<p>Also some the nodes that are used to visualize data have been connected to the flow-execution history. Some changes were needed in keeping track of state and updating nodes visually when using the timeline slider. </p>
<p>In this video I <a href="https://youtu.be/ElNTPWdWfFQ">show some of the examples together with the timeline slider here</a></p>

<p>I've started building an "everything shell". It uses my language EYG and a structural editor. the whole thing is be hosted with the idea that the resources you can ask about (instead of filesystems and processes) are every cloud system I have.</p>

<p>“It’s a Unix system… I know this!”</p>
<p>Something from a year or two ago that I built and iterated on since then. Ever wanted to see all your files in 3D to get a mental map? No problem - use  <code>CherrierView</code>  - a terminal-style, colorized  <code>.dae</code>  blit of arbitrary directories into space.</p>

<p>I've been playing with a new platform that I hope will be quite convivial. Hosted 😬 but no Javascript and seems easy to build and self-host. Created by a single person, so decent chance of staying simple over time. It seems to be a fork of emscripten that's been made habitable. In particular, it includes raylib and some Lua bindings to it, so I'm starting to feel at home.</p>

<p>I ported one of my early LÖVE apps to it, for geometric constructions. There's an app store and I've published my app there, so you should be able to run it for yourself and inspect the source code. (All apps on the app store are available right in the file system, under  <code>/usr/store</code> !)</p>
<p>Disclaimers. It's slow, like dialing up over a phone line. Still lots of bugs. I had to reboot the VM several times while recording this video. Commands often hang or crash, then completely stop working until I reload. It's never lost my data, though. Data is stored in local storage on the browser until you publish something to the app store.</p>

<p>I'm thinking about spreadsheets. Has anyone ever made a convincing interface for  <em>defining functions</em> , using a spreadsheet interface?</p>
<p>(I am aware that you can define functions in most modern spreadsheets, but this requires you to go to a traditional coding interface. This is obviously cheating!)</p>

<p>Hi FoC Community 🙂  I'm looking for something that i found a couple of years ago and apparently my fuzzy descriptions fail my zettelkasten or a search engine for that matter. I think I'm looking for a clojure talk in which someone presented also a tool. This tool used a UI of 2 or Three circles as a kind of number REPL which explained for example how the map function works in clojure. I hope that isn'T too vague if you know the name of the tool, that would be very cool. Thank you!!</p>

<p>I wrote a blog post about constant data in PL. Which is kind of curious in text based PL and a place where more visual approaches can really shine. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>All of the programming languages I know make an interesting distinction, between two groups of constants, depending on type.</p>

<p>I’ve been reviewing classic papers about simplicity, complexity, and adjacent topics, both for my current series of essays and an essay I’m writing for Onward!</p>
<p>So far I have reviewed (or downloaded for review):</p>
<ul>
<li>Herbert A. Simon, The Architecture of Complexity (1962)</li>
<li>Melvin E. Conway, How Do Committees Invent? (1968)</li>
<li>Peter Naur, Programming as Theory Building (1985)</li>
<li>Frederick P. Brooks, Jr., No Silver Bullet — Essence and Accident in Software Engineering (1986)</li>
<li>Richard P. Gabriel, Worse is Better (1991)</li>
<li>Rich Hickey, Simple Made Easy (2011)</li>
</ul>
<p>What am I missing? What else should be on that list?</p>

<p>Hi all, I've been inactive here for a long time. Progress on my big project, a collaborative mobile-friendly development environment, has been very slow. However, along the way I've built some libraries which may be of interest to some people here.</p>
<p>On the languages and parsing side, I've built <a href="https://github.com/jhp/recursive-grammar-literal">recursive grammar literals</a> which lets you write CFGs as normal javascript functions. And <a href="https://github.com/jhp/church-cat">church-cat</a> which lets you compute over a tree structure, e.g. annotate a parse tree.</p>
<p>On the UI side I've built <a href="https://github.com/jhp/imperative">imperative</a> which is a frontend javascript library much like React, but based on generators and structured concurrency. And most recently I've been working on <a href="https://github.com/jhp/palimpsest">Palimpsest</a> which covers the backend of web development with a more functional or "event-sourced" style where data sources are computed as folds over input streams. My interest there is to allow stateful applications to be more easily shared, forked, and extended by their users etc.</p>

<p>We just published a new demo of Plato's PBD subsystem. Much more powerful than our previous implementation.</p>
<p>PBD is historically difficult to generalize and make practical, but it seems that once you take it out of the desktop metaphor and apply it to relational data where queries are more explicit, it does quite well.</p>
<p>I suspect this could become the most prevalent way of automating app logic without coding.</p>

<p>Hi All</p>
<p>I’m almost “done” with my VR visual/spatial programming app, Pebble Graphics 🎉 (“done” because I still see a lot of things that could be improved, but there are other projects I’m excited to start so I’m shipping what I have). It’s a VR version of turtle graphics with some interactive program stepping and 3D visualizations of things like state change and execution history.</p>
<p>I made a trailer you can watch (and listen to 🎶) here <a href="https://youtu.be/Fl3DjzTdUo8?si=bWi7CWwbXIQh_wUw">Pebble Graphics Trailer</a>. If you have a Quest headset and want to try it out, I set up a Beta release while I try to get it into Meta’s App Lab app store. This link <a href="https://www.meta.com/s/2Rlda8ess">meta.com/s/2Rlda8ess</a> should work otherwise feel free to DM me the email address associated with your Oculus/Meta account.</p>
<p>I also have some time-stamped/annotated videos later on in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhmEEtPzG7mW4JrBUhwbo3al6HjaJsDp2">Youtube Playlist</a> in case you want to see more.</p>
<p>I’m more of a lurker in this slack, but it’s a community I enjoy checking on and it’s really cool to see it grow!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pebble Graphics is a 3D visual and interactive programming system that lets you create and explore geometric patterns in virtual reality. Using simple commands, you can control Pebbles the dog to draw lines and shapes with programming. You can also step through your programs interactively, and see unique 3D visualizations of how things change over time. Pebble Graphics is a fun and creative way to learn basic ideas in programming.</p>

<p>Last year I used the advent of code to test the visual programming environment that I was building at that time.. and it helped me to come to the conclusion to start over.. which I did at the beginning of this year. So... the time has come to test my new environment and let advent of code help me improve and extend it. Hopefully this year I won't need to decide to start over😅. To finish the first challenge I needed to extend my vps with new node types or tweak some other stuff like be able to execute regex expressions and load external files as input to a flow. For the second part of day 1 a special node needed to be created to handle the sneaky replace string functionality that was needed. A very nice update that I made is the possibility to run parts of flow in parallel instead of sequential and use the results in the upstream nodes. </p>
<p>And talking about upstream nodes... since last week it's also possible to drag all upstream or downstream nodes at once when reorganizing a flow using UI elements(it can be seen in the video). </p>
<p>In the flow-engine I also use standalone nodes that represent global variables which can be used in other nodes. </p>
<p>I'll definitely not make it to the AoC leaderboard (it's not a goal anyway).. however.. I think I am getting a lot of value out of this already..even on day 1.</p>

<p>Been making slow, but steady progress on my editor. I can properly zoom in and out on the canvas. I can have some panes that represent sub-file things. The power usage when idle is basically non-existent (down from 100% cpu usage always). I finally feel like things are starting to come together and that I can finish up some parts and then really start focusing on actually making the flow and features fit how I code.</p>
<p>Hopefully soon I can start using it for a project that isn't coding itself so I am forced to add all the features I've been ignoring.</p>

<p>Where's the emacs people in this text centric brave new world?</p>
<p>Context:  the most interesting stuff done on text always happened on emacs, and it makes sense to use a text centric malleable software platform to experiment by adding LLMs to everything, I haven't seen much done there.</p>

<p>I've demoed my Kopi language and Rect-Desktop projects a few weeks ago. In my experience writing Kopi, I've always wanted to write a "How to Write a Programming Language" tutorial based on it, since the core language is simple and familiar (infix operators, assignment, anonymous functions, etc.).

<p>Followup on my  <code>~_*Colorful types*_~</code>  project. I’m trying to create a  <code>~_*map*_~</code>  for a codebase with different zoom levels.</p>
<p>I have been thinking about having 3 zoom levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1: Only colors for both types &amp; functions</li>
<li>Level 2: Colors and names for types, functions and parameters</li>
<li>Level 3: Shows the entire source file (maybe with some extra color sugar on top?) </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a couple of screenshots of level 1 &amp; 2, and video of the WIP interface.</p>
<p>PS. Anyone have good recommendations of typescript codebases with a couple dozen source code files which I can use for testing?</p>

<p>More progress on a lightweight programming environment that runs on Linux, Windows, Mac, Android, iOS. Also modifiable live while it runs (though not on mobile devices).</p>
<p>The seed design constraint here was to structurally prevent the pop-up keyboard on a touchscreen from ever blocking my typing. That led to this design of a multi-line commandline editor in the top half, fixing the non-editable output buffer in the bottom half. Independent commands/scripts then expanded in the only other direction available: left/right.</p>

<p>Hi, in this weeks video I show a new node type in which a prompt can be entered which is used to create HTML via openai gpt4. It's quite powerful .. the created nodes can receive and visualize input data from another node. This is offcourse inspired by makeitreal from tldraw which uses gpt4-vision-preview. I have been playing with the prompt to get the result that I wanted, although the results are not consistent when recreating the html using the same prompt. Still, very cool that this is possible.</p>

<p>Achievement unlocked: I've built an app large enough[1] that it crashes my programming environment that puts all the code on a spatial surface.</p>
<p>The problem: I do this snazzy initial animation (see video) that takes in the whole thing before zooming back in somewhere. That animation works by drawing the whole surface to an in-memory canvas before transforming it. Turns out drawing to a canvas still uses the video card, and I don't have enough video RAM for a virtual "monitor" of this resolution.</p>
<p>[1] Or spread out enough. It's not really about lines of code, just how much area the code occupies.</p>

<p>I was leafing through my father's old books when this diagram caught me off-guard.</p>
<p>We're so used now to having an OS with apps, that it's weird to think of OS-level transitions (login-&gt;shell), inter-apps transitions (shell-&gt;vi) and inside-app transitions (vi's command&lt;-&gt;append modes) as similar things. 🙃</p>
<p>But to a user new to computers, yes these are all "modes".</p>

<p>I think that often the most difficult part of programming is debugging: humans aren't very good at "seeing" how an app operated when it failed. You get some log output that might or might not have references to the correct file locations.</p>
<p>I don't see any reason, in the long term, why humans would be better than machines at debugging. How to make that happen? I assume somebody is building this already. Would it help if an AI with a large context window + access to the VM could see the whole call logs/tree and see exactly what is going on?  AI could learn from other users, see everything that happens in a run without debugger/console.logs, try multiple solutions in parallel, and fix issues while you sleep.</p>
<p>Thoughts on this?</p>

<p>Ink &amp; Switch just released a new essay: <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/embark/">Embark — Dynamic documents for making plans</a>.</p>
<p>Starting from a desire to "unbundle the app" in the name of malleable software, they explore using a bullet-point outliner as a substrate for dynamic properties, computations, and views. They ground the work with a specific use case — trip planning — and they hard-code a bunch of stuff that ought to be pushed into user space, granted. But it's easy to look at this, imagine how it could be expanded, and see some really compelling possibilities for a different way to approach creating and distributing software.</p>

<p>The subject of this episode’s paper — <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/propositions-as-types/propositions-as-types.pdf">Propositions as Types</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Wadler">Philip Wadler</a> — is one of those grand ideas that makes you want to go stargazing. To stare out into space and just disassociate from your body and become one with the heavens.  <em>Everything — life, space, time, existence — all of it is a joke!</em>  A cosmic ribbing delivered by the laws of the universe or some higher power or, perhaps, higher order. Humanity waited two thousand years, from the time of the ancient Greeks through until the 1930s, for a means to answer questions of calculability, when three suddenly arrived all at once:</p>
<ul>
<li>General recursive functions by Gödel in 1934, with functions of sets of natural numbers.</li>
<li>Lambda calculus by Alonzo Church in 1936, with anonymous single-variable functions.</li>
<li>Turing machines by Alan Turing in 1937, with a process for evaluating symbols on a tape.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then it was discovered that these three models of computation were, in fact, perfectly equivalent. That any statement made in one could be made in the others. A striking coincidence, sure, but not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_discovery">without precedent</a>. But  <em>then</em>  it was quietly determined (in 1934, again in 1969, and finally published in 1980) that computation itself is in a direct correspondence with logic. That every proposition in a given logic corresponds with a type in a given programming language, every proof corresponds with a program, and the simplification of the proof corresponds with the evaluation of the program.</p>
<p>The implications boggle the mind.  <em>How could this be so?</em>  Well, how could it be any other way? Why did it take so long to discover? What other discoveries like this are perched on the precipice of revelation?</p>
<p>Philip Wadler is here to walk us through this bit of history, suggest answers to some of these questions, and point us in a direction to search for more.</p>
<p>And  <em>we</em>  are here, dear listener, to level with you that a lot of this stuff is miserably hard to approach, presented with the symbols and language of formal logic that is so often inscrutable to outsiders. By walking you through Wadler’s paper (and the much more approachable <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOiZatlZtGU">Strange Loop talk</a>), and tying it in with the cultural context of modern functional programming, we hope you’ll gain an appreciation for this remarkable, divine  <em>pun</em>  that sits beneath all of computation.</p>

<p>I seem to have renewed my collaboration for a tablet-friendly programming environment. For the <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=94852">current version</a>, my partner led and pushed for preserving LÖVE primitives. For example, the LÖVE event loop calls functions you define called  <code>love.draw</code> ,  <code>love.keypressed</code> , etc., and it seems desirable to continue to support those for familiarity's sake. This can seem impossible if the environment is also built in LÖVE and uses those same functions for providing its infrastructure, but since Lua is a dynamic environment there are tricks to make it work reasonably nicely.</p>
<p>Lately I've been taking the lead on a riff of that project, and I find I'm advocating strongly to  <em>not</em>  do this. I want to define new handlers like  <code>shell.draw</code>  and  <code>shell.keypressed</code>  that programs within my environment will have to call. And I finally figured out why I feel so strongly about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>LÖVE has a function to return the bounds of the device/window. You typically can draw between x coordinates 0 and some width. And this information is often used to draw UI elements near the edges and corners. So should we now override functions like  <code>line</code>  to adjust coordinates and keep them in the client area? There's a lot of surface area to cover here. Bugs will inevitably happen, and when they do our attempts to create a seamless abstraction will cause more confusion.</li>
<li>Ranting more broadly, the desire for a "seamless experience" is a disease. The provider wants to "own the customer relationship," so that the user can forget there's anything in the universe but themselves and the app. Just like a casino. I'd rather not pretend we can wish the universe away with its possibility of errors. Let's me and the user treat each other as grown-ups, and not hide irreducible complexity in our supply chains. Here are the functions I provide, here are the functions LÖVE provides. I recommend you use my stuff where possible, but you don't have to. Yes, it's confusing. Welcome.</li>

<p>Hi, since I've started building visual programming systems, I have always used a push-based approach where a node triggers another node that follows it. This is much inspired by flow based programming. But since I want to build a generic visual programming system, I think that it is also important to support different ways.. basic statecharts I already support, but a pull-based system is not yet something that I had build with my system. Until now! .. so in this video you can see how I construct a flow that is used to construct a glsl fragment shader. Here the output node pulls in the data from the node's cominh before it in the flow, so working backwards through a flow. </p>
<p>Although it's not my goal to build a full product around this alone.. a lot better and much more extensive applications already exist for building shaders this way. But still helpful to look at my project from a different perspective, which leads to some refactoring, bug fixing, insights and inspiration.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was really in doubt if this was the right route for this week's time spent on my project because of the awesome demo that tldraw made with gpt4-vision api, very cool! So,I also had to play with it together with my own application and was also amazed with the possibilities! Probably my next video will have this as a topic. Anyway, for now, enjoy my short video where I construct a very simple shader which runs on the GPU via webgl.</p>

<p>I built a Magic Inky interface at work a while back. A metadata editor that presented as a nested bulleted list of English sentences with clickable words, like:</p>
<p>“From [time T1] to [time T2], an [event type] happens with [property P], and it’s very [adjective].”</p>
<p>The event descriptions are highly multi-dimensional and resonate well with this information design, though the timestamps suffer a bit. They want to be on a timeline, but I didn’t have the budget. Despite this, the UI has saved us loads of time and people  ~<em><em>love</em></em>~  the sentence-based configuration compared to the forty-column table of dropdowns they envisioned when I started the project.</p>
<p>The biggest failure was that enforcing a few global constraints was  ~<em><em>also</em></em>~  outside my budget. Lacking those has led to data loss—never more than a few minute’s worth, but still. I felt bad. Thankfully, someone else recently picked up the project and will be correcting those omissions.</p>
<p>But we disagreed immediately on how to do it! I thought we should  ~<em><em>present</em></em>~  the errors: “These events overlap!” The other person thought we should make the errors impossible: when you edit a timestamp, you implicitly edit all the others that are involved in the constraint.</p>
<p>I generally agree with their approach. I mean, it’s baked into the rest of the UI. When you change an event type, it changes the rest of the sentence. But if you change the type back, the sentence structure is restored and your previous values all come back. Cascading edits are more destructive than that. They force you to be careful about what you change and to be observant of unintended side-effects.</p>
<p>The block editor problem of representing invalid states is another way to look at it. Sometimes the most efficient path between two valid states passes through an invalid one. If you want to reorder two events, for example, a first step might be to copy the start and end times from one to the other, as part of an “a = b; b = oldA” sequence. They overlap until you’re done. To do the same without ever breaking global constraints requires user ingenuity or a more featureful editor with a “swap events” button. Requiring user ingenuity wastes a lot of time and energy and happiness over the lifetime of the UI, but observing users and adding features to address every desired editing operation takes a lot of dev time too, and it has to happen  ~<em><em>now</em></em>~ , or else people editing this data will be blocked whenever they find an impossible edit.</p>
<p>Anyway, not too many answers here, but I thought it was an interesting case study, with thought-provoking  ~<em><em>questions</em></em>~  at least!</p>

<p>An idea is starting to form for me around prototype-based modeling being a good metaphor for programming effectively with LLMs. Essentially you can provide an example of a patttern/component/class/etc and have it return a version of it modified in specific ways, which can then be used as a prototype for future generations/instantiations.</p>
<p>A version of this idea can be seen <a href="https://twitter.com/mrmkrs/status/1725959207365583196">here with tldraw</a> where he generates the next more specific interface step off the previous one.</p>
<p>Another I'm kind of using this in my agent framework: <a href="https://github.com/sublayerapp/sublayer/blob/main/lib/sublayer/agents/generate_sublayer_agent_agent.rb">generate_sublayer_agent_agent.rb</a> where we generate new agents based off a simple agent template (and works surprisingly well).</p>
<p>I know Hofstatder digs into this concept in GEB and Steve Yegge calls it the <a href="https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/10/universal-design-pattern.html">Universal Design Pattern</a></p>
<p>Does this resonate with anyone here? Is anyone familiar with any other writing about prototype-based modeling/prototypal inheritance/etc for me to take this further?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.applevis.com/forum/app-development-programming/work-progress-vosh-third-party-screen-reader-macintosh">I’m excited to see where this 3rd party screen-reader for macOS goes.</a> On windows there are 2 first-in-class options available outside of the OS, JAWS and NVDA. On macOS there is only the system provided VoiceOver.</p>
<p>I think VoiceOver is a pretty solid competitor to NVDA, but, it is very very very opinionated, and makes some unusual choices. I think this has a knock on effect where, since VoiceOver is the easiest screen-reader for most web devs to reach for, a lot of implementations end up being hyper-focused on supporting VoiceOver’s specific flavor of handling the accessibility tree. Having more diversity in the space, I think could hopefully mitigate this. While this isn’t directly related to the future of coding as we normally talk about it here, I think projects like this are just the sort of thing that can help to shape things for years to come.</p>

<p>“shouldn’t this have been published a few months ago?” yeah, probably. I even considered submitting it to the AoC contest. time is a real beast.
The title is clickbait. I did not design and implement a programming language for the sole or even primary purpose of leaderboarding on Advent of Code. It just turned out that the programming language I was working on fit the task remarkably well.
I can’t name just a single reason I started work on my language, Noulith, back in July 2022, but I think the biggest one was even more absurdly niche: I solve and write a lot of puzzlehunts, and I wanted a better programming language to use to search word lists for words satisfying unusual constraints, such as, “Find all ten-letter words that contain each of the letters A, B, and C exactly once and that have the ninth letter K.”1 I have a folder of ten-line scripts of this kind, mostly Python, and I thought there was surely a better way to do this. Not necessarily faster — there is obviously no way I could save time on net by optimizing this process. But, for example, I wanted to be able to easily share these programs such that others could run them. I had a positive experience in this with my slightly older golflang Paradoc, which I had compiled into a WASM blob and put online and, just once, experienced the convenience of sharing a short text processing program through a link. (Puzzle: what does this program do?) I also wanted to write and run these programs while booted into a different operating system, using a different computer, or just on my phone.

<p>Does anyone know of any systems that let you take the output value on a repl, edit it, and then edit the code so that your edit is true?</p>

<p>What are some examples of successful UIs over constraint solving systems?</p>
<p>I'm about to do a bit of research on this topic but thought I'd start here.</p>
<p>Off the dome I can think of excel (numerical constraints) and rhino grasshopper (architectural / physical constraints).</p>
<p>I realize this is vague, but what I have in mind is a UI that allows for constraints to be defined which are then composed together and solved behind the scenes.</p>
<p>In particular, I'm wondering how to represent the case where there are multiple valid solutions and offer cycling through them to the user.</p>

<p>I'm thinking about ways to represent/interact with a (computational) graph. I could come up with three different interfaces off the top of my head: 1) names/identifiers and application, 2) combinators/stack operations, and 3) boxes and wires. I'm curious to know if y'all can think of any other?</p>

<p>Hey everyone -- long-time lurker, first time poster. Thrilled to share the open beta launch of MightyMeld, a visual dev tool for React I've been building with some friends of mine. <a href="https://www.mightymeld.com/">mightymeld.com</a></p>
<p>Just posted this blog post telling the story and why I'm excited -- <a href="https://mightymeld.com/blog/open-beta">mightymeld.com/blog/open-beta</a></p>
<p>Would love to hear your thoughts! I'm a former academic who's been driven into industry out of a desire to make the theoretical practical. MightyMeld is a "visual coding" that is not like any kind of "visual coding" i would've imagined if we hadn't've built this thing starting from real production code and saying "how can we make this more visual".</p>

<p>I’m developing a cutting-edge tool that leverages ChatGPT to ghost-write prose based on my point-form outlines, particularly focusing on ‘new ideas’ that the AI wasn’t trained on. The challenge lies in preventing hallucinations and incorrect extrapolations from the outline. Early experimental results have been promising prompting me to create a dedicated workflow tool. This tool enables me to swiftly input point-form outlines, using the user-friendly Kinopio platform for brainstorming. I then paste the outline to ChatGPT, transforming it into coherent and readable prose. Join me in revolutionizing idea development and content creation with this innovative solution! [ChatGPT]</p>

<p>Hi, the last month I've been focussing a lot on fixing some bugs in the way nodes are connected and improving the different path types that are used.</p>
<p>This small demo video <a href="https://youtu.be/cnD-AlDQJDk">(Creating new flow using a "back-loop" and placing the "back-loop" connection on a separate layer)</a> shows creating a very small flow from scratch, the functionality of the flow is not important here.. but the thing I wanted to show is the way a "backloop" is created. The system uses a different svg path for backloops: normal nodes are connected using a bezier curve but when the output node is placed before the start node, the path changes to a "back-loop". </p>
<p>Another thing to notice is the layering.. the back-loop is placed on its own layer, hopefully keeping bigger flows more clear. You can toggle which layer is in front. </p>

<p>Hey folks! I'm doing some research into code formatters/pretty printers, with a view to potentially building my own. Does any one have any examples of code formatters that they've found especially fast, or that they know of which have a special focus on performance?</p>

<p>Over the years, I've thought about different ways of creating an interactive tutorial about writing a simple programming language. For example, you can create a "wizard" style with next and back buttons, or you can create one single page with the code floating on the right side of the content (possibly sticky). One detail is that each example would grow in size (for the complete code), but would only focus on one sub-section. I thought about collapsing sections already covered, but being able to expand them, or just have a single button to expand all the hidden code. Has anyone had experience or have seen articles that use a "build from small to large", showing code along the way?</p>

<p>I’ve been working on a tool to get a high level view of an entire typescript codebase to help me understand/navigate it.</p>
<p>It shows all the functions and interfaces. Every  <code>interface</code>  is represented by a color, and the signature of a function is shown with these colors.</p>
<p>I need some help with a better algorithm to transform the name of the  <code>type</code>  into to a color. e.g. the type  <code>string</code>  -&gt; blue,  <code>int</code>  -&gt; green, etc.</p>
<p>The problem is that I’m not sure what I want the output to be, how should the color space be distributed? how should colors be clustered?</p>
<p>I think I can copy what code editors use for  <code>semantic highlighting</code> , but I haven’t been able to find an implementation of it.</p>
<p>Does anyone have ideas on what I should search for?</p>
<p>Happy to explain more, if it’s not clear.</p>
<p>PS. Here is how a codebase currently looks. White rectangles are files, interfaces are shown on the top, and functions on the bottom</p>

I spontaneously decided to project your example to an ALD mockup to get a bit of a feeling for inhowfar ALDs are compatible with your code projection focused of concatenative code.
Seems pretty good.</p>
<p>★ One nice thing with ALDs is that library functions are threated exactly the same as argument values. They come in as semi-implicit arguments via the grey collection abstraction-line.
★ One annoying (but I think good) restriction of ALD is that functions (and definitions in let sections) can only ever have just one single value-line as their final output (except one cheats a bit as I've done here with memocurry :smiling_imp:).</p>

<p><em>Replacing authentication with visual identity</em> </p>
<p>Background: I'm starting to think about building a new forum. Given <a href="https://akkartik.name/freewheeling/">my past</a>, it won't surprise anyone that I mean to do this outside the morass of non-convivial software that is the modern web browser. My broad plan is:</p>
<ul>
<li>LÖVE v12 will support https, and <a href="https://github.com/love2d/love/actions">release candidates</a> are already quite stable. Good enough to start building on.</li>
<li>I'll build my forum out of a server-side API in Lua and a client in LÖVE v12. (Should be easy to support Windows, Linux, BSD and Android. Mac and iOS will require some annual contortions to build LÖVE for oneself.)</li>
<li>The server side will of course be open source just like the client. In addition, all post/comment data will be published to a git repo on something like a daily basis.</li>
</ul>
<p>The one major open question concerns authentication. How can we have stable identity? The above architecture is intended to allow anyone to host the forum (without trying to build galaxy-brain merkle trees, federated protocols or CRDTs), and I would prefer to not take a position of power as the source of everyone's hashed passwords (an intrinsically centralizing architecture).</p>
<p>A few months ago someone showed me this ancient essay called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091126092028/http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2009/3/12/33338/3000">"attacked from within"</a>, and I find myself thinking about it often. The whole thing is worth reading, but for this thread the crucial list of bullets halfway down is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Registration keeps out good posters.</li>
<li>Registration lets in bad posters.</li>
<li>Registration attracts trolls.</li>
<li>Anonymity counters vanity.</li>
</ul>
<p>A provocative worldview that seems at least worth exploring. Keeping this in mind, I have a hazy idea that looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you run the client you get to choose your handle, but it's not unique (cf. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle">Zooko's Triangle</a>)</li>
<li>When you run the client for the first time, it creates an RSA keypair for you.</li>
<li>When composing messages, the client signs the message with your private key (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#Signing_messages">description on Wikipedia</a>)</li>
<li>When rendering messages, the client validates the signature against your public key and shows something like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identicon">identicon</a> of the public key.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implications of this setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>No registration</li>
<li>Your "password" (private key) never leaves your device(s).</li>
<li>When reading a thread you see a handle like  <code>spiralganglion</code> . However, the handle is not authoritative. Next to it is an identicon that is authoritative.</li>
<li>It's easy in a thread to see if there are ever two people with the same handle but different identicons.</li>
<li>Since the client platform is starting from scratch, accessibility and internationalization will be a challenge for a long time 😕</li>
</ul>
<p>No guarantees this is all doable. It's quite possible the cryptographic operations will be untenably slow when implemented in Lua, and a native library for them would complicate the simple install story that is LÖVE's greatest strength.</p>
<p>But I'm curious to get people's thoughts on this idea in principle.</p>

<p>Maybe more of a general coding question but how do you y’all feel about database/stores that add fields to your documents that insert?</p>
<p>E.g. you insert  <code>{ name: 'Titanic', director: 'James Cameron' }</code>  into  <code>movies</code>  and when you fetch it you get back  <code>{_id: 1234, _col: 'movies', name: 'Titanic', director: 'James Cameron' }</code> </p>
<p>Does that bug you? Don’t care?</p>
<p>Are there any ways to get around this so there aren’t won’t ever have collections between user defined fields and internal metadata?</p>

<p>One of the things I am curious about is how a11y relates to the future of coding. So far it doesn't seem to come up in the discussions on the podcast but I think there is something to be said about the advancement in a11y in computing over the last 25 years and a large part of this is due to a movement away from some of the more creative interface designs (ala Magic Ink). Is there a future of code that is more accessible to people with different abilities?</p>

<p>In the past year or 2, I got interested in OO and I find even its basic form within a mainstream language very powerful.</p>
<p>Yet, when I try to advocate for using polymorphism in almost any context, I get "this is too unfamiliar"/"that's not how we do things in framework X" instead advocating for switch statements or similar.</p>
<p>And it really gets me thinking, if we don't even understand OO after 30 years of mainstream adoption (in some form or another) and are still doing "structured programming" with lambdas &amp; objects, is generic code just hopeless in practice? Is there an education problem? Is it just indicative of how poor standards are that few people have the privilege to do any amount of design for their systems before developing?</p>
<p>If so, how does "future of coding" even matter if any form of real adoption feels impossible.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>(Making a new thread about this because the other one has become about OO instead of this bit)</p>
<p>I feel this deeply. It can often feel as if things don't get adopted. That programming doesn't change for the better. I have so many thoughts on this, it is hard to summarize.</p>
<p>First, I do think we can get others to adopt the things we value. It is almost never an education issue, imo and instead a value question. (I am intentionally leaving aside the OO frame here). Think about the impact that Rich Hickey has had on how many people code, not just clojure people, but in the industry broadly. How did he do it? Through Simple Made Easy, a talk largely about values, not techniques. The same is true of Bret Victor's influence on the future of coding community. He communicated values that others adopted.</p>
<p>I've found this to be true in practice as well. Trying to convince people to change their coding style requires diligence, communicating values, and showing how code improves because of these values. Conflict often happens when people implicitly hold very different values. I'm going to bet that is the case in the original example given.</p>
<p>But I also want to step back and ask, what kind of adoption, by who, by how many people? I'm willing to bet a lot of people in this slack listen to some genre of music that isn't completely mainstream. Have those genres failed because of the lack of becoming mainstream? Would they be better if they became mainstream?</p>

<p>What do people here think about the REBL (read-eval-browse-loop) and the ‘Data Rabbit’ project which evolved from it?</p>
<p>Both are tools originating in Clojure, but where the REBL is about mixing writing/running Clojure with having a graphical interface to drill down into the output data (e.g. a natural ‘visual programming’ evolution of a REPL),</p>
<p>I’d describe Data Rabbit as the opposite: A data inspection/‘dashboard creation’ tool where you can do most tasks visually, only dropping down to Clojure if you want to do really custom things (or create new types of ‘blocks’/interactions).</p>

<p>And in not totally unrelated fashion, there’s PureData (FOSS) / Cycling76' Max (paid), which are reasonably successful graph-based programming languages for digital music synthesizers.</p>
<p>I expect that in that particular case graph-based programming is so successful because it is a direct translation of how (analog) modular synthesizers used to be patched together, flattening the learning curve for musicians.</p>

<p><em>Concatenative Programming Projection</em> </p>
<p>2022 –  <strong><em>Interleaved 2D Notation for Concatenative Programming</em></strong>  – by <strong>@Michael Homer</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://mwh.nz/pdf/paint2022">Direct link to the paper</a></p>
<p>It's a concatenative language.</p>
<p>It's not a stack based language. Slight differences I guess.</p>
<p>Also questionably point free with with the values unnamed but live values still shown.</p>
<p><em>Comparison to stack based languages</em> </p>
<p>★  <strong><em>Similarities to a stack based language:</em></strong> </p>
<p>– also no variable names</p>
<p>– also the typical operations: dup, swap, dig</p>
<p>– also only variables with an arity of one or more (aka functions) are shown (and literals)</p>
<p>★  <strong><em>Differences:</em></strong> </p>
<p>– There's no reverse polish notation.</p>
<p>– Unlike in in a stack based language there's no single stack.</p>
<p>Rather the representation make opportunities for parallel evaluation quite obvious.</p>
<p>– Variables have no names but are still displaying their live value like in a spreadsheet (not referring to the layout).</p>
<p>⚠  <strong><em>It seems this is actually not a language but a projections style.</em></strong> </p>
<p>This is nice, meaning to some degree other language can potentially be projected into this representation.</p>
<p>Well, plus-minus some issues. Syntactic sugar mostly not carrying over. Readability in other projections.</p>
<p>Switching to a different projection one may want to give out human readable variable names though rather than assigning auto-generated ones.</p>
<p>Maybe this would be a viable additional projection target for some other languages (unison)?</p>
<p>No clue though how this would interact with algebraic effects.</p>
<p><em>Comparison to <a href="http://apm.bplaced.net/w/index.php?title=Annotated_lambda_diagram">ALDs</a></em> </p>
<p><strong><em>Relation of Michael Homers model to annotated lambda diagrams:</em></strong> </p>
<p>★ ALDs give same obviousness of parallelity opportunities</p>
<p>★ Unclear which representation is visually denser but likely not the ALDs</p>
<p>★ ALDs (as in the current mockups) are not pointfree. Variable names do appear both …</p>
<p>– at the head of the function definition (and tops of let- and in- blocks) and</p>
<p>– as annotations of the horizontal value lines (i.e. as the arguments to functions)</p>
<p>★ For Making the ALD code projection more aligned with Michael Homers model:</p>
<p>– replace value names with live values</p>
<p>– collapse let-in-blocks by substitution</p>
<p>(live values could still be added as "syngraphic" sugar in extended value lines, I digress …)</p>
<p>★ flip &amp; dig (argument permutators)</p>
<p>– They both vanish in the ALD code projection no matter their location.</p>
<p>– They are just permuting the arguments by swapping application lines and all preceding dependents.</p>
<p>★ dup</p>
<p>– only vanishes at the top level as it turns into two forks.</p>
<p>– otherwise less trivial as it induces an unavoidable let-in block.</p>
<p>(Uncurrying into tuples is a bad alternative as it hides away ALD circuitry, the whole point of ALDs)</p>

<p>I know it's ancient tech, but there are so few parts of my computer where I can freely mix styled text, code,  <em>and</em>  data, and Mathematica is the only one where doing so feels remotely natural.</p>
<p>I was inspired to post something by recent workflow breakthroughs in how I keep my lab notebook, where I slice-and-dice tabular data from experiment results in-between my paragraphs of stream-of-consciousness analysis. It's a lovely way to work. My journal entries build on one another in ways they never did before, because I can use code to put the best view(s) of the data right into the notebook.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mathematical notation has serious deficiencies. In particular, it lacks universality, and must be interpreted differently according to the topic, according to the author, and even according to the immediate context. Programming languages, because they were designed for the purpose of directing computers, offer important advantages as tools of thought. Not only are they universal (general-purpose), but they are also executable and unambiguous. Executability makes it possible to use computers to perform extensive experiments on ideas expressed in a programming language, and the lack of ambiguity makes possible precise thought experiments. In other respects, however, most programming languages are decidedly inferior to mathematical notation and are little used as tools of thought in ways that would be considered significant by, say, an applied mathematician.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thesis of the present paper is that the advantages of executability and universality found in programming languages can be effectively combined, in a single coherent language, with the advantages offered by mathematical notation.</p>

<p>I shared this as a response to a message earlier today, but I think it may be worth sharing here, too!</p>
<p>Pluralsight <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/resource-center/guides/new-developer-research-paper">shared some interesting research they just completed</a>. The research seeks to validate a framework that can be used to understand developers’ relationship to AI.</p>
<p>Quoting from the data highlights of the landing page:</p>
<ul>
<li>43-45% of developers studied showed evidence of worry, anxiety and fear about whether they could succeed in this era of rapid generative-AI adoption with their current technical skill sets.</li>
<li>Learning culture and belonging on software teams predicted a decrease in AI Skill Threat &amp; an increase in both individual developer productivity and overall team effectiveness.</li>
<li>
<em>74% of software developers are planning to upskill in AI-assisted coding. However, there are important emerging equity gaps, with female developers and LGBTQ+ developers reporting significantly lower intent to upskill. On the other hand, Racially Minoritized developers reported significantly higher intentions to upskill.</em> </li>
<li>56% of Racially Minoritized developers reported a negative perception of AI Quality, compared with 28% of all developers.</li>

<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>Very proud to introduce ⚡️Hyperlayer - Debug Rails apps 10x faster:</p>
<p>☝ Code and demo video in the repo.</p>
<p>It works by creating a visualisation layer which combines application flow, state and the code itself. It utilises Tracepoint and AST under the hood to build the visualisation. This visualisation means you can cut out a significant portion of the steps we have to go through to "manually" debug an issue, leading to the timesave.</p>
<p>I would absolutely welcome any feedback. I think it could be a big deal!</p>
<p>I'm really excited about being able to share this with the world.</p>

<p>Started working on a prolog backend for coil.</p>
<p>Here's an example of compiling a coil program to prolog &amp; exploring the codebase via prolog repl.</p>
<p>This is early but the hope is to have an easily explorable codebase, to really treat the codebase as a database.</p>
<p>Ambition for this is</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow users of coil to write their own rules in prolog to ensure things about the program</li>
<li>Make writing a type checker easier for me</li>
<li>Make writing tooling for coil easier</li>

<p><a href="https://m-ld.org/">m-ld</a> is a component for sharing live information peer-to-peer. (Lots of materials at the link, and click the big green button to <a href="https://js.m-ld.org/">find code playgrounds</a>.)</p>
<p>It's intended to allow programs to be written "local-first", having a reactive local model that is concurrently editable from multiple remote locations, with a guarantee of eventual consistency. So, you more-or-less write your code as if the data is 100% local, embedding m-ld as a library, and magically find that other remote participants can read and write the data too (subject to security!).</p>
<p>There are two main use-cases we're targeting – client apps, like office tools, supporting collaborative editing (GDocs-style); and microservices sharing information like configuration or master data. In both cases, you don't need a (extra) server for the data (though you do need a way to pass messages, for example a pubsub).</p>
<p>I've been working on this for a while so there's a million things I could ramble on about, but I'm curious to know if the above pricks up anyone's ears. Do those use-cases sound, well, useful? Does my description make you want to know more, or, ho-hum? Any feedback is welcome; will return with recent focus later! Many thanks</p>

<p>I'm looking at defining a collaboration-centered language that has sound semantics (ie semantics under composition are intentional and generally useful)</p>
<p>My understanding is that you can only verify semantics for a specific model, so trying to define a "good enough" model</p>

<p>Has anyone thought about or written about malleable software + LLM:s? I feel that it is an area that could be quite interesting, but I haven't got yet a clear understanding on what this will lead to.</p>
<p>I think that pretty soon most of end-user code will be generated with the help of LLM:s. Some thoughts/questions I've been thinking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How to generate programming languages, libraries and abstractions that LLM:s can use well? Is that different from generating libraries etc for humans?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LLM:s are faster than humans in processing data, so API:s can be really wide and probably more complex than what would be practical for devs. </p>
</li>
<li>LLM:s can probably handle more condensed/optimized representation better, too. </li>
<li>
<p>And be able to infer system affordances directly from code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to support creating good and maintainable code from LLM:s? And will that matter? Or will actual code become irrelevant?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to modularize apps so that they can be easily composed by LLM:s?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My hunch: making apps modular and composable would work really well with LLM:s already now and even better in the future. Doesn't matter if functional or OOP, as long as the LLM can understand the logic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kinds of new apps and malleable software will LLM:s enable?</p>
</li>
<li>Also: LLM:s could finally enable removing some boundaries between different programming tools, library ecosystems, etc, by enabling translations/bridges automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p><a href="http://akkartik.name/about">Kartik Agaram</a>'s draft programmer's pledge reminded me of Ursula Franklin's checklist for technology projects, which is a bit hidden in one of her really excellent 1986 lectures on the "real world of technology"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“… whether it:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(1) promotes justice;</p>
<p>(2) restores reciprocity;</p>
<p>(3) confers divisible or indivisible benefits;</p>
<p>(4) favours people over machines;</p>
<p>(5) whether its strategy maximizes gain or minimizes disaster;</p>
<p>(6) whether conservation is favoured over waste; and</p>
<p>(7), whether the reversible is favoured over the irreversible?”</p>
<p>I tried to <a href="https://slab.org/2022/02/11/ursula-franklins-tech-project-checklist/">summarise these points in a blog post here</a> or you can <a href="https://archive.org/details/the-real-world-of-technology">listen to the lectures</a> directly, or <a href="https://archive.org/details/realworldoftechn0000fran_u9w8/page/n9/mode/2up">read it in book form</a>.</p>
<p>I'll pull out a couple of quotes, first on 3) divisible/indivisible benefits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you have a garden and your friends help you to grow a tremendous tomato crop, you can share it out among those who helped. What you have obtained is a divisible benefit and the right to distribute it. Whoever didn’t help you, may not get anything. On the other hand, if you work hard to fight pollution and you and your friends succeed in changing the practices of the battery-recycling plant down the street, those who helped you get the benefits, but those who didn’t get them too. What you and your friends have obtained are indivisible benefits.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and on 7) reversible vs irreversible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The last item is obviously important. Considering that most projects do not work out as planned, it would be helpful if they proceeded in a way that allowed revision and learning, that is, in small reversible steps.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>5) on maximising gain vs minimising disaster is also a really interesting point, where she argues against planning, and for finding the right conditions for something to grow, at its own rate.</p>

<p>I just (finally) figured out how to represent my coding language as a directed multi-graph with labeled edges. Now I'm wondering if the interpretation steps could be represented as graph translations, so you could literally "watch" it execute. Anyone have any ideas for libraries that I could use to explore that idea, or examples I could look to? My current best guess is NetworkX and visdcc+dash.</p>

<p>What does it mean to you when someone says something like “code as literature?”</p>
<p>Often the implication seems to be that code should be  <em>readable</em>  — which I take to mean “understandable,” which I further take to me “as a person looking at this code I can map what it’s output will be.”</p>
<p>Where my specific hangup enters is that a lot of literature isn’t directly “understandable” in this sense. There are many layers at which to understand literature. How about code? Code as more than it’s outcomes.</p>

<p>Did a technical assignment for an interview this week, and made extensive use of ChatGPT4 to great success. It's to the point now that if I get an error message I don't understand, or get to a step where I'm unclear what to do next, I'll try ChatGPT4 before I will try Google, because with ChatGPT4 it already has the context for the problem, and gives me an answer specific to my context. Very different programming experience.</p>

<p>I was curious this morning: my naïve view of compiler history is that they used to be very small (due to performance constraints) and have gotten very complicated over the years in order to support multiple platforms and in order to employ more and more optimizations. Is that generally a fair take? What are the big changes to compiler architectures from the early days? Does something like LLVM produce enough better code to justify its complexity? Are there any blog post- or paper-length history of compilers articles out there? (I'm not quite so curious as to be ready to read a whole book, but if you've got a good recommendation…)</p>

<p>A question that came up in a discussion this morning:</p>
<p>Suppose you want to publish a command-line utility program, meant to be easy to use. Doing Web retrieval and some post-processing. Around 500 lines in a typical scripting language, but with dependencies (in that language plus C libraries).</p>
<p>It looks like packaging such a tool for all popular platforms (i.e. package managers) will be a lot more work than actually writing the code.</p>
<p>True? Any way to avoid this?</p>
<p>Ideas so far: don't use a scripting language, but something with a compiler that can produce portable executables for every major platform. Recommendations in that category so far: Go, Rust, Racket, Common Lisp. I have doubts that all of these can handle "plus C libraries", but it's a start.</p>
<p>Does anyone here have actual experience with this kind of project?</p>

<p>Lately I've been <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Pxpyok4TDNsuWs1d6">experimenting with recognition of hand-drawn symbols in embedded structures</a>, working with Luke Iannini in Realtalk</p>
<p>Thinking about how perceptually salient properties (such as spikiness/roundness, wonkiness) could be taken into account in a kind of analogue interpretation of the shapes alongside discrete symbol recognition as 'signposts' in feature space.</p>
<p>and what happens to those features when some symbols are marked out as higher order functions.</p>
<p>Thinking about syntax based on proximity and containment rather than adjacency.</p>
<p>also what happens when the parser itself is part of the scene.. e.g. how does its orientation change the parsing of the symbols?</p>
<p>Would love to hear about other projects that have explored this kind of area!</p>

<p>This week no short video, just a report of my progress on building a visual programming system :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I've started experimenting with having multiple layers in a visual flow.. as inspiration I think of pcb's which are used in electronic devices where components and connections can live on different layers. Hopefully this can help in keeping the flows becoming a big pile of spaghetti and better scalable. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another new experiment is an import function that can import a textual program and convert it to a visual flow. In my engine I already use a small custom language which is parsed to an AST and transpile that to javascript within some node-types.. so, with this import function a script in this language can be converted to a visual flow.. it's still in its infancies , but I even want to try and convert a javascript/typescript file to a visual flow. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Made some new node-types to support functions within a visual-flow. Since I don't use a port-based/pull mechanism for the flow-runner that runs the visual program, the function parameters are send as a payload (which is a dictionary of keys and values).. and in the function node you can define the expected parameters.. currently these are not typed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully I can find some time to make a video later this week.</p>

<p>Reflecting more on Amy Ko's recent work on Wordplay, I think part of what makes it successful is that it's an art project - playing with typography is just a really nice domain to make alternative programming languages in - playing with symbols, with symbols. It's a shame that the arts are often pushed out of 'future of coding' type circles. E.g. compare the first LIVE workshop on Live Programming which had loads of music-focussed contributions, with recent editions where the focus seems much more on abstract ideas for which 'real world' applications have not yet been found.</p>
<p>My understanding is that part of the reason for this is that for CS academics, associating their work with creative applications is generally seen very much as a career-limiting move</p>

<p>I went away from FoC for a few weeks and dropped by today and I have to say I'm blown away by the diversity of creative and innovative work being brought to light here. And, bizarrely, how little discussion is being initiated by the posts! Is everyone so focused on their own stuff that they're not available for engaging in a broader perspective? I'm worried that a lot of great stuff could be going the wrong way or could fizzle simply through lack of community coherence. Dunno. Whaddyall think?</p>

<p>Some thoughts re: ‘67 Considered Harmful’:</p>
<p><em>Superparentheses</em> :</p>
<p>Love the discussion about this topic 😛. Haskell has  <code>$</code>  which means ‘opening parenthesis that is closed by the end of the line’ which gets a bit close to the idea of a ‘super opening parenthesis’.</p>
<p><em>C and GOTO:</em> </p>
<p>C came out after this paper, and its  <code>goto</code>  statement was neutered: It only allows  <em>local</em>  jumps (remaining in the same function) and only to hard-coded labels (though <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.8.0/gcc/Labels-as-Values.html#Labels-as-Values">a common GCC compiler extension</a> extends this to allow dynamic labels).</p>
<p>The closest C gets to unrestricted GOTO is  <code>setjmp</code> / <code>longjmp</code> ; but here the  <em>callee decides</em> where you jump to (just like with exceptions) so you can really only jump up on the stack, making them slightly less painful to reason about.</p>
<p>Neither gets used a lot: I mainly know the  <code>goto sosueme</code> idiom from a few of the talks of Alexei Alexandrescu in which he uses it in a hot code path because the resulting machine code is better optimized. And  <code>setjmp</code> / <code>longjmp</code>  is used in some places to emulate exceptions or coroutines in plain C, but whenever the OS provides higher-level abstractions to use here they are preferred (just like how OS support for threading is better than rolling your own spin-locks).</p>

<p>And making a separate topic for the second half of the episode about the list of other ‘things considered harmful’ because it is mostly separate from the previous discussion ^_^’:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of your takes are actually luke-warm, in my opinion. 🙂 </li>
<li>Agile (with capital A) considered harmful: 100% agree with your discussion here.</li>
<li>Dependency Injection considered harmful: I disagree. You can definitely use it too much and it would be better if people would approach it from the dependency inversion principle side, but it definitely is better than tightly coupling your code on implementation details. And related to that, I’d like to add:</li>
<li>Inheritance considered harmful: Why do we still teach new programmers how to do inheritance? Besides ‘prefer composition over inheritance’, have we not learned in the last 20-ish years that doing polymorphism based on interfaces/traits creates much more maintainable code?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>The next paradigm beyond capitalism</em> </p>
<p>These are some rough thoughts I wasn't expecting to share publicly for a long time, if at all, but it seems to be inevitable for me to hit a point of, wth, throw it out there. In this case the impetus was <strong>@Alex McLean</strong>'s comments on <a href="posts/future-of-coding-weekly-202310-week-2/?fromDate=2023-10-03&amp;toDate=2023-10-09&amp;channel=linking-together&amp;filter=#2023-10-06T04:45:36.918Z">💬 #linking-together</a></p>
<p>The way I see it, capitalism currently performs many load-bearing functions in the world, but the world today suffers from capitalism being the predominant engine of meaning/motivation. Why do we get out of bed and do anything? The places we tend to pay attention to are governed by social proof, a sense that others are paying attention. Social proof is in turn governed by status seeking; we all want to be "successful", and in our efforts to be successful we chase the prospects of success around us. We're more likely to attend to something if it promises to be successful. And finally, closing the loop, the metrics for "success" are basically money at root. Everything else seems to get grounded at some level of indirection in money.</p>
<p>All this hit home particularly hard when listening to the first hour of <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/065">episode 65</a> (totally awesome, and having nothing to do with the title), where <a href="http://ivanish.ca/">Ivan Reese</a> at one point says, to be taken seriously you have to signal effort. And at a second point: one way to signal effort is to spend a lot of money. All totally right and obvious for the world we live in. And yet.. I'm kinda feeling done with seeing large projects spending lots of money as more intrinsically meaningful? We've seen many many examples of the same depressing way large projects with lots of money fail. Money invariably has strings attached.</p>
<p>So, I'd like to live in a world where money exists, but more people consider it a satisficing rather than optimizing criterion. Something that inhabits the lower levels of Maslow's Hierarchy and gets banished from the upper level that it has somehow infected while we weren't looking.</p>
<p>What might replace money as a source of meaning and motivation for programmers? One answer I've been rolling around in my mouth and feeling increasingly ok with is: durability. Durability has a long track record (i.e. monuments) as something that can motivate people. Software is currently really bad at building durable artifacts, and not I think for any intrinsic reason. We just haven't prioritized it. I think a world where software artifacts can be easily run a decade later -- without any modification -- would be a significantly better world than the one we live in. In such a world, software would be part of the solution rather than the problem.</p>
<p>So, with that lengthy preamble, here's the draft I've been noodling on.</p>
<p><em>Draft: A programmer's pledge</em> </p>
<p>Given that:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are on this planet for a brief time and will take nothing with us when we leave; and that</li>
<li>The effects of our actions compound for good and for ill, long after we are gone, in ways we cannot always anticipate; and that</li>
<li>I want to be helpful to others, and for the good in my actions to outweigh the bad; and that</li>
<li>I want to persuade you that I truly believe the above, that I want to be helpful more than I care about my own gain and aggrandizement;</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, I pledge to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell you, when I build anything, what I hope to gain from it. If it's money I'll tell you how much in inflation-adjusted currency, and I'll commit to giving away anything beyond that while unencumbering any secrets it took to create it. If I create organizations or foundations around what I build, I'll enshrine these limits on value capture into their bylaws.</li>
<li>Tell you, up front, when it will be done. I'll provide a clear test for features I will add, and when I will stop adding features.</li>
<li>Show my thought process in my efforts to make it durable. Even after it's done, it might need changes to be runnable on people's computers. What have I done to minimize the likelihood of such changes? What have I learned from past projects that makes this one more durable than them?</li>
</ul>

<p>Quantitative Program Reasoning with Graded Modal Types: Most programming languages treat data as infinitely copiable, arbitrarily discardable, and universally unconstrained. However, this overly abstract view is naïve and can lead to software errors. For example, some data encapsulates resources subject to protocols (e.g., file and device handles, channels); some data has confidentiality requirements and thus should not be copied or communicated</p>
<p>arbitrarily. Dually, some programs have non-functional properties (e.g., execution time) dependenton data (e.g., on its size). Thus, the reality is that some data acts as a resource, subject to constraints. In this paper we present Granule, a typed functional language that embeds a notion of data as a resource into the type system in a way that can be specialised to different resource and dataflow properties. Granule’s type system combines linear types, indexed types (lightweight dependent types), and graded modal types to enable novel quantitative reasoning.</p>

<p>Has anyone else been watching <a href="https://duskos.org/">Dusk OS</a> dev take place? I subscribe to the git commits in my RSS reader and watching the progress made on this project in real time is a pretty wild experience.</p>
<p>I think some folks around here may find the “<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/fs/doc/cc/index.txt">almost C</a>” compiler implemented in forth interesting.</p>

<p><strong>@Alex McLean</strong> for a small side road into music representation -- here's a wonderful insta account to follow; linking one recent example here: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cs85ZUoB2xs/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">musicriyaaz account focusing on on a unique music representation for voice</a></p>

<p>[October 8th, 2023 10:47 AM] alex952: &lt;@UCUSW7WVD&gt; it's been a while.. but working on payment processing was mostly writing c code to pre-written specs but there was some room for finding creative solutions to problems.. A big part of making music for me is making new representations for music, which is really hard and is definitely some of the most interesting and technically challenging work I've done in my career. Actually making live music by live coding does feel very different though in a number of ways.. Being fully absorbed in the sonic output of your code while changing it, with a room full of people are dancing to it, is just a lovely time. It does seem like a very different activity to systems programming, but someone has to program the live coding system in the first place, and building and using systems happens in the same community, with everyone coding in some way.. like with dynamicland, things can get interesting when you break down the barriers between systems programming and live interaction.</p>

<p>I don’t know how I missed it in the announcement, but  ~<em><em>when you use an LLM chat cell in Mathematica, it sends</em></em>~  ~<em><em>all</em></em>~  ~<em><em>the cells above it as context.</em></em>~ </p>
<p>I realized that was happening when the LLM happened to refer to code I’d written in one of its answers. Now I just straight up ask it “Why?” when something surprising happens.</p>
<p>I haven’t made a single non-chat notebook since I figured this out. 🌈 </p>

<p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/362929.362947">Go To Statement Considered Harmful</a> is a solid classic entry in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Considered_harmful">X Considered Harmful</a> metafiction genre, authored by renowned computer scientist and idiosyncratic grump, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra">Edsger Wybe Dijkstra</a>. Surprisingly (given the impact it's had) this is a minuscule speck of a paper, lasting only 1-ish pages, and it even digresses several times from the main point. Fear not! Jimmy and I spend the entirety of these two podcast hours thoroughly analyzing the paper, wringing every last drop of insight from it, speaking directly to how programming ought to be reimagined from the molten venture capital core on up. Yes indeed, this is another episode in the fine tradition of Future of Coding where we stay faithfully close to the text, we leave the second-order implications alone, and there's nothing more than that. Nothing portended, nothing changed.</p>

<p>Bubble sort is a simple algorithm and offcourse in a real-live scenario you won't implement this using a visual programming environment... however, it's a nice test-case to help building a visual programming environment because it needs to be able to modify an array amongst other things.. So I've introduced the concept of being able to send commands to an array-node. When items are swapped, this is visualized by the array-node with some borders flashing and changing colors around the items that are being swapped. <a href="https://youtu.be/Xp235l_YjCY">🎥 bubble sort implemented in a visual flow</a> .. furthermore the array is iterated using a foreach-node which triggers a sub-flow for each array item.</p>

<p>Re: <a href="https://overcast.fm/p4449364-F69ROU">Future of Coding</a> - Apple Vision &amp; Dynamicland</p>
<p>Probably unpopular ideas, but here's my Black Mirror take:</p>
<ul>
<li>What's tasteful won't matter, as long as it's popular.</li>
<li>Success of these "spatial computing" concepts will come from what gets the masses interested.</li>
<li>Whatever will be successful, porn will do first, as they always have. Now the action is with you, or you're "there". Consent from other people actually with you is left as an exercise for the reader.</li>
<li>Ditto for Snapchat-like filters that are applied to other people in the room with you. Everyone naked? Everyone's a furry? Maybe we present virtually as we choose for other goggle-heads? Back to consent again, for, "who wants to see the naked furry centaur in the coffee shop?"</li>
<li>Extra points for integrating Dynamicland-like badges that people wear, interpreted by the goggles as, "don't VR-alter me." Another one for, "don't apply facial recognition to me." Naturally, law enforcement gets a version that the latter filter doesn't apply for, and the tech leaks to hacky patches for consumer hardware.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm making a basic color picker for my designed-for-children VR animation program (streaming development here <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/hamish_todd/videos">twitch.tv/hamish_todd/videos</a>). Simple question: is it a good idea for "eraser" to be a "color" in my color picker, rather than its own button? Veeeeery limited number of buttons on a VR controller and I want to minimize menus!</p>

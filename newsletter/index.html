<p>You know that thing when playing Pokemon games where after you throw a Pokeball you frantically tap the action button to ... do something? It is never made clear if this helps or even does anything at all.</p>
<p>What are other ghost-mechanics like this in games or software that you know of, where folks often take actions that aren’t clearly signposted to actually do anything?</p>
<p>The most immediate other example that comes to mind is swiping apps away in the iOS app switcher, but that isn’t exactly the same thing, since, even if it doesn’t free up memory, it is a direct interaction that alters state (removes options from the app switcher).</p>

<p><em>Retrofitting of Medium</em> </p>
<p>I tend to think every time a new medium is introduced, all the contents of the previous medium are ported over,  <em>without regard for fully understanding the new medium</em> . For instance, films matured when it stopped porting over books, games matured when it stopped porting over movies, etc. An excellent example of this is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/">Outer Wilds</a>, a space-exploration time-traveling game which is simply impossible to recreate in any other medium. It fulfills the medium.</p>
<p>Given that, I think two new forms of medium are being introduced in the next 5 years: <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-paradigm/#:~:text=Summary%3A%20AI%20is%20introducing%20the,reversing%20the%20locus%20of%20control.">LLMs</a> and VR. If we accept the supposition that there will be a lot of retrofitting of the medium, i.e. chat into LLMs, games into VR,  <em>what are the content that will truly fulfill the mediums of LLMs and VR?</em> </p>

<p>Is there a reasonably decent JavaScript library that allows me to have a reasonably terminal-y experience in the browser, so I can implement a shell? Ideally with history, autocomplete, colors, etc. - and then with the ability to add DOM nodes too, so I can click, show images, etc. Preferably no backend necessary.</p>

<p>A new book caught my eye and maybe it'll catch yours?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The cultural ramifications of online live streaming, including its effects on identity and power in digital spaces.</em> 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some consider live streaming—the broadcasting of video and/or audio footage live online—simply an internet fad or source of entertainment, yet it is at the center of the digital mediation of our lives. In this edited volume, Johanna Brewer, Bo Ruberg, Amanda L. L. Cullen, and Christopher J. Persaud present a broad range of essays that explore the cultural implications of live streaming, paying special attention to how it is shifting notions of identity and power in digital spaces. The diverse set of international authors included represent a variety of perspectives, from digital media studies to queer studies, from human-computer interaction to anthropology, and more.</p>

<p>Test-driven development has the potential to turn #programming into a gameplay-like experience. Add live collaborators, real-time evaluation of relevant tests, visual feedback etc.</p>
<p>I had built this toy more than a decade ago. The tests would be evaluated on each keystroke and visually indicated as Red vs Green. Felt like fun.</p>

<p>(Hopefully this question isn’t too far outside of “coding” and into “using”.) I’ve always had an interest in associative data management, but I’ve never found a tool I love for my use case. What I want to be able to do is catalog and visually explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideas in some area of research</li>
<li>Sources for those ideas: who has presented them</li>
<li>Chains of reasoning: person A argues that because of ideas X and Y, therefore Z is true</li>
<li>Commentary on those ideas: supporting, refuting, adapting</li>
</ul>
<p>General mind-mapping tools don’t feel structured enough, but coding it from scratch has been intimidating. It feels like this must exist and I must just be bad at finding it. Do any of you have a tool you like for this use?</p>

<p>I’ve been re-building Subset.so to make it way easier to reuse templates directly in the editor. The idea is that you should be able to build beautiful spreadsheets without starting from scratch. For example if you want to build dashboard with a P&amp;L and inputs, you can find both templates and drop them into the same editor. The concept is pretty common in design editors like Canva where you can look up and drop in design elements, but haven’t seen it done with spreadsheets before. Here’s a 7 second demo</p>

<p>So more expressive than something like sinatra, but running at cool 140K requests/s.</p>
<p>The dichotomy between expressiveness/comfort and performance is a false one, a bit like the one we used to have between user-friendly but crashy client-operating systems and solid but unfriendly server operating systems.  Now my phone and my watch both run Unix.</p>

<p>Hi all, for those of us who have an interest in learning about how to build a more wonderful future and who wish to be inspired by those rare few actually building something different, I recommend that you visit and enjoy the Norman Foster exhibit at the Centre Pompidou which ends on the 7th of August.</p>
<p>Those who are unfamiliar may not see the relevance of a building architect's work to programmers and software / hardware designers, but I assure you that his long history of work is exceptionally relevant.</p>
<p>His designs are a deeply-considered human-scale 'high-tech' alternative to traditionalist buildings and to postmodern buildings. With tonnes of innovative features which had never been implemented before and which seemed obvious and common-sense after the fact.</p>
<p>This work sounds a lot like what we are working on in the software, hardware and otherwise industrial realms.</p>
<p>If you are in Paris or are able to get to Paris, entry is 17 euros.</p>
<p>I'll be going on the 7th of August if anyone is around for drinks, lunch and/or a chat 🙂</p>

<p>I've found this article on using CozoDB (A relational/graph database) as the hypocampus for AI. It's an interesting read though it's probably best to leave it explained in their own words <a href="https://docs.cozodb.org/en/latest/releases/v0.6.html">docs.cozodb.org/en/latest/releases/v0.6.html</a></p>
<p>What do people think, is this approach plausible? Will it make a notcable different to what AI's can do? The author has also written their own knowledge management tool so interesting all round.</p>

<p>I'm not sure I've seen that level of doc integration in  <em>any</em>  language env, yet an interpreter/compiler doing the actual parsing and name resolution should be well positioned to offer it, no?</p>

<p>Hi, I am experimenting with functionality to be able to inspect "path executions" in a visual flow (the flow in the video is adding random values to an array of which the total sum is calculated): in the short video you can see me inspecting the last executed path with the slider on the bottom.. with this you can inspect the different stages of an executed path. After a flow has been run, the last path can be inspected.</p>
<p>With the slider on the right you can switch between paths which have been executed before.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the video I've pressed the 'run' button multiple times, all these executions can be inspected with this slider.. and the current execution path that is being inspected can be inspected further with the slider on the bottom.</p>

<p>Hey folks, I’ve just launched the beta of the side project app I shared a video about a few months ago. I’ve settled on the name Riverbed. It allows you to create mini-apps to track your personal information on cards, including columns that automatically filter your cards and buttons that allow you to configure simple actions on them. It’s maybe an “almost-no-code” system? You can choose actions from a list instead of typing in scripts.</p>
<p>Some of the things I’m exploring include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many types of app this card-and-column UX is helpful for,</li>
<li>How much we can accomplish in this domain in an “almost-no-code” approach, where instead of a scripting language we have a set of actions to choose from a dropdown, to make it more accessible to non-programmers, and</li>
<li>To what degree a focus on matching the UX of non-user-configurable apps is achievable or the best use of effort</li>

<p>(I shared a very early version of Magnet when it was just a Mac Desktop app - but now it fully runs on the web)</p>
<p>We just shipped a web version of 🧲 Magnet <a href="https://magnet.run">magnet.run</a> - an AI coding assistant.</p>
<p>The sign ups are growing pretty quickly and there’s a lot of love from the early users. We think you’ll like it too. It’s free to use if you put in your own OpenAI API key, and over time we’ll charge for more advanced features like integrations and access to the latest unreleased models.</p>
<p>If you’re using ChatGPT to help with coding tasks, and finding yourself copying and pasting, Magnet is similar, but built specifically for working with code. You can open local code repos, connect GitHub issues, and pick files and issues as context of for the task at hand.</p>

<p>The default behaviour for a validated text field in Blockly is to turn the background red while the value is invalid, and if the user hits enter (or nvaigates away from the field) while the field is red, abandon the change and return the field to the previous value. This feels broken to me. In the visual interface, if you try to put something somewhere and it doesn't "fit", the piece doesn't go back where it started. It stays close to where you tried to put it, but far enough away to visually indicate that it isn't connected. So you get immediate feedback that it didn't work, and what was done instead. But in the text field, if I have "value" and I change it to "value$", and the dollar sign is invalid, the field will only turn red between when I hit dollarsign and when I hit enter, and then it will go back to the previous value, and just hope I notice that it didn't do what I wanted it to do. For people who look at the keys while typing, that's not going to work. Blockly steadfastly tries to avoid invalid state, presumably because syntax errors aren't any fun. But in the visual interface it accomplishes that by making invalid syntax impossible to generate, and when it modifies the syntax for you to keep it valid, that's easy to see. Here, it lets you type an invalid value, let's you hit enter, and the fact it didn't work is potentially invisible. It feels like it should be possible to do better. Has anyone seen an interface for entering values into a text field that solves this problem? Where the field maintains a valid value, starting with a default, but it also allows you to maintain a view on failed attempts to modify it, so that you can correct them? Should the screen just go modal, not responding to "enter" or clicks outside the editor while the value is invalid? Should the failed attempt to change it be noted somewhere? Or is maintaining valid state in text fields a silly goal, and instead you should just throw errors at a later step, or something?</p>

<p>I've been working on the plugin system more for my editor. Each of these panes are a completely separate web assembly modules. The tokens and token kinds are provided by another separate module that communicates with rust analyzer. Still very early days, but exciting that I was able to whip up a simple little UI for helping me map colors to tokens rather than needing to do it manually.</p>

<p>I've had this idea rattling in my head to make a frontend framework that's  <em>only</em>  signals, and after almost a year of maturation I finally put down some code today. Genuinely surprised this works.</p>
<p>I'm curious where it starts to break down. It's not like modern frameworks are unaware of signals, most feature them heavily, so there's probably some reason they haven't gone all-in on them too, right?</p>
<p>I'm using tldraw's lovely  <code>signia</code>  for signals implementation, hence the first param of atoms being a 'name' and not meaningful for execution. This also gave me an excuse to read  <code>signia</code> 's source and discover their clever trick for tracking atom inheritance which is pretty neat.</p>

<p>I've started to work on a structural editor for my language coil <a href="https://coil-editor.netlify.app/">coil-editor.netlify.app</a></p>
<p>It's still early &amp; buggy, but the idea is to directly turn the AST into html with contenteditable for leaf attribute nodes.</p>
<p>So an expression like:</p>
<p><code>document.body</code> </p>
<p>which is the coil AST:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">{type: :property_lookup, lhs: {type: :id_lookup, name: "document"}, property: "body"}
</pre></div>

<p>Turns into:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">&lt;div</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">data-kind=</span><span class="s">"property_lookup"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

<span class="w">  </span><span class="nt">&lt;div</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">data-attr=</span><span class="s">"lhs"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">&lt;div</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">data-kind=</span><span class="s">"id_lookup"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

<span class="w">      </span><span class="nt">&lt;div</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">data-attr=</span><span class="s">"name"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">contenteditable</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>document<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>

<span class="w">  </span><span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>

<span class="w">  </span><span class="nt">&lt;div</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">data-attr=</span><span class="s">"property"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">contenteditable</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>body<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>And now we can easily query this expression with css selectors. So all the syntax highlighting AND formatting is done in css. It also means that static analysis can be done using querySelector.</p>

<p><em>I've been thinking a lot about apprenticeships over the last year and specifically the lack of apprenticeships in tech.</em> </p>
<p>My mental model of apprenticeships is primary formed around how they apply to the arts -- people learning a craft from a single practitioner who has worked their life to develop a personal style or system. But apprenticeships also exist in trade, maybe even more so. Fundamentally, apprenticeships facilitate knowledge transfer -- all industries can benefit from that, no? So, I wonder why apprenticeships are far less common in software?</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it because so many industry vets were themselves self taught and so that mindset has lingered?</li>
<li>Is it that so much of our industry is focused on access, democratization, and open sharing of information?</li>
<li>Could it be that we need to train more software engineers than we have hours in the day, and that need for more qualified minds has pushed us beyond the 1-on-1 learning paradigm and towards bootcamps etc?</li>
<li>Maybe so much of software and the knowledge around it is already accessible, so apprenticeships are just overkill? That said, there are still pockets of software where subject matter expertise and knowledge silos outweigh what is either 1) commonly taught in schools or 2) generally available.</li>
<li>Software doesn't have the same requirements around professional certifications -- could that be at play?</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, do you all think there's value in apprenticeships or should we (continue to) move in the other direction entirely -- teach the masses? In that sense, I could see the argument that apprenticeships border on nepotism and are actually a form of gatekeeping. Have any of you been part of a formal apprenticeship (on either end)? If so, what conditions made that possible?</p>

<p><em>What we talk about when we talk about expressivity</em> </p>
<p>I enjoyed the little tangent on expressivity in the latest episode. I've had thoughts on this recently and it prompted me to skim Felleisen's paper. I really resonated with the hosts' reframing of expressivity as being the part of the language that's oriented towards the programmer, not towards the machine.</p>
<p>I currently think that most programmers, when talking about "expressivity", actually mean essentially two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can use my own words</li>
<li>I am not restricted by grammar</li>
</ul>
<p>These things are strongly tied to writing, as that's still how we do most of our coding.</p>
<p>"Using my own words" is literally that - in any given chunk of source text, how many of the words were chosen by the programmer (e.g. to be particular to their domain or their theory of the program) and how many were specified by the language or environment? Punctuation, I think, also counts as words the programmer didn't get to choose. Random examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Ruby, one can create little DSLs where almost all words in a specific part of the code are "my own words"</li>
<li>In assembly languages, the programmer can choose almost none of the words (except labels?)</li>
<li>Being able to rename imported symbols lets the programmer choose their own words in specific contexts (same goes for type aliases, etc.)</li>
<li>Languages with few keywords should tend to have more words chosen by the programmer... or at least, by the authors of the standard library?</li>
</ul>
<p>I equate being "unrestricted by grammar" roughly to whether a language is statement-oriented or expression-oriented. The Austral spec has a great section on why it chose to be statement-oriented, and concludes that "a statement-oriented syntax is less simple, but it forces code to be structurally simple": <a href="https://austral-lang.org/spec/spec.html#stmt-orientation">austral-lang.org/spec/spec.html#stmt-orientation</a></p>
<p>In Austral, it's an ideological choice to force programs into a certain shape. But in general, it seems to me that languages with less "grammatical restrictions" in their parser are described as more expressive. Maybe this is just correlation with other features of those languages.</p>
<p>I'd love to know how everyone else understands "expressivitiy" when we talk about programming.</p>

<p>[July 13th, 2023 9:38 PM] rachel: hey both! thanks for replying here.. as per your question Joe, I would consider someone a software engineer if they know how to code - whether they have a CS degree, or did a bootcamp, or learned on their own. Someone who can code and build applications. I have no formal training in coding. However, I am excited about the potential of AI to help me make an app by generating code for me.</p>
<p>To answer your question Duncan - I've mostly been using a combination of asking chatGPT for the steps and code, and also using an app I am working on with a cofounder called Sublayer. We noticed that the chat interface is not really the best interface for building (and changing) complex apps, but we're still exploring the right workflow for it. Definitely eager to learn from this group how others are getting the best code generation out of the existing LLMs.</p>

<p>I've been thinking a lot about the patterns and architectures we're going to see start to emerge that lend themselves well to being written by generative AI and came across this technique being used by a library called Marvin (<a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/marvin">github.com/PrefectHQ/marvin</a>) where they limit the tokens the LLM can respond with to just a single token corresponding to a value in an enum. They then have it respond with the value as the response to a natural language query. This is extra interesting because responding with a single token is relatively fast and cheap.</p>
<p>The example they give is using it in routing:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">    USER_PROFILE = "/user-profile"

    SEARCH = "/search"

    NOTIFICATIONS = "/notifications"

    SETTINGS = "/settings"

    HELP = "/help"

    CHAT = "/chat"

    DOCS = "/docs"

    PROJECTS = "/projects"

    WORKSPACES = "/workspaces"





AppRoute("update my name")

# AppRoute.USER_PROFILE
</pre></div>

<p>But I feel like there's a seed of an idea here that points to what a piece of an LLM-core architecture may look like. I experimented with the idea a bit in chatgpt earlier today (screenshots attached) and I'd love to know if anyone finds this interesting or has any thoughts/opinions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Verse is a new programming language, being designed at Epic Games as the language of the metaverse. Verse is a functional logic language, with a bunch of innovative ideas. Like Haskell, Verse is declarative (a variable in Verse stands for just one, immutable value), and higher order (lambdas are first class). But Verse goes well beyond Haskell, with existential variables, unification, expressions that yield multiple values, and much more besides. In this talk we'll give you a sense of what functional logic programming is about, what it looks like to program in Verse, and how we can give meaning to Verse programs using rewrite rules.</p>

<p>I've added eval to my language in the last week. Trying to get my head around supercompilation so I can precompute terms that are evaled and then have typesafe  <code>string.format</code>  Does any language make use of this eval at compiletime to reduce untypable functions, like eval. </p>

<p>The execution of code, by its very nature, creates the conditions of a “strong legalism” in which you must unquestioningly obey laws produced without your say, invisibly, with no chance for appeal. This is a wild idea; today’s essay is packed with them. In drawing parallels between law and computing, it gives us a new skepticism about software and the effect it has on the world. It’s also full of challenges and benchmarks and ideas for ways that code can be reimagined. The conclusion of the essay is flush with inspiration, and the references are stellar. So while it might not look it at first, this is one of the most powerful works of FoC we’ve read.</p>

<p>Doesn't look like much. But under the hood it's a demo of an LLM-powered langchain agent using my Blawx software's public API to generate an answer based on a human-validated symbolic encoding, fully explainable with reference to source materials, and zero risk of hallucination. All of the usability upside of ChatGPT, none of the opacity and horseshit. It BARELY works with 3.5-turbo, some of the time. I need GPT4 API access to really generalize it, in addition to a few changes to Blawx to add natural language meta-data that can be used in prompts. If anyone has any tips on how to get access to GPT4 faster without breaking any laws, that'd be great.</p>

<p>I run into this fairly recent (sent 2017) patent that seems to just describe an incremental parser which is used to 'enrich' textual program code with syntactic and semantic annotations. I don't really understand what the patent tries to protect and what is supposed to be the patent worthy invention here as for example tree-sitter existed in 2017 already.

<p>I want to be able to post microblog style content, and have it cross-post to different platforms (e.g. Twitter, Mastodon, LinkedIn, Facebook) — in a way that is resilient to corporate api hijinx. (Perhaps aligned with the approach/philosophy of this project, getting into browser automation?  <a href="https://mschmitt.org/blog/save-liked-tweets-without-twitter-api/">mschmitt.org/blog/save-liked-tweets-without-twitter-api</a>.  Or this approach, <a href="https://www.parkerortolani.com/twoot">based on local device automation</a>?) I also think it would be cool to explore pulling content from multiple platforms and synthesizing them into a single alternative feed — sort of like an RSS for your Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Mastodon, Reddit timelines. Again, in a way that is resilient to corporate api hijinx.  Is anybody interested in exploring this?   I would also be interested in low-energy and low-data/bandwidth approaches to doing this, because that's the world we're moving towards (hopefully)</p>

<p>Hi all. I just finished listening to the episode, "Interpreting the Rule(s) of Code by Laurence Diver". I wasn't sure it was going to hook me, but am so glad it did. I had a few thoughts bounce around as I was listening, though dog-walking on a trail. Hopefully they make some sense now.</p>
<p>Where Ivan was talking about the problem of a program only being able to handle conditions for which it was designed, with no escape hatch, I wondered about exposing something like the restarts that Common Lisp has in its REPL. This probably isn't something you would offer to a user that you didn't trust with a REPL, but perhaps encountering a problem could default to selections of alternate solutions that are offered to the user. When restarts are offered in CL, the program execution is paused, so the choices for the user have all the context of what is on the stack at the time. Rather than just aborting (which is one option), one might take an extra step back and try something different. Web checkouts typically have a weak form of this, but I thought that perhaps very binary conditional checks could often be replaced with "one of" or combinations of options. Don't have that right address? (RR 2, Pfff!). Include some other means of providing a location that is accepted. Maybe some form of fuzzy logic, albeit unfashionable these days, guides the programmer into accepting a combination of responses that satisfy their fraud-prevention algorithm when taken together.</p>

<p>Also, the whole concern makes me think of the eventual corporate destination, "Computer Says No" from Little Britain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is part four of Debugging Lisp. Here are the previous parts on recompilation, inspecting, and class redefinition. The next post on miscellaneous debugging techniques can be found here.

<p>Say, has anyone ever tried BASIC's non-consecutive numbers for spreadsheet coordinates?</p>
<p>We programmers always laugh at spreadsheet's use of coordinates ("like machine code without assembly") but few users avail themselves of features to name ranges / structured/hierarchical data etc.</p>
<p>But there are real annoyances with what-you-see-is-what-you count consecutive coordinates:  They  <em>mostly</em>  shift correctly on insertions/deletions, BUT one needs to grok $A4 vs. B$7 notation, which I suspect many don't.  Getting range E3:F34 boundaries for formulas  <em>exactly</em>  right is always a hassle.</p>
<p>So I wonder if features like named ranges are "premature formalization" then maybe "structured numbers" in the BASIC's style could serve as more accessible "semi-formalization"?</p>
<p>BASIC users quickly learnt conventions like "increment by 10, start functions on hundreds, big modules on thousands".  And this allowed them to avoid re-numbering almost entirely!</p>
<p>(This was good UX in teletype line-editor era 🖨, and of course now we have full-screen editors and can insert/delete — no need to "increment from 10 to 20 so you can later insert 15".</p>
<p>But a 2nd aspect that imho was really genius was the numbers were  <em>stable</em> , helping your brain 🚲🧠.  Your transcript 📜 had partial  <code>LIST</code> ings, followed by chains of edit actions (poor man's git) + REPL experiments, and the fact that line 60 remains 60 throught helped you mentally interpret that history — making you a better debugging detective 🕵️‍♀️.  It's insane to remember what  <code>GOSUB 437</code>  means; easier if you  <em>assign</em>  semi-systematic round  <code>GOSUB 2100</code> .)</p>
<p>So, suppose spreadsheets let you use higher numbers/column names freely, by skipping display of unoccupied rows/columns.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a long table that might grow, you won't put  <code>=SUM(...)</code>  computation directly beneath it; you put it at next 100 or 1000 — but it will still display close to its bottom.  And you can type the range as  <code>10:99</code>  from the start.</li>
<li>With some foresight allocating "big enough" ranges for tables, you might never run into situations where  <code>$B7</code>  vs.  <code>B$7</code>  matters.  (This means spreadsheet should become smarter yet in renumbering on insert/delete — do shift rows/columns, but stop at next unoccopied "moat".)</li>
<li>To introduce users to the idea, don't show consecutive numbers/letters.  Even in an empty spreadsheet, after some rows/columns, skip to some far-away numbers like 100 and 1000!</li>
<li>Perhaps it might also subsume the feature of "freezing" some rows/column from scrolling?  mockup below has one fake "scrollbar" to suggest a portion could be scrolled separately.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm suddenly bothered by the fact that code comments are always the same  <em>size</em> .</p>
<p>Sure, I've seen some people play with rich text in their code editor, applying bold or font size the same way you apply color. Atom's CSS was great. But that's outside the code. Your font size tweaks aren't going in the repo. (That'd be a tabs vs spaces fight for the ages!)</p>
<p>But… what if I want to leave a little pocketbook tucked into the back flap of a function? Unobtrusive. It's there as a reference when you need it. Within, you can fully explain why things are the way they are. You can talk about the history of this code. It's the sort of stuff that you'd put into a wiki, or spread across a series of commit messages — but it's right there in the codebase,  <em>but</em>  it's tiny and off to the side. There when you need it, easy to ignore when you don't.</p>
<p>Makes me wonder about other ways that being able to choose the size of representation in a program — independently from typical size units of code (ie: lines) — could be useful. Eg: at the main entry point of a well-factored complex program, where you're dispatching off to various other subsystems, things deserve to be quite large.</p>
<p>Makes me wonder about other things that ought to live inside the codebase. To start: every feature of Github? (Consider that it serves their interests that, say, the discussion around an issue or PR lives on their cloud, not in the repo.)</p>

<p>Only halfway through the latest podcast ep but my imagination is piqued. Is there a version of, like, unit testing, where the software generates some randomized states based on its internal state and unknown inputs, presents the outcome as part of a report, and asks humans to correct any erroneous assumptions or missing contingencies? IDK how to even describe what I'm thinking of but I feel like it must exist, or maybe be theoretical in the emerging AI models of creating software.</p>
<p>Kind of fuzz testing, I guess. My brain is going somewhere bigger with this, though, maybe I'll check in with it again once I find time to finish the podcast.</p>

<p>Another thing. My wife worked at a legal research company for a while and she kept pausing the podcast (I subjected her to) to comment on the legal side of things. One thing she pointed out is that civil law is about codifying and interpreting laws to judge situations, but  <em>common law</em>  is basically a series of precedents. You try a case, if it's novel you invent a judgment. If it's similar to a previous case you adopt/adapt the previous judgment and it becomes a new more refined precedent for future situations.</p>
<p>Not sure the mapping here. I'm imagining when Ivan puts in his address to buy a ticket, instead of "invalid address" and end of story, the software responds, "this format of address is new to us, please await trial" and forwards it to the Airline Judge who renders judgment that is then encoded as precedent in the software itself.</p>

<p>The people using my software as a back-end for their web project are running machines that are not allowed to use docker, but are allowed to use "podman". Podman does not implement the feature of docker-compose.yml files that allows you to build an image from a github repository. So this week I need to learn how to publish docker images of my alpha software that nearly no one uses. Having users is the best/worst.</p>

<p>Hi everyone, I’ve been thinking about using hypertext instead of text files as the medium to represent programs  <em>and their executions</em> .</p>
<p>Programs contain a lot of cross references that are resolved only after the parser/runtime have had a go. IDEs also redo this parsing work to simulate the same cross references for easy editing. The idea is to embed these references in the medium itself. So, get rid of import statements, file boundaries and such. Each textual reference - function name, type name, any identifier really - would be link to the object it references. Unlike strongly structured environments, this allows some flexibility in representing partial and possibly invalid structures. I’m interested in implementations you know of that match this idea.</p>

<p>Recently, I realised that despite “vaguely knowing” what <a href="http://www.vpri.org/">VPRI</a> was doing (and trying to do), I never bothered to thoroughly read <a href="https://tinlizzie.org/IA/index.php/Papers_from_Viewpoints_Research_Institute">their reports and papers</a>. Now that I took the time to read them, I feel like overall it’s been time well spent (I got inspiration and encouragement for some projects).</p>
<p>I’d like to know if you know about the VPRI undertaking, and if you do, whether you read (some of) their papers/reports - see poll below. I’m also interested in similar experiences you had with other projects (thinking you know what they do, then having this understanding deepened by looking at their work more carefully).</p>

<p>My overall goal for the year is to —finally— learn how to do real work on the GPU. As a motivating short-term goal, I'm building a visualization of magnetic fields, as VFX for a video about regenerative braking that my company is producing. I'm doing all this (bear with me) inside a new drawing app that I'm developing, which heretofore rendered to SVG, but which I'd like to abstract so that it can render in a more API-agnostic way, as a prelude to making it portable (with an eye to Swift+Metal, perhaps eventually Vision Pro). Then (continue to bear with me) I'll have a nice foundation for continuing some of my visual programming experiments. So no, these screenshots here aren't  <em>strictly</em> FoC-relevant. But it is stuff that I'm building as a test case… within a new graphics tech stack that I'm building… with a goal of supporting some new visual programming stuff that I'd like to do.</p>
<p>I won't be posting much stuff here until it becomes more directly FoC relevant, but if you'd like to follow along regardless I'll be <a href="https://mastodon.social/@spiralganglion">posting more regularly on Mastodon</a>.</p>

<p>Aside: Magnetic fields are actually 4D phenomena (x/y/z/t).  We use equations to think about fields by reducing fields to 2D so that we may scribble our thoughts down onto clay tablets and papyrus.  There is this new medium - called “computers” - that might let us break free of 2D-only expression of 4D phenomena, using, say, 3D (x/y/t) while expressing the 4th D (z) using a trick that humanity invented, called “perspective”.  Fields might be more-than-4D phenomena but our brains can only perceive 4 dimensions at this time.</p>

<p>when you all work on a Future of Cod <em>ing</em>  flavored tool, do you think about ways to bake in certain sorts of interactions.</p>
<p><em>As example:</em> </p>
<p>React lets ya build accessible, localized experiences, but it also lets ya make something that is wholly inaccessible, too. It is sort of agnostic on that front. Could a tool “force” an accessible experience, or be more strongly biased towards something like that?</p>
<p>This line of thinking isn’t restricted to accessibility, it just seemed like an easy fruit to reach for when writing an example. Is this the kinda thing other folks think about when designing stuff? Do you have examples of it?</p>

<p>Generating initial content for an any workspace.</p>
<p><em>We are, by design, about non-linear explorations, in that setting it’s not always easy to start.</em> </p>
<p>A bit like sitting in front of a blank page. This feature is like priming / toning the canvas 😉</p>
<p>I personally think visually a lot of the time (spatially / moving pictures), but  <em>the</em>   <em>trigger for starting a thread of thought is quite often a word, term, phrase or a sentence</em> .</p>
<p>This feature is about that kind of exploration, you drop a word and it ripples out into all kinds of useful directions.</p>
<p>(of course, being useful is the trick here, this is very minimal atm)</p>
<p>The way the app is set-up it’s not difficult for us to generate those workspaces (the blocks are Clojure maps in a re-frame db), so if it turns out that it’s useful we’ll probably generate more content.</p>

<p>Not my main work, but a fun little programming project that's relevant in a number of ways, despite apparently being more about the Past of Coding, than the Future.</p>
<p>I wrote a small (&lt;500 lines of code) BASIC to JS compiler, that lets me run the programs from the class book <em>101 BASIC Computer Games</em> from 1978. It's interesting for two reasons I think: 1. for those who want to learn about languages and compilers, this provides a very simple example 2. philosophically, I think BASIC really exemplifies the Worse is Better approach outlined by  Richard Gabriel and covered in a FOC podcast. It is a terrible language in many ways, but it was small enough to be stored in a 4k ROM and be used to to useful things on an early microcomputer with only 4k of RAM. If we had waited for machines with enough memory to run Lisp, Smalltalk or Algol, the microcomputer revolution would have been delayed by a decade or more.

<p>To give some scope:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In asking “What is live coding?,” our intention is not to fix or define but rather to explore how live coding  <em>opens up</em> . Live coding is about people interacting with the world, and each other, in real time, via code. Live coding is about making software  <em>live</em> .</p>
<p>The first part is more practice focused, offering an account of the origins, development, and aspirations associated with the evolution of live coding alongside presenting documentation and examples of live coding practice. The second part is more speculative and conceptual in its register, allowing space for discussion of the many ways live coding reflects and informs wider cultural and political concerns.</p>

<p>This might fall under "thinking-together", but I'm throwing this here as it specifically relates to AI. For context, I've been working to integrate an LLM into an existing application.  If "prompt engineering" is part of the future of coding, here are some challenges to expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Non determinism:</em> I can repeat a prompt and get back drastically different results, in both content and format.</li>
<li>
<em>Capabilities:</em> I feel like I'm constantly probing to discover the capabilities and limits of the model. Every interaction is similar to being presented with a blank canvas: What should I ask? What can I ask? Is there something that I could ask that I am forgetting about? Can I reword my prompt slightly and (potentially) get better results? This leads to a lot of experimentation.</li>
<li>
<em>Expectations</em>: We are tricked into believing the LLM comprehends what we are saying, when it's really just a giant prediction table. Then we are disappointed when it gives less-than-satisfactory replies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Compare this to programming against a traditional API:</p>
<ul>
<li>On in the input side, an API constrains the vocabulary. With an LLM, everything is fair game.</li>
<li>On the output side, I can guess (or learn) the effect of a given API call. With an LLM, it's all probabilistic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Curious about others experiences here, ways to reason about these models, techniques for overcoming, etc...</p>

<p>HitchStory is an open source bolt-on for pytest that, lets you build integration tests which autogenerate scenario-based documentation about your app.</p>
<p>The tests are written in type-safe StrictYAML. In the website example, running the tests generates screenshots and a GIF of the user story from playwright. These are all combined into step-by-step markdown documentation that non developers can follow that explain how your app works.</p>

<p>I am going to need to come up with a more robust way to allow my users to edit legislative text in a way that is user friendly, and forces them to stick to a predefined data structure. I'm wondering if anyone has tried to use tools like slate.js or ProseMirror for that sort of thing, or have other suggestions. It's legislation, so I want the editing environment to be as text-like as I can manage.</p>

<p>Software Engineers do not write code.</p>
<p>Implementors (coders) write code.</p>
<p>Engineers think (deeply) about what code needs to be written, and, what trade-offs need to be made to simply make the system work.</p>
<p>Production Engineers think about making trade-offs so that the system is “efficient” along one or more dimensions (speed, space, cost, etc.), but, only after the initial system is working and shown to satisfy end-users’ needs.</p>
<p>Current popular programming languages, like Rust, Haskell, Python, etc., conflate all of these issues together, thus,  making the code more difficult to design.  Conflating issues together like this has a name: “cottage industry”.</p>
<p>Then, there’s Software Architecture, Maintenance, Testing, Q/A, Security, etc., etc.</p>
<p>The above pattern is visible in other, older professions, such as building construction.  Software might re-use these ideas and re-purpose them for creating electronic machines.</p>
<p>Note, too, that more-established professions use diagrams to augment the use of written words when communicating designs (blueprints, schematics, molecular diagrams, etc.).</p>
<p>Note, too, that more-established professions use elements that are completely isolated and decoupled from one another.  This assumption (of inherent non-coupling) is violated by most popular programming languages.</p>

<p>Lamdu now elaborates on non-trivial type errors!</p>
<p>In the screenshot several type errors are demonstrated:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple one: Text isn’t Num</li>
<li>“Occurs check”:  <code>func func</code>  means that the type of  <code>func</code>  is infinitely  <code>(((a -&gt; a) -&gt; a) -&gt; a) -&gt; …</code>  (note it can be done if wrapping in a nominal type to break the loop</li>
<li>Expand-record when inside record has the same fields. The message here isn’t yet very informative to which field is duplicated. Just says “constraints” for now</li>
<li>Scoped type variable escape (i.e “skolem”) error. This is equivalent to leaking Haskell’s  <code>ST</code>  monad’s  <code>s</code>  variable</li>
</ul>

<p>Just a small clip to show a stress test I've worked on for my new visual programming system.. maybe not super impressive, but at least it is performing better then my old system. It uses purely DOM, svg and css (transforms).</p>
<p>Creating all the nodes from javascript takes still quite long, they do all have different shapes though (using css clip-path).</p>

<p>I'm currently thinking about whether Product Managers (or other non-coder end users) can be able to make direct changes to native product without Engineers.  In the companies I've been at, there's been paper cuts and requests that engineers make to the product, which are time-consuming, tedious and take away from actual product/infra development.</p>
<p>If there are guardrails that Engineers define on certain parts of the product, are there any problems to this idea?  Curious what others think and/or have seen</p>

<p>I've been working on a specification for better, networked bookmarks.</p>
<p><em>A problem I'm currently facing:</em>  I share a lot of links. I have a channel on my Slack workspace called #walkers-claptrap where I share anything / everything that I find noteworthy. It's a bit like <strong>#linking-together</strong>. That said, not everyone I share bookmarks with (and short remarks about them) are at work, so I'm frequently duplicating and sharing over multiple lines of communication (texting, social media, slack, etc). Even then, those channels aren't easily traversed and are organized linearly. I don't love sorting things by date when their value isn't directly scoped to time. I'd also prefer to publish some place that I own and syndicate elsewhere, so that rules out Twitter.</p>
<p><em>semi-solution:</em> The claptrap specification. A graph of links / small notes. The edges are based on relationships or membership with some group. A claptrap MUST be hosted plaintext and MAY be accessed with curl or similar tool (sort of like Carmack's .plan files). A claptrap MAY expose an RSS of updates to syndicate to channels etc. A claptrap MAY reference external claptrap nodes to network / branch beyond the local graph.</p>
<p>Still very much a work in progress. Does anyone have a similar problem; do you have a solution you like? I want to bridge the gap between "personal knowledge base" and "sharing links into the ether"</p>

<p>I wonder if anyone has tried to use Rosie as a replacement for grep?</p>
<p>IMO, the problem with grep is that it based on regular expressions, whereas PEG is more powerful.  My favourite PEG is Ohm-JS but I am curious about Rosie...</p>

<p>Hey all! I need a tool / stack suggestion. We'd like to track internal metrics for development like build performance stats, build size, source control size, etc. I'd like to be able to see these trends in a graph by date/commit.</p>
<ul>
<li>CI tools can do some of this, but they only surface a small, inconfigurable set of metrics. Usually just test failures and build times.</li>
<li>There are monitoring solutions like Grafana Cloud, Datadog, but these all seem geared towards monitoring servers and cloud systems. They also assume you're ingesting massive amounts of data.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I really just want is a POST-able URL that I can spit metrics to, and a dashboard with some basic alerting. Is there something like this that exists?</p>

<p>Attending a conference today and yesterday about Blockly, the visual code editing environment. Big push toward bi-drectionality between code and blocks. For integration with existing code-bases, AI generation, collaboration with people not using visual editors, etc. At least two different approaches being investigated or used, and I would be inclined to use a completely different one. They don't realize it, but some of their problems are solved by some of the tools people here are working on. Like how do you make it so that you can generate blocks when the text is in an invalid state? Much easier to just avoid invalid states, like Blockly does! How can you avoid invalid states if the person isn't finished typing, and there are mandatory subnodes in the AST? Much easier to fill holes by default, like Blockly does. Essentially, they can't get to bidirectionality, because the text editing experience is structurally unaware. It's not possible with VSCode, but it is possible with Tylr, or anything that imposes a structure. Even ProseMirror would work better. But there is no need to stop at two concrete syntaxes, if you can sacrifice interface specific details (e.g. whitespace in text, grid position in Blockly), or keep them where they live (linter settings, a database of block locations outside the AST), you can operate directly on the AST in whatever tool you want. Has anyone played with a "headless" AST that could be used that way? It feels like all structural editors need one, particularly if they hope to facilitate collaborative editing. Has anyone tried putting two different coding interfaces over the same shared AST?</p>

<p>Addendum to the above, <a href="https://dynamicland.org/docs/2023-04-27-Communal-computing-for-21st-century-science.pdf">this PDF</a> on the Dynamicland site. Starts with a bang.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nobody asked for the invention of the graphical user interface. It wasn’t on any national research agenda. There was no demand from users — they were a small cadre of professionals using computing for specialized technical tasks, and accepted command-driven textual interfaces as simply what it meant to use a computer. There was no demand from the public — most people never expected to touch a computer in their lives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concepts around directly manipulating information arranged spatially on a screen were invented unbidden by a small group of visionaries, particularly in the research groups of Doug Engelbart and Alan Kay in the 1960s and 1970s. They believed that computing could be more than just number crunching, that it could serve as a medium for all people to see and discuss ideas, if only those ideas could be represented in visible, manipulable forms.</p>
<p>I haven't read the rest of the PDF yet, but it looks to go into a fair bit more detail about their vision for the "21st Century Science Lab" than what was hinted at in the video.</p>

<p>Alright, so we have the above  <em>visionary</em>  approach to spatial computing where you can actually touch and feel the computable things, your body is fully present in the computable space — assuming the dream comes true and it ever takes off — versus the now all-too-inevitable <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/">Vision</a> where you don't even get to <a href="http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/">touch glass</a>, your body is so absent that they have to make a <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/metahuman">meta human</a> out of you. Here's hoping the latter doesn't take the wind out of the sails of the former.</p>
<p>I'm curious to see what sorts of programming tools Apple has come up with for Vision. I'm assuming it'll be the same old Swift, SwiftUI, and Xcode (now in a spatial window), but maybe there'll be some hint of novelty in Reality Composer Pro or some other accessory tooling. But I'm far, far more interested in seeing what we all can come up with.</p>

<p>Does anyone have suggestions for a snapshot history UX for multi-dimensional data (like Excel, but with more dimensions)? It seems that most implementations for Figma, Google Workspace, and Microsoft Office 365 are pretty basic, but maybe that’s all people expect, so it’s not worth the effort to try to be clever. What do others think? I’d be pretty curious for people to suggest products which were able to “double count” the typical “snapshot” UX by thoughtfully pairing it with another need like audit-ability. For example: Procreate has a way to see the timelapse of changes to a piece of art over time. Or, you could use snapshots as a way to tell a story with data, by selecting interesting snapshots to be used as “key frames” in a presentation.</p>

<p>I finally had occasion to try out Obsidian today. Some notes after 5 minutes of use.</p>
<ul>
<li>The initial experience is a blank screen without bullets. I thought the outliner view was the #1 selling point of such tools? Do people use Obsidian to write free-form text?</li>
<li>I can copy a set of nested bullets from Obsidian to LogSeq and it works great. In the other direction, though, Obsidian loses all the nested structure I copied from LogSeq.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall the experience has been surprising. The open source clone felt like a more polished onboarding experience than the relatively proprietary and centrally coordinated product. I'm curious if that matches other people's experience.</p>

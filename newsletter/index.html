<p>A few years after I started programming I used to spend lots of free time tweaking my editor and shell configuration. After many years, I find I'm back to doing that 😕, only I then spend a few hours every few days trying to write up my configuration for imaginary others. This most recent post I'd never have gotten around to if I'd known how much proof-reading it would take.</p>

<p>I've taken a short break from my language, debugger, and editor to program my digital chess board (Chessnut air). I've been trying to learn/get better at chess for a while now and thought a digital chess board would be a great way to practice away from the computer. It is, except 1) bots don't play like people 2) the apps for the board suck. If fixed the first by using <a href="https://maiachess.com/">maiachess.com</a> a chess bot trained on Lichess data to play like real people (it's impressive). I also had to whip up a custom openings book. And 2 by writing my own software for the board. The bluetooth protocol was surprisingly simple (and luckily someone already reverse engineered it for me).</p>
<p>I think the most fun part about all of this has been building an interface in the chess board itself, rather than in an app. My program has no ui other than the chess board. Want to play a game as black, setup up the pieces, and pick up the black king. The game will start when you place it down. Setup a similar setup for choosing a unique starting position. The UI has changed everything for me. I use it now way more since I don't have to mess with an annoying app on my phone.</p>

<p>I think this should be quite natural to do since looking at the code for <a href="https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/stream/stream-graphs.html">Akka GraphDSL</a> - it’s already pretty close to a visual language. </p>

<p>calculang is a language for calculations, It aims to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>shareable, communicable 💬 💌</li>
<li>transparent, verifiable 🕵️‍♀️</li>
<li>understandable, concise 📖</li>
<li>flexible, reusable ♻</li>
</ul>
<p>only for calculations ⇔ numbers ⇔ workings</p>
<p>calculang doesn’t ‘do things’ (“side-effects”) like regular programming languages 💥</p>
<p>This serves to simplify, permitting the aims above for  <em>calculations, numbers,</em>  and their  <em>workings</em>  ✅️</p>

<p>Help papa find her daughter</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My child is 3 years old. I was looking for a game that we could play together and would be her first programming-like activity. I wasn’t keen to teach her anything specifically but rather offer her the option to explore what coding or algorithmic thinking tasted like (similarly when you would give your child a sheet of paper, brush, and paint to play with). I evaluated some computer game options but I wished to find screen-free, unplugged alternatives, especially since she has not been used to interact with a computer or screen at all.</p>

<p>I started all this by saying PPLs were surprisingly visual and physical, so I'm concentrating on the interaction loop that I had in mind when I said those things: every time you edit a program, you see how it affects the distributions of data flowing through.</p>
<p>So in the attached GIF, there's a dataflow graph for a simple model where every few seconds I add an additional wire.</p>
<p>PPLs don't solve for a result—they  <em>converge</em> . So I expected the visualizations to have a very springy response to changes. And that's what I get! In fact, the juiciness of the program output contrasts so much with the stilted UI that I might have to resubscribe to some game design blogs sooner than later. 😬</p>
<p>But this is good. I have ideas for where to take the language that are milquetoast but implementable by me in my spare time, at a pace that I think should allow me to explore complex models within my lifetime.</p>

<p>I haven't been doing much coding lately (past ~4 months), so I'm doing a tiny side project to test out some new ways of working.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm converting an old CLJS project to TypeScript. I really wanted to authentically  <em>live in</em>  CLJS, but after months and months of trying, I never got over pain caused by the tooling. (This was back in ~2016, and I hear things have come a long way since. I'd give it another shot, but I no longer have much free time to learn languages/ecosystems.) I tried to get GPT to actually just convert the whole CLJS codebase. It was a mixed success. This is why I chose TypeScript, rather than (my preference) some dynamically-typed language. As it passes through an intentional state of  <em>chaotic mush</em> , I want as much  <em>structure</em>  as possible to be imposed upon my work. Once the conversion is done and I'm ready to resume work on the actual capabilities of the system, I'll probably gradually convert it to JS so that I can get away from needing a build step at all.</li>
<li>Inspired by <strong>@Maggie Appleton</strong>, I'm using native apps for Whisper and GPT. When I want to know how to do something, I just ramble out loud. Eg: "Does JavaScript have any syntax yet for iterating over the keys and values of an object without using object.entries?" I've found that for certain kinds of question, it feels really fluid. It might not be any faster than switching to my browser, typing <a href="http://mdn.io">mdn.io</a> followed by my query, and then scanning the page. But it often is, and even when it isn't it just feels really nice to get some help from the computer without having to touch the keyboard. (I have a weird relationship with my sense of touch — for instance, I really dislike touching anything made of metal and think we need to put all the metal back in the ground where it belongs, we've awoken a demon of unhindered conduction and are reaping the consequences, we're all damn fools — so it's nice to be able to converse directly with my computer without having to touch anything)</li>

<p>I've resigned myself to the fact that models in my language are going to get worse before they get better. There are things I love about this representation already, but I can already see it getting mired in "syntax".</p>
<p>I'll get to it. I want to work on model  <em>editing</em>  so badly that I'm just throwing in first drafts of the language features that I need in order to implement more interesting models as quickly as possible. I'm only a few away.</p>
<p>I added new entries in the lab notebook about <a href="http://alltom.com/pages/ppl-lab-notebook/003.html">why</a> and <a href="http://alltom.com/pages/ppl-lab-notebook/004.html">how</a>, and created this lovely GIF for you. This is a "trait attribution" model that infers whether an exam is fair based on an assumption about the base rate of exams being fair, and how many people pass. (Only one person took this particular test—and they failed. 😰) Cute and small.</p>

<p>Trying to see what I can do with the relational model, only supporting multi-model. Tagging each row of tables with a “model” identifier, much as temporal databases attach an interval or whatever to a row.</p>
<p>This would be give us a First Order Modal logic. I could have some fund pondering what various modal logics can do here (I’ve studied Modal Logic, but not recently). It occurred to me to ask about existing work in the area. At least what the concept is called, so I can go look for prior art.</p>
<p>Think of having a Datalog database and being able to set a “current model” or being able to do separate parts of queries in different models.</p>
<p>I’m also interested in the idea of merging multiple models to build new ones.</p>
<p>What should I look for?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFga2bfptBk">in this video</a> I show the progress on a new feature that I really wanted for quite some time: combining nodes into reusable compositions. This helps in making flows smaller. The compositions can be accessed from within the node-type selector so they can be added to the flow. One thing that I really like is how the inputs and outputs to compositions are created based on the connections which cross the bounds of the selected area. I've also finally added a way to copy &amp; paste nodes which is a nice productivity improvement. </p>
<p>In the video I demonstrate my other flow engine instance with which you can create fragment shaders in webgl and here I've recreated a shader form shadertoy made by kishimisu (see <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/mtyGWy">shadertoy.com/view/mtyGWy</a> ). I had to extend the node-types to make this possible. Currently I cant yet create nested compositions but once that is possible I hope it will help decrease the "node-spaghetti" further. Because I do think that the textual shadertoy code is still easier to read then my visual version. Which obviously I want to improve. </p>
<p>I am almost ready to send out a link to my visual editor but decided to work on it a little bit more for ar least this month. I want to extend and improve some features and create more example flows.</p>

<p>🗨️ Software Craftsmanship: The New Imperative via <strong>Dave Liepmann</strong></p>

<p>Pete McBreen's  <em>Software Craftsmanship: The New Imperative</em>  (2002).</p>
<p>Most of the book is about the consequences of distinguishing between "software engineering" (defined as armies of programmers going down a waterfall) and "software craftsmanship" (defined as small teams working incrementally). He runs deep with the craftsman metaphor, taking seriously how to make real the "apprentice" and "journeyman" stages in a software developer's career.</p>
<p>One interesting thread is that he points out how "best practices" are firmly a creation of the software engineering side of his binary, and do not satisfy craftspeople's very different trade-offs. Some by nature will wind around on their own path, custom-fitting each architectural decision to their preferences and the needs of the specific project.</p>
<p>There is overlap with our <a href="posts/future-of-coding-weekly-202402-week-2/?fromDate=2023-12-27&amp;toDate=2024-01-02&amp;channel=thinking-together&amp;filter=#2023-12-30T13:04:55.921Z">💬 #thinking-together@2023-12-30</a>, exploring <a href="https://twitter.com/jackrusher">Jack Rusher</a>'s ontology of [programming, computer science, software engineering]. It seems useful to me to further distinguish the "strong S.E." that Jack and McBreen use as definitional from the "soft S.E." which we all seem to use colloquially to mean all manner of techniques for making an application error-resistant. The work of the latter may not be intellectually engaging or novel but it lacks the qualities which make strong SE distasteful: centralization of power, treating developers interchangeably, the urge towards monoculture, a cultural belief in "training" instead of learning.</p>

<p>I'm  <em>looking for the first team member</em>  for a natural language programming startup I've been working on since the beginning of 2021: <a href="https://levlo.com">levlo.com</a>.</p>
<p>The responsibilities can be defined based on experience and interests to fit somewhere between passionate frontend developer + designer and full-stack developer + product owner/chief product officer.</p>
<p>I live in Espoo, Finland, but we'd work mostly full-remote. However, due to bureaucracy, residence in Finland is required. Atm I have funding for 12 months of 4200€/month salary (with working time and benefits as defined by Finnish law) and will be offering equity on top. The goal is certainly to find funding for paying the salary going forward as well.</p>
<p>Since releasing the demo shown on the site, I've been working on rewritting large parts of the underlaying technology to be able to add features required by potential use-cases that have come up. Now, after ~5 months, I've finally been able to start adding those language features and start work towards enabling real world use-cases. Sales effort hase been fairly minimal so far, but I have one confirmed pilot customer (B2B) and will be putting more effort into sales going forward.</p>
<p>The techstack is C#, Azure and Blazor (similar to Vue). The most important skills would be web frontend development (&amp; design), cloud (Azure), and C#. In that order. The C# you'll need to write will be fairly trivial and it should be easy for anyone familiar with eg. Java or TypeScript to pick it up. But first and foremost I'm looking for someone passionate about the future of programming willing to embark on this hopefully decades long journey with me!</p>

<p>My PhD thesis about my ongoing attempts to marry AI and HCI is now up. (A lot of it is about academia, where those two fields  <em>do not like</em>  to talk.) Plenty of stuff about paper tools, rapid visualization prototyping, and the connection between domain-specific languages and direct-manipulation interfaces.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Author(s): Otto, Jasmine Tan | Advisor(s): Smith, Adam M | Abstract: Software instruments are intelligent interfaces used by domain experts to manipulate complex artifacts. By contributing the concept of software instruments, this thesis connects the field of data visualization to its relations in both artificial intelligence and computer-supported collaborative work. Software instruments arise from projects carried out by teams with complex datasets in aerospace and narrative design, whom I have worked closely with, and which are developed and documented in this thesis. They are a lens for other computational media practitioners to introspect about their own design processes and artifacts. I argue that the evaluation of software instruments occurs in discussion with expert stakeholders, adopting the lens of critical technical practice to avoid disciplinary silos and narrow strategies of evaluation.</p>

<p>We just open sourced this concept we've been working on for programming with LLMs we're calling Blueprints. It is kind of an alternative to coding copilots. It allows you to capture patterns/sections/chunks/classes/etc of your code to store as a "blueprint" then use those blueprints as a base template for generating something new - in your particular style. Think about it similarly to how when you work on a new feature, a lot of the time there's similar code in your codebase that you look at and modify for this new use case you're working on.</p>
<p>The way it works is that when you capture a blueprint, the server generates a description with GPT4 along with vector embeddings of that description so that the next time you want to do something you just need to describe it, it finds the closest description, and uses the description+code to prompt for the new code generation.</p>
<p>Would love feedback or to chat if this sounds interesting to anyone!</p>

<p>Hey y'all. I'm working towards a library for rendering and adding direct-manipulation to infinite recursive things. I want to share this picture showing where I'm at.</p>
<p>On the left is the rendered infinite recursive thing. On the right is the diagrammatic specification for the thing on the left. The library interprets the diagrammatic spec and produces a program that takes the initial transformation (position, rotation, scale, and skew) of a shape (data for a  <code>t</code>  in the diagram), and then runs forever, adding more shapes to the left and the right as it runs.</p>
<p>The arrows in the spec mean "depends on", and the lines mean "depends on" both ways. I could have drawn the lines as two-sided arrows but I found that it was harder to read. Explaining this now I realize its kind of confusing tho lol.</p>
<p>The self-loop on the  <code>t</code>  in the spec is what makes the resulting diagram recursive, otherwise it would be a single red, green, and blue thing.</p>
<p>Currently the diagrammatic spec is actually specified in text 😐</p>

<p>Just curious for all your thoughts, is being ahead of your time a good thing? I’m thinking of a conversation I had with <strong>@Toby Schachman</strong> in the Cuttle discord a while back where he mentioned that Cuttle aimed certain details at a status-quo of programming style unlike it’s predecessor Apparatus, I thought that was quite profound. I’m thinking also of Fortran vs Lisp (or perhaps Forth). When is it  <em>not</em>  worth it to meet people where they are?</p>

<p>I wanted to bounce 2 terms I've been thinking of off of this group:</p>
<p>I dig visual programming, but think the term is like a little bit of a brain poison because it isn't really descriptive of the goals, and, like, almost all textual programming is inherently visual, too...just...in the way text is.</p>
<p>I think <a href="http://ivanish.ca/">Ivan Reese</a> was the person I first heard float the term "spatial programming," which I dig, but at least for me, it also misses the real value add of what I'm looking for in a "visual" system.</p>
<p>So, the two terms I've been kicking around:</p>
<ul>
<li>relational programming</li>
<li>cartographic programming</li>
</ul>
<p>Neither are perfect, and both feel exhaustingly pretentious (a good thing, may haps?) but my intention with both terms is to highlight that these sorts of systems, unlike text-based programming, help make the relationships between different elements (classes, data flow, inheritance, etc.) meaningful using information other than similar names.</p>
<p>Useful? Stupid? Prior art?</p>

<p>made a simple tool to publish Apple Reminders online <a href="http://public.me/">public.me</a>.</p>
<p>Sounds not impressive, but Apple Reminders gave me an interesting data structure: list of items with predefined format(name, description, date, url, isCompleted, images etc).</p>
<p>So I was able to build habits tracker directly in reminders and have nice visualizations of streaks like this <a href="https://public.me/anton/daily">public.me/anton/daily</a></p>

<p>I see lots of folks here are interested in the intersection of programming and AI (to say little); I finally posted an example combining Unit and LLMs on X. It is a reactive graph for text reasoning and image generation. I start from a statement, then apply commands to transform it, ultimately rendering generated images. <a href="https://twitter.com/io_sammt/status/1748683055605195087?s=46&amp;t=kvyalr_gJlbdW-jQJstTcg">Take a look </a>.

<p>When working on my language I've been frustrated by the lack of symbols and extra information for my JIT compiled code. There is a way to get this kind of information, but it involves building an elf binary in memory. Way too much overhead for this point in my development.</p>
<p>So I started building my own debugger frontend to lldb. Not much to show right now. But the idea is to specifically tailor it to my language. So you'll get a compiler explorer like experience, but also be able to view the stack and heap and all of that live. See the language level values stored in there.</p>
<p>The fun part to for me was how to convey the information I need to the debugger. The answer came from the standard JIT interface. How do you tell your debugger things? You make a function that the debugger has a breakpoint in. The function does nothing in the body. You just pass some args that tells the debugger where in memory to get the information it needs. Super clever. So now I'm working on passing all my compiler metadata to the debugger frontend so it can know how to render things intelligently.</p>

<p><img alt="Youtube Thumbnail" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/ApOfXliyGqc/hqdefault.jpg"></p>
<p>This week I spend a lot of time adding basic keyboaed support in the visual programming system that I am developing. For productivity I think that just using a mouse for creating a visual flow is not enough. One of the reasons why we are so productive when using a text editor for programming is the usage of the keyboard I think. Off course it's not the only reason but I do think it's of major influence. </p>
<p>So being able to use the keyboard for visual programming seems like a very good idea. In <a href="https://youtu.be/ApOfXliyGqc">this video</a> I show exactly that.</p>
<p>Currently after every update to the flow, the tabindex is set on all the nodes and input elements. In normal webapps this is not a good idea, but here it is the only way to give the browser the proper and logical tab order. When tabbing through the flow, the camera is focused on the selected node overriding default browser scroll-behavior when a focused element is out of the current view. Using ctrl+a you can add a new node and also select the thumbs for the connection.  </p>
<p>Furthermore I've added some other features like being able to run a flow using the keyboard (ctrl + Enter) and opening the properties popup. A missing feature is being able to add a new node before the currently selected node.</p>
<p>Lots of small tweaks were needed to make this work, but I am glad I spend the time because this also increases the accessibility.</p>

<p><a href="http://ivanish.ca/">Ivan Reese</a>, in episode 9 of a podcast I can’t tell if I’m supposed to know about or not, you asked, “Where is [data] going when you’re throwing it away, and when you rewind, how does it come back?” And I don’t think it has answers that you’d want to apply directly to your situation, but  ~<em><em>Feynman’s Lectures on Computing</em></em>~  comes back to the idea of reversible computing again and again with various playful metaphorical lenses. I think that at the very least it might be a nice way to take a break and think about the problem from a physicist’s perspective now and then, if this is still a problem you’re working on.</p>

<p>I’ve been really into probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) lately. I had a few “aha” moments and I’m decidedly in the “hit everything with this hammer to figure out where the nails are” phase.</p>
<p>Anyway, is anybody here in a similar headspace? Or already experienced with PPLs?</p>
<p>Is anybody curious to enter this headspace with me? I reviewed the (online, free, programmable) book that brought me here: <a href="https://micro.alltom.com/2024/01/11/the-cognition-in.html">micro.alltom.com/2024/01/11/the-cognition-in.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The “Cognition” in Probabilistic Models of Cognition 📚 is the hardest part to get across when I recommend this book. Because the book isn’t “Bayes works, yawn.” It’s so much more interesting if you, like me, exist primarily in ML circles that focus on curve-fitting:

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/glFRPjWWlzA">In this video</a>  I show a timeline slider with which you can scroll through the executed path of a visual flow program. Some node-types like variables and the node-tree-visualizer have there state being recorded for each execution.. so when moving through the timeline, these nodes are updated and especially with the node-tree-visualizer this gives a good overview of how a program/algorithm works (in this case quicksort). Instead of having to visualize this in your head , you see the effect of the program for each execution step and you can also inspect the variables like the left and right arrays and the pivot variable.</p>
<p>On the end of this month I hope to release a demo version of the project I am working on, so the last weeks I've also been fixing bugs and making other improvements. One of the bigger improvements is the way the moving message bubble is handled, it's now much smoother especially on lower execution speeds because of the use of requestAnimationFrame, it was on my wishlist from the beginning I implemented this but hadn't come around to it yet. </p>

<p>I was inspired by <a href="http://www.inference.org.uk/dasher/">Dasher</a>, which uses the low entropy of natural language to make it possible to enter text using only a 1-dimensional input device. The core idea is to make the most likely next input take up a lot of space and thus make it easy to reach.</p>
<p>Most interactions we have with a computer involve low entropy input.</p>
<p>With (1) good models, and (2) a lossy encoding/decoding model that is easy for humans to use, you should be able to get away with entering a lot less.</p>
<p>For code, LLMs are pretty powerful models. And fuzzy matching is a pretty easy-to-use lossy encoding model.</p>

<p>I really like TodePond's video "Screens in Screens in Screens". I've been wanting to do the same kinda thing with mathematical formulas instead of shapes, a kind of "formulas in formulas in formulas", but I'm an awful programmer so I'll describe some math you can do to that effect. Apologies in advance for the shoddy explanation though.</p>
<p>Here's a thing you can do with "screens". You can name screens. Start with some screens A B C. Then if C is inside A, and A and B are the same color, then there is a copy of C inside B. What do you call this copy? "The copy of B from A to C"? It will be convenient if we give it a symbolic name. Call it (A-&gt;B)C. Or if you are really hardcore you can call it just t(A,B,C) where t is a ternary operator describing the result of copying C from A to B. You may think to only consider (A-&gt;B)C when C is inside A, but the math becomes tractable if you consider all screens at once. Then we can stipulate some axioms:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>(A-&gt;A)B = B</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(A-&gt;B)A=B</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(B-&gt;C)(A-&gt;B)=(A-&gt;C)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(A-&gt;(X-&gt;Y)A)=(X-&gt;Y)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first axiom means if you are copying a screen from one screen to itself, you aren't changing anything. The second axiom is "obvious" except for considering (A-&gt;B)A in the first place. The third axiom means if you copy a screen from A to B and then from B to C that is the same as if you were to copy it from A to C directly. It is also shorthand for (B-&gt;C)((A-&gt;B)D) = (A-&gt;C)D for all screens D. The fourth axiom takes a bit more explaining. Basically we want this equation to be true whenever A is in X, and both sides are being used to copy something from A. But our theory at this point doesn't have a predicate for "A is contained in X" so we say it holds in all cases.</p>
<p>With these axioms you can show the operators (A-&gt;B) form an algebraic structure called a group: You can multiply them by performing one copy after the other (C-&gt;D)(A-&gt;B). This operation is associative (I mean, it must be), and has an identity element and inverses. The identity being (A-&gt;A) and the inverse of (A-&gt;B) being (B-&gt;A).</p>
<p>Another perspective is to view screens as points in an affine space (i.e. vector space without a specified origin). Then (A-&gt;B)C can be thought of as (B-A)+C, and each of the axioms above can be interpreted as vector equations. This isn't a good model though because it ends up saying some screens are the same when they should be different. You can still take the above axioms and show that screens form a generalization of affine spaces called torsors.</p>
<p>I'll share more if anybody is interested. It really needs a much longer write up, but I thought somebody might know if its already been done before.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I started a new series of blog posts (or “newsletters”, in Substack parlance) about  <em>simplicity</em> :</p>
<p>1 • <a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/on-simplicity">On simplicity</a> introduces the series with how my thinking about simplicity has changed over the years.</p>
<p>2 • <a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/on-simplicity-2-meaning-ful-design">Meaning-ful design</a> connects simplicity to meaning making and coherence.</p>
<p>3 • <a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/on-simplicity-3-familiarity">Familiarity</a> explores how complex things can be surprisingly simple and why we can’t ignore context.</p>
<p>4 • <a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/on-simplicity-4-reciprocal-realization">Reciprocal realization</a> frames design as a complex dynamic process of mutual adaptation between designer and designed object.</p>
<p>…  <em>I expect about four or five more posts coming after that, but I haven’t written them yet, so I have no idea.</em> 🙂</p>
<p>A lot of this draws on 4E cognitive science, design theory, and philosophy. As such it may perhaps be less technical than you would expect it to be, although I try much harder in this series to relate it more directly to programming and software development than in <a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/previously-a-recap">my last</a>.</p>
<p>And that’s why I post it here, today. I’m hoping to learn if this resonates at all with a technical audience, or if this is still too abstract. I know we’re all craving for the easily applicable  <em>Top 10 Things to Make Things Simple</em>  (and number 6 will surprise you), but I have reason to believe that it’s just not that… well… simple. But I think I’m slowly making progress towards synthesizing something valuable, even if I can’t express it as beautifully as I would like to. Yet.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think, and please ask any questions you may have (in thread or via DM). Appreciate your feedback!</p>

<p>Spinners are boring, so might as well get creative with AI UX for loading states, even with fast LLMs like Mixtral.</p>
<p>The thinking is to not only show multiplayer presence on our canvas, but also what the AI is doing and working on, including visualizing the code its writing in real-time.</p>

<p>I think I have a usable app development experience now on my tablet. I basically took my recent Lua Carousel and made a few changes. In Carousel (first clip) you start in the programming environment, each screen runs a separate script, scripts run in the background of the editor, and each screen manages its own canvas. The new setup (second clip) starts in the app, which takes over the entire device until I 'exit' into the programming environment. In the programming environment, screens are now just editors with a shared 'run' button and canvas. Hopefully I can now finish polishing this  ~turd~  app entirely on the tablet.</p>

<h2>Thinking Together</h2>
<p>💡  Communicating programming ideas by <a href="http://ivanish.ca/">Ivan Reese</a></p>
<p><a href="https://history.futureofcoding.org/history/weekly/2024/01/W2/thinking-together.html#2024-01-01T21:17:17.966Z">🧵 conversation</a></p>
<p>Someone reached out to ask me for more thoughts about communicating programming ideas through media other than the academic paper. I wrote a reply, and then decided it would be worth sharing here to see if other folks have their own inspirations they'd like to share, or ideas for how our industry can go  <em>paper-free</em>  ;)</p>
<hr>
<p>I feel like I owe reading an apology. I certainly try to play up my "crank" side on the podcast, but it does run the risk of mixing-up  <em>this is being silly</em> with  <em>this is thoughtful critique</em> .</p>
<p>I have tremendous reverence for the communicative potential of the written word. I just think there are some kinds of ideas that lend themselves better to other forms of expression, or some ideas that can't be written down.</p>
<p>For instance, it's very strange to me whenever I read a paper about HCI, especially if they're discussing GUI ideas. Sure, often these papers will be accompanied by a video. But, like, the work being described is about  <em>interacting with interfaces</em> . I think the work should be presented as an interface you can interact with!</p>
<p>I'm especially fond of <a href="http://worrydream.com">Bret</a>'s essays, naturally. <a href="https://ciechanow.ski">Bartosz</a> also does great work with visualization, though I feel like he leans a little too heavily on text and that the visualizations are too linear. <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com">Amit</a> also does excellent work, but he has the advantage that most of the things he demos are inherently about interactive graphics so they lend themselves naturally to this sort of presentation (not to diminish the incredible effort Amit puts in to these articles).</p>
<p>The thing I want to see more of is… people finding ideas that can  <em>only</em>  be expressed through interaction. I think successfully achieving this requires that someone work natively in interaction, a lot, for a long time. As a result, most of these ideas seem to emerge in the periphery of video games.</p>
<p>One of my favourite examples is <a href="https://w.itch.io/dys4ia">Dys4ia</a>, a collection of microgames about the trans experience. It uses written language and (meaningfully crude) visual art to set up the  <em>plot</em> , but interaction to tell the  <em>story</em> .</p>
<p>Something I'm very interested in seeing (and have made a few attempts at myself, but nothing worth sharing) is an attempt to create a fully-usable programming environment  <em>presented as a game</em>  specifically for the purpose of communicating ideas about programming. There've been plenty of the inverse, where a programming system is the setting within which a game takes place (see all the works of <a href="http://zachtronics.com">Zachtronics</a>, for instance), but I haven't seen anyone do a game as the setting within which actual programming takes place. Closest to that might be something like Minecraft or Dreams (etc), but I don't think those were designed to communicate ideas about programming the way, say, The Witness was designed to communicate a philosophy of science.</p>
<p>Another close comparison might be Advent of Code, where you playfully approach programming differently than in your normal work. The programming you do for AoC should feel meaningfully different. Similarly, imagine building your own Rosetta Code from scratch. That should give you a really particular feeling. I think it's related to, say, the feeling of writing a rasterizer for the dozenth time. I think these feelings are ideas, and that there's a whole language of them, and that the language is expressed through the creation of systems. I think if we studied this language, it would guide us toward building different kinds of tools.</p>
<p>And hell, you might eventually be able to write a paper about that. (Countdown to someone arguing that this is what Christopher Alexander has made a career of, in a sense.) But I don't think we will arrive at those system-feeling ideas in any way other than by building and playing with systems, and with a particular intention at that.</p>

<p>Heya internetpeoples ❤ I’ve spent a long time refining this and brought in “The LLMs” to help craft the tone here, and I think I’ve finally gotten it to a point where I feel like it hits my message and question, and doesn’t assume too much negativity or… doomcalling, heh. Thanks for the time and shared space, as always.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’ve despaired when stuck on problems I just couldn’t crack. I’ve also felt the joy of those “aha!” moments when things finally click. We’ve all been there as coders. While documentation and searches can help fill gaps, little replaces another human sitting alongside, guiding with patience earned from experience. In those moments when someone more seasoned gave guidance, I felt hope renewed. How might we foster more of these vital human connections?</p>
<p>Key Discussion Points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Knowledge flows when passion meets patience</em> . I’m grateful for the patient coders who “reached down” to guide me. Let’s discuss barriers hampering these relationships. Generalizations about certain groups being “unwilling” to help are counterproductive. However, empathetic mentorship remains scarce. How might we change incentives?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Truly supporting newcomers requires understanding their frustrations are valid. I want to open a thoughtful discussion on constructive ways we can keep improving in this regard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are always exceptions by those dedicated to lifting others up. But much room remains for improving access, channels and incentives for more direct peer sharing across experience levels. It’s on each of us to reflect on where we can have an impact.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I welcome reactions, shared experiences, and dialogue toward that aim. How might we strengthen coder communities through human connections? Where do you see the biggest opportunities? Together, I believe we can guide positive change.</p>

<p>I ran across <a href="https://cassette-lang.com/">Cassette</a>, a programming language today. I liked some of the stuff on the webpage and think it is interestingly aligned with the Future of Coding community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I made Cassette as a simple language for “playful programming”. Playful programming is writing something for the sake of writing it. It’s making a software 3D renderer or a GIF reader, even though better implementations of those already exist. It’s making generative art programs and drawing them with a pen plotter. Cassette itself is playful programming—there are certainly other scripting languages that may be better for personal projects like these, but this one is mine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Continuing,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In particular, I wanted Cassette to feel “essential”, where each aspect of the language reflects some fundamental aspect of computing</em> 
 (from a functional language perspective, at least). For example, I consider garbage collection, lexical scopes, and immutable types essential. The result is a little boring, but I hope it’s a good platform to play with other programming concepts.</p>

<p>The perhaps most melodramatic thing I've ever written about software. Sat in my to publish folder for a while. But I realized I am just a bit melodramatic, no one will care :)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Theory creation, world-building, and crafting software are all one in the same activity. Removing any of these elements eliminates the very value you hired software engineers to provide. But it does more than that. It forces these software engineers to make a difficult choice: fight to create the world they believe in, or give up and live in a world they are no longer invested in.</p>

<p>In the spirit of clearly communicating what you're signing up for, this podcast episode is nearly three hours long, and among other things it contains a discussion of a paper by author Mary Shaw titled <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3480947">Myths &amp; Mythconceptions</a> which takes as an organizing principle a collection of myths that are widely believed by programmers, largely unacknowledged, which shape our views on the nature of programming  <em>as an activity</em>  and the needs of programmers  <em>as people</em>  and the sort of work that we do  <em>as a sort of work</em> , and where by acknowledging these myths the three of us (Mary Shaw primarily, and by extension Jimmy and I, those three people, that's it, no other people appear on this podcast) are able to more vividly grip the image of programming with our mind's eye (or <a href="https://aphantasia.com">somesuch</a>) and conceive of a different formulation for programming, and in addition to these myths this paper also incudes a number of excellent lists that I take great pleasure in reading, beyond which I should also note that the paper does a job of explaining itself and that hopefully you'll find I've done a similar job, that's the spirit, please enjoy.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/YtDvPAfJ8jE">this video</a> I show an implementation of the quicksort algorithm using my visual programming system and not only that, but also the different steps of the output of the algorithm are visualized using a node tree. </p>
<p>One thing I noticed when making these kinds of algorithm flows, that they tend to grow horizontally quickly. So, to help prevent that, I've introduced the concept of "decorators" (they are in the "stacked" nodes). Decorators can be added before or after node-types that support this. </p>
<p>Now at least flows can also grow vertically a bit more. In the future I also want to be able to combine multiple nodes in a component or grouped node. </p>
<p>There are currently only 2 decorator types: expressions and sending data to the node-tree. Editing is not yet possible via the editor itself but only directly in the underlying json data of a flow. Also I needed to improve the way scoped variables work with regard to recursive functions, the same for the "merge"-node-type. Each node receives a scopeId depending on the scope within it is executed (every call to a function creates a new scope, this scopeId is passed to the function-node which passes it through to its connected nodes and so on).</p>

<p>Thought about a new architecture for my tool that would make it play better with LLMs, so as to get more help with generating code. Built an MVP version of it over the last week, or so, with just text-based code, and it works well enough that I'm going to have to re-implement my visual language in the new architecture.</p>

<p>Hey everyone! 👋 I’m a student who’s been working on a side project to explore how LLMs may augment creative problem solving.</p>
<p>I’ve synthesised everything into a rough concept I would love to hear your perspectives on:</p>
<p>~<em><em>Here is a quick demo:</em></em>~  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDRg5WgSrm0"> A tool to augment creative problem-solving. </a></p>
<p>Initial inspirations include Jef Raskin’s “Archy”, Mozilla’s old “Ubiquity” project, the thinking of Vannevar Bush, and recent tools like “mymind”. There are still many ideas and user experience concerns to be properly fleshed out, but hopefully it’s an interesting direction.</p>

<p>I built a little voice recorder in Lua Carousel last night</p>
<p>One little detail here involves Android permissions. I almost ended up asking for microphone permissions in Lua Carousel. Luckily I managed to stop and ask myself what the user experience is. "Hi, I'm Lua Carousel, could I please have access to your mic?" Ick! It seems like a bad idea to ask for a permission for the whole app just in case some single script uses it. Probably affects the conversions from this particular blog post, but I don't want to feel like I'm contributing to the general fatigue over apps asking for permissions. 🤷</p>

<p>aside: The whole issue of passwords and permissions is a  <em>huge</em>  UX issue that deserves a long discussion on of-end-user-programming.  Users should be allowed to  <em>just use</em>  a device without being forced to answer a bunch of questions about technical issues and needing to keep a bowl full of anti-anxiety meds nearby.  Imagine if my refrigerator required me to perform some ritual before allowing me to put my recently-bought lettuce into the crisper.</p>

<p>I've been enjoying the "<a href="https://www.tadiweb.com">tadi web</a>" approach Lu has been espousing lately. I also had some nice discussions at Strange Loop with Devine and a few others about minimizing friction / dependencies / build steps, both broadly but also specifically pertaining to publishing one's personal site. So in this spirit, I've been reworking my personal site a bit. I plan to finally add RSS and, even though it goes against the spirit of Lu and Devine's approaches, add a more complex build process that enables some functionality I've long wanted.</p>

<p>I was exploring a domain outside programming today and thought "gee, I wonder if somebody has written a detailed end-to-end case study about this?' Then, I wondered, "gee, has anybody written a detailed end-to-end case study about a software project?"</p>
<p>I always think of software as a very open and sharing community, where we talk about our work and learn from each other without too much secrecy. But I struggled to think of examples. Of course, we seem to be constantly publishing tiny, focused case studies as blog posts. And this is incredible and valuable. But my curiosity is now piqued about this other thing.</p>

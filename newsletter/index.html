<p>We’re experimenting with different ways of summarising information visually.</p>
<p>This a simple one where we get ‘named entities’, group and lay them out as a tree.</p>
<p>(other categories can be added of course based on anything that an LLM can produce)</p>
<p>To me at least there are couple of interesting things in this space:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>interactions</em> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pagination (done!), sorting, filtering, (re-) moving of the nodes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bidirectional connection to the source (e.g. navigating to a particular mention in the parent block,) and canvas (drag and drop of the nodes to expand on canvas)—cf. the video</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>multiple sources + analysis &amp; comparison</em> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>e.g. a graph that answers the question of what are some common themes, ideas, entities in two pieces of information (e.g. a video lecture and a webpage)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>tools for extending the graph</em> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by search</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by generative AI</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by custom/manual annotations</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I would of course be very grateful for comments on any of the above 🙏</p>

<p>CodeParadise is a (Pharo) Smalltalk project to create web applications using Smalltalk only (and HTML/CSS 😉).</p>
<p>A tiny Smalltalk image runs inside the browser and performs all the UI logic. Normally applications created with CodeParadise have a highly interactive character and communicate with a server environment.</p>
<p>A new feature allows a running tiny image to be saved and restarted later as a Single Page Application. A sealed snapshot is made, meaning the connection with the server environment is removed. All code running inside the browser (in the tiny image) is saved in the snapshot as well as the current DOM. After the snapshot is restarted the application will create the same DOM structure and rehydrate the WebComponents and you'll have a running application again!</p>
<p>For a short video see: <a href="https://youtu.be/9YUXYuo_HaM">youtu.be/9YUXYuo_HaM</a></p>
<p>Or go to the resulting SPA at: <a href="https://codeparadise.nl/blog-example">codeparadise.nl/blog-example</a> (open the browser inspector to see all the WebComponents)</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>

<p>Latest update from my project.  This has finally got me to the point where I can consider deployment as just passing continuations from a build script to a server. The same is true for a client just being a continuation from the server. I think I need a better name for what I'm doing. In this is the video I try and explain it.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am working on a visual programming system to allow for combining multiple visual programming paradigms and not just flow-based-progamming. Finally I've made enough progress to my project to make a small video of it again: <a href="https://youtu.be/mIfs9Axqeic">🎥</a>. </p>
<p>In the video you see a very simple statechart for a traffic light including the visualisation and other needed logic (it also has timers, gates, splitters, a html-node with support for expression-script and a bit more). The traffic light also shows a countdown when the light is red and will countdown to 0 and show a green light again.. all still very simple offcourse.</p>
<p>In the video you can see that the running of the flow is also being shown by those animated elements which move through the flow... since I want to prevent "spaghetti", I've created some node-types that allow for triggering other nodes without having a physical connection. Currently it's not clearly visible (except by text) which nodes are invisibly connected to what node, but I have some ideas on how to improve that. But that's for another video.</p>
<p>The upcoming months I want to focus on improving the UI, interaction and fix bugs to be able to put this online somewhere so it can be tried out and I hopefully can collect some feedback.  </p>
<p>Greetings, Maikel</p>

<p>hey all! i was at a future of coding meetup maybe 6 months ago (at Newspeak in London UK), and someone gave an amazing presentation showing what I think was a  <em>collab drawing tool that continuously scrolling</em> , which I think used some sort of service to handle  <em>websockets</em>  between a lot of ppl. Anyone recall this and have any hints on  <em>what this tool, services or person was called</em> ??? THANK YOU</p>

<p>Some personal news: I just released my first new song in 9 years. You can <a href="https://spiralganglion.bandcamp.com/track/dont-do-math">listen to it here.</a></p>
<p>Can I find a way to make this even vaguely relevant to you, members of the FoC community, other than merely the personal connection we share? Why yes! It's a song about meaning and interpretation, things that I love thinking about when programming and detest thinking about when creative writing. I had to pick some subject, thus: what's something wryly confrontational I can say to all my programmer friends? Don't do math! Stop it. Don't think about it. Don't look for meaning. Stop formalizing, stop proving. Stop saying "easy to reason about".</p>
<p>For those who enjoy this sort of thing, the song is also loaded with music-math "jokes" — collect them all! Microtones, time signature changes, polyrhythm, polymeter, isometer, hocketing, … I even count-in at the beginning (and yes, the first bar comes in waaay early).</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

<p>Hi! I recently noticed how I struggle regrouping things by topic/task/project on my different devices (laptop, phone). Quite frequently, one topic can be spread across 5+ apps/website. My less than ideal solution is to introduce another aggregator app (roam research in my case) and paste &amp; tags different links when possible. Arc browser spaces also helps with that. The issue is that it's very manual and not worth for small ad hoc topic and researches.</p>
<p>Is this a problem you are facing? How do you solve/work-around it? Any interesting links on the topic?</p>
<p>I believe it could &amp; should be solved at the OS level and found really interesting project: <a href="https://playb.it/">playb.it</a>, MercuryOS, <a href="https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/000/">alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/000</a> but I feel like there should be more</p>

<p>Question for people who've read  <em>Tools for Conviviality</em> </p>
<p>Do you think "convivial" in the Illich sense has connotations of communality? Like, having a strong sense of membership in a coherent, shared community?</p>
<p>I'd never really thought of it that way, but I was just chatting with a friend who's only skimmed the essay, and had that impression. Obviously I think I'm right, but I also wonder if I've been reading my own bias towards independence and self-sufficiency into the essay. I'd appreciate thoughts. "The future is a disagreement with the past about what is important." And at this point it doesn't matter what Illich intended, only what we in the audience tend to make of his words.</p>
<p>If we tend to agree that conviviality is independent of social arrangements, and that it is equally applicable to gregarious people who like to be cheek by jowl with others and introverts who are more off on their own, this might suggest that the word "conviviality" isn't an ideal term in the year 2023 for a value a lot of us tend to aim towards here. It was a frontrunner in our long thread about renaming FoC (<a href="https://linen.futureofcoding.org/t/42821/here-s-a-big-one-apologies-in-advance-to-everyone-for-the-un">linen.futureofcoding.org/t/42821/here-s-a-big-one-apologies-in-advance-to-everyone-for-the-un</a>) but perhaps it has some distracting connotations.</p>

<p>Hello FoC Community 🙂</p>
<p>I have something in mind which I don't know exactly how difficult it i or even possible so I'm going to ask for your council here. I have some files 2-4 GB and I want to share those with a friend. What would be the best way to do so? Assuming that I don't want to use dropbox or google drive.  I vaguely remember that there was a programm called wormwhole or somethign which did this using python. I would kike to have something in go which has nice cross OS binaries. This looks nice but I would want to have a simple exchange application wher eI can use it instead of a lib to be implemented. <a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-data-transfer/blob/master/benchmarks/testnet/peernet.go">github.com/filecoin-project/go-data-transfer/blob/master/benchmarks/testnet/peernet.go</a> Another question - fundamental in nature- if I join a P2P net what do I need to exchange with my peer  - out of band such that we can exchange files through the P2P network. ie.e. how do we find each other? Thank you for your thoughts and ideas.</p>

<p>Branching out from the discussions about the current state of AI agents vs. how they were imagined in the text from the recent podcast episode...</p>
<p>I was glad to hear our hosts were on a similar thought-track when discussing the "send this draft to the rest of the group and let me know when they've read it" example regarding how programmers tend to parse the last bit as "let me know when the metrics indicate they scrolled to the end" (etc) whereas a human agent would parse it as "and follow up with them after a reasonable time to ask if they've read it or not."</p>
<p>One thing that struck me was the number of times I've told a white lie in that kind of scenario. Yes, I read it! (No, I haven't, but I just pulled it up when you asked and I'm skimming it now before the meeting starts).</p>
<p>Dishonesty with the metrics-mindset takes a different form. In simple forms, it's like terms of service pages which gate the "agree" button behind a scroll value... You scroll to the end to lie. But if the designers of those metrics were somehow able to perfect them (eye tracking? a quiz at the end?) then an AI agent could force a more accurate/truthful answer from you.</p>
<p>All that to get to my point... Do we have a right to lie about this stuff? How important is it for us to be able to present less-than-truthful representations to other people even if the medium is via an AI agent? If we don't include this concern in our designs, are we facilitating a world of micro-surveillance of coworkers and friends?</p>

<p>The C programming language was devised in the early 1970s as a system implementation language for the nascent Unix operating system. Derived from the typeless language BCPL, it evolved a type structure; created on a tiny machine as a tool to improve a meager programming environment, it has become one of the dominant languages of today. This paper studies its evolution.</p>

<p>(The easiest way to come up with versions also ends up communicating heredity. But that's an unimportant side effect.)</p>

<p>I’ve been digging into how we might interact with AI, beyond chatbots, and whether we could have NPCs as colleagues...</p>
<p>In particular I’ve been writing actual code (ulp) around actual multiplayer apps (ulp) to see what the interactions and issues might be</p>
<p>It is slightly ridiculous to imagine AI NPCs as dolphins... but why not, right? We’ve got a lot of language around “companion species” as a metaphor for AI, so let’s jump and see if that works.</p>
<p>So here’s a Twitter/X thread of my first sketches: multiplayer cursors that look like other users, but are actually NPCs</p>
<p>Big lessons: escaping the chatbot format might let us answer the AI affordance issue (ie how do we know what the AI can do). Here the NPC can proactively tell you. But also apps will need significant re-engineering to present a machine API and NPC runtime</p>
<p>Gonna dig in this direction for a couple weeks, so up for chatting with anyone about the intersection of AI/multiplayer/collaboration/etc</p>

<p>For some time I've thought that type systems are essentially ad-hoc logic languages. So.. why not use a full on logic language (prolog or something) to statically analyze your codebase instead of keep patching onto a type system, it appears to me that logic languages are simpler &amp; more expressive than most type systems. I'm starting to work on this for my language, and creating a logic language in efforts to also understand logic programming better.</p>
<p>Another advantage I can think of is that if a the logic language is expressive enough to type even the most advanced languages as well as the weakest, it could be used as a shared interface between languages to understand at least parts of each others type systems, as well as be a tool for user extension for additional static analysis specific to their project.</p>

<p>I might be missing context here but the fact that type systems are logic languages should be uncontroversial given that that's what the Curry Howard Correspondence is about. Though I'm not very well read I think that using "complete" generic logic languages/solver (as a component) in solving type equations ought to be well trodden ground, my first thought went to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk">github.com/rust-lang/chalk</a> as one example. I'd be looking at what one might give up doing so as the reason why it doesn't happen more: speed? guaranteed termination? good error messages?</p>

<p>This community is a big tent. We welcome folks from all backgrounds, and all levels of experience with computers. Heck, on our last episode, we celebrated an article written by someone who is, rounding down, a lawyer! A constant question I ponder is: what's the best way to introduce someone to the world of FoC? If someone is a workaday programmer, or a non-programmer, what can we share with them to help them understand our area of interest?</p>

They might ask, "Why should typical computer users bother learning to program?" Well, that's the wrong question! Instead, we should start broader. Why do we use computers? What do we use them to do? What happens when they don't do what we want? Who controls what they do? Will this ever change? What change do we want? Nardi challenges us to explore these questions, and gives the reader a gentle but definitive push in a positive direction.</p>

<p>I think I figured out how I want to visualize a logic program executing in a debugger. A tree of trees. Chess-style variation tree navigator, where each node represents a search step and shows the search tree and bindings at that time, plus where the new unification clause was found in the source code. Anyone ever seen a logic debugger like that?</p>

<h2>Thinking Together</h2>
<p>💭 The reality of abstractions by <strong>Daniel Buckmaster</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://history.futureofcoding.org/history/weekly/2023/08/W4/thinking-together.html#2023-08-25T00:57:27.641Z">🧵 conversation</a></p>
<p>In Episode 66 there was a long discussion about an idea I've come to know as  <em>the reality of abstractions</em> . I got that phrasing from David Deutsch in The Beginning Of Infinity.</p>
<p>I've long wanted to write about this in connection to programming, where we talk a lot about "abstractions", but in a very different sense* to the way Deutsch does. In lieu of doing that (which sounds like a lot of work) I will just post some of my favourite Deutsch quotes about it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reductionism and holism are both mistakes. In reality, explanations do not form a hierarchy with the lowest level being the most fundamental. Rather, explanations at any level of emergence can be fundamental. Abstract entities are real, and can play a role in causing physical phenomena. Causation is itself such an abstraction.</p>
<p>When we use theories about emergent physical quantities to explain the behaviour of water in a kettle, we are using an abstraction - an ‘idealized’ model of the kettle that ignores most of its details - as an approximation to a real physical system. But when we use a computer to investigate prime numbers, we are doing the reverse: we are using the physical computer as an approximation to an abstract one which perfectly models prime numbers. Unlike any real computer, the latter never goes wrong, requires no maintenance, and has unlimited memory and unlimited time to run its program.</p>
<p>Abstractions are essential to a fuller explanation. You know that if your computer beats you at chess, it is really the program that has beaten you, not the silicon atoms or the computer as such. 
 <em>[Nor, I would add, the arrangements of pixels on the screen which symbolize knights, pawns, etc.]</em> 
 The abstract program is instantiated physically as a high-level behaviour of vast numbers of atoms, but the explanation of why it has beaten you cannot be expressed without also referring to the program in its own right. That program has also been instantiated, unchanged, in a long chain of different physical substrates, including neurons in the brains of the programmers and radio waves when you downloaded the program via wireless networking, and finally as states of long- and short-term memory banks in your computer. The specifics of that chain of instantiations may be relevant to explaining how the program reached you, but it is irrelevant to why it beat you: there, the content of the knowledge (in it, and in you) is the whole story. That story is an explanation that refers ineluctably to abstractions; and therefore those abstractions exist, and really do affect physical objects in the way required by the explanation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To connect this to the content of the episode - I think all the different representations of a cube on a screen are "real". The parts that you might dismiss as not having an "effect on the world", like the data structures in RAM, or the textual representation stored on disk, are as unavoidably real at their own levels of abstraction.</p>
<p>*Colloquially, I think working programmers use "abstraction" to mean things ranging from "I can ignore the details 'below' this point" to "I can <a href="https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0015">compress</a> this implementation into fewer syntax tokens". A <a href="https://www.pathsensitive.com/2022/03/abstraction-not-what-you-think-it-is.html">contrary view</a> from Dijkstra, which I think is closer to Deutsch's view, is abstraction as "a new semantic layer in which one can be absolutely precise".</p>

<p>later, continuing…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The same is often true of complexity. The real test is the question “what are you willing to sacrifice to achieve simplicity?” If the answer is “nothing”, then you don’t actually love simplicity at all, it’s your lowest priority.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I say “sacrifice”, I don’t mean that choosing simplicity will mean you are worse off overall – simplicity brings massive benefits. But it does mean that there will be some things that tempt you to believe you are missing out.</p>
<p>Looking beyond the inflammatory fun title, how do ya’ll think this relates to the future of coding? Is a reason that visual programming is often just around the corner because folks aren’t willing to shed some of the complexity (read also as “power” or “flexibility”) of existing programming systems?</p>

<p>A nice essay on programming languages, but with a message that is much more general: <a href="https://journal.infinitenegativeutility.com/leaving-haskell-behind">journal.infinitenegativeutility.com/leaving-haskell-behind</a></p>
<p>It's about the tension between "make better technology", "use start-of-the-art technology", and "use boring (but stable and well understood) technology". Different goals, different tools.</p>
<p>Another example I have experienced a lot: mathematics and physics. Mathematicians work on new mathematics, mathematical physicists introduce state-of-the-art mathematics into physics, and all other physicists use 100-year-old mathematics from textbooks. And each group complains about the attitude of the two others.</p>

<p>A little bit of Rules as Code in Unit: "a person can write a will if they are 18 or at least 14 and in the military". The checkbox indicates if they are military, the number field is their age, and the text field is the answer to whether they can write a will. What's interesting is that the diagram illustrates the reasons. If they qualify both ways, both paths are yellow.</p>

<p>Critical code studies is the application of the hermeneutics of the humanities to the interpretation of the extra-functional significance of computer source code. “Extra” here does not mean “outside of” or “apart from” but instead it refers to a significance that is “growing out of” an understanding of the functioning of the code.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Still, reading code, even <em>without</em> interpreting its cultural significance, can be no easy task. Ask a professional programmer who inherits legacy code to maintain or, worse yet, to improve, and they will tell you about the dread of sorting out just-in-time code, minimally documented, written with hasty patches, full of compromises and workarounds. Even those who write their code in artistic projects can be shy about sharing their code out of embarrassment and self-consciousness. This shame is a product of the “encoded chauvinism” of programming culture, one that can be fostered on the internet as much as it is in classrooms

<p>Let me speak generally for a moment. I've concluded that there are two basic metaphors for pre-computer writing. One is the long-hand manuscript page. The other is the typewritten page. Most word processors have decided to emulate the second — and, at first glance, that would seem to be the logical one to adopt. But, as a creative writer, I am convinced that the long-hand page is the better metaphor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider: On a long-hand page, you can jump back and forth in your document with ease. You can put in bookmarks, either actual paper ones, or just fingers slipped into the middle of the manuscript stack. You can annotate the manuscript for yourself with comments like "Fix this!" or "Don't forget to check these facts" without there being any possibility of you missing them when you next work on the document. And you can mark a block, either by circling it with your pen, or by physically cutting it out, without necessarily having to do anything with it right away. The entire document is your workspace.</p>
<p>On a typewritten page, on the other hand, you are forced to deal with the next sequential character. Your thoughts are focussed serially on the typing of the document. If you're in the middle of a line halfway down page 7, your only easy option is to continue on that line. To go backwards to check something is difficult, to put in a comment that won't show when your document is read by somebody else is impossible, and so on. Typing is a top-down, linear process, not at all conducive to the intuitive, leaping-here-and-there kind of thought human beings are good at.</p>

<p>👋 howdy folks! We just shipped an integration for Linear &amp; Github issues in Magnet (<a href="http://www.magnet.run">www.magnet.run</a>) our AI coding assistant that is powered by GPT-4.</p>
<p>This gives you a way to quickly take an issue, and go end-to-end on getting suggestion for relevant files, having Magnet ask clarifying questions, and having it make suggestions on how to implement the feature across your entire stack, e.g. front-end, backend, and database.</p>
<p>Lots of fun explorations as we’ve built this, and we’re going to be diving deeper into some of the research questions that have come up in terms of how to give AI appropriate context on the task at hand</p>

<p>State machines are  <em>hard</em> !</p>

<li>We usually have one in our head when we program.</li>
<li>The abstract state in my head is usually made up of multiple concrete variables in the program.</li>
<li>Mutations happen to variables, but it's not obvious at each how the abstract state is changing.</li>

<p><em>Grokking</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2021, researchers made a striking discovery while training a series of tiny models on toy tasks . They found a set of models that suddenly flipped from memorizing their training data to correctly generalizing on unseen inputs after training for much longer. This phenomenon – where generalization seems to happen abruptly and long after fitting the training data – is called
 <em>grokking</em>
 and has sparked a flurry of interest .</p>

<p>You know that thing when playing Pokemon games where after you throw a Pokeball you frantically tap the action button to ... do something? It is never made clear if this helps or even does anything at all.</p>
<p>What are other ghost-mechanics like this in games or software that you know of, where folks often take actions that aren’t clearly signposted to actually do anything?</p>
<p>The most immediate other example that comes to mind is swiping apps away in the iOS app switcher, but that isn’t exactly the same thing, since, even if it doesn’t free up memory, it is a direct interaction that alters state (removes options from the app switcher).</p>

<p><em>Retrofitting of Medium</em> </p>
<p>I tend to think every time a new medium is introduced, all the contents of the previous medium are ported over,  <em>without regard for fully understanding the new medium</em> . For instance, films matured when it stopped porting over books, games matured when it stopped porting over movies, etc. An excellent example of this is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/">Outer Wilds</a>, a space-exploration time-traveling game which is simply impossible to recreate in any other medium. It fulfills the medium.</p>
<p>Given that, I think two new forms of medium are being introduced in the next 5 years: <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-paradigm/#:~:text=Summary%3A%20AI%20is%20introducing%20the,reversing%20the%20locus%20of%20control.">LLMs</a> and VR. If we accept the supposition that there will be a lot of retrofitting of the medium, i.e. chat into LLMs, games into VR,  <em>what are the content that will truly fulfill the mediums of LLMs and VR?</em> </p>

<p>Is there a reasonably decent JavaScript library that allows me to have a reasonably terminal-y experience in the browser, so I can implement a shell? Ideally with history, autocomplete, colors, etc. - and then with the ability to add DOM nodes too, so I can click, show images, etc. Preferably no backend necessary.</p>

<p>Some consider live streaming—the broadcasting of video and/or audio footage live online—simply an internet fad or source of entertainment, yet it is at the center of the digital mediation of our lives. In this edited volume, Johanna Brewer, Bo Ruberg, Amanda L. L. Cullen, and Christopher J. Persaud present a broad range of essays that explore the cultural implications of live streaming, paying special attention to how it is shifting notions of identity and power in digital spaces. The diverse set of international authors included represent a variety of perspectives, from digital media studies to queer studies, from human-computer interaction to anthropology, and more.</p>

<p>(Hopefully this question isn’t too far outside of “coding” and into “using”.) I’ve always had an interest in associative data management, but I’ve never found a tool I love for my use case. What I want to be able to do is catalog and visually explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideas in some area of research</li>
<li>Sources for those ideas: who has presented them</li>
<li>Chains of reasoning: person A argues that because of ideas X and Y, therefore Z is true</li>
<li>Commentary on those ideas: supporting, refuting, adapting</li>
</ul>
<p>General mind-mapping tools don’t feel structured enough, but coding it from scratch has been intimidating. It feels like this must exist and I must just be bad at finding it. Do any of you have a tool you like for this use?</p>

<p>I’ve been re-building Subset.so to make it way easier to reuse templates directly in the editor. The idea is that you should be able to build beautiful spreadsheets without starting from scratch. For example if you want to build dashboard with a P&amp;L and inputs, you can find both templates and drop them into the same editor.

<p>So more expressive than something like sinatra, but running at cool 140K requests/s.</p>
<p>The dichotomy between expressiveness/comfort and performance is a false one, a bit like the one we used to have between user-friendly but crashy client-operating systems and solid but unfriendly server operating systems.  Now my phone and my watch both run Unix.</p>

<p>Hi all, for those of us who have an interest in learning about how to build a more wonderful future and who wish to be inspired by those rare few actually building something different, I recommend that you visit and enjoy the Norman Foster exhibit at the Centre Pompidou which ends on the 7th of August.</p>
<p>Those who are unfamiliar may not see the relevance of a building architect's work to programmers and software / hardware designers, but I assure you that his long history of work is exceptionally relevant.</p>
<p>His designs are a deeply-considered human-scale 'high-tech' alternative to traditionalist buildings and to postmodern buildings. With tonnes of innovative features which had never been implemented before and which seemed obvious and common-sense after the fact.</p>
<p>This work sounds a lot like what we are working on in the software, hardware and otherwise industrial realms.</p>
<p>If you are in Paris or are able to get to Paris, entry is 17 euros.</p>
<p>I'll be going on the 7th of August if anyone is around for drinks, lunch and/or a chat 🙂</p>

<p>I've found this article on using CozoDB (A relational/graph database) as the hypocampus for AI.

<p>Hi, I am experimenting with functionality to be able to inspect "path executions" in a visual flow (the flow in the video is adding random values to an array of which the total sum is calculated): in the short video you can see me inspecting the last executed path with the slider on the bottom.. with this you can inspect the different stages of an executed path. After a flow has been run, the last path can be inspected.</p>
<p>With the slider on the right you can switch between paths which have been executed before.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the video I've pressed the 'run' button multiple times, all these executions can be inspected with this slider.. and the current execution path that is being inspected can be inspected further with the slider on the bottom.</p>

<p>Hey folks, I’ve just launched the beta of the side project app I shared a video about a few months ago. I’ve settled on the name Riverbed. It allows you to create mini-apps to track your personal information on cards, including columns that automatically filter your cards and buttons that allow you to configure simple actions on them. It’s maybe an “almost-no-code” system? You can choose actions from a list instead of typing in scripts.</p>
<p>Some of the things I’m exploring include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many types of app this card-and-column UX is helpful for,</li>
<li>How much we can accomplish in this domain in an “almost-no-code” approach, where instead of a scripting language we have a set of actions to choose from a dropdown, to make it more accessible to non-programmers, and</li>
<li>To what degree a focus on matching the UX of non-user-configurable apps is achievable or the best use of effort</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s free to use and OSS. More info and video here, including ideas for how I might develop it in the future; I would love any input folks in this community would like to provide! <a href="https://about.riverbed.app/">about.riverbed.app</a></p>

<p>(I shared a very early version of Magnet when it was just a Mac Desktop app - but now it fully runs on the web)</p>
<p>We just shipped a web version of 🧲 Magnet <a href="https://magnet.run">magnet.run</a> - an AI coding assistant.</p>
<p>The sign ups are growing pretty quickly and there’s a lot of love from the early users. We think you’ll like it too. It’s free to use if you put in your own OpenAI API key, and over time we’ll charge for more advanced features like integrations and access to the latest unreleased models.</p>
<p>If you’re using ChatGPT to help with coding tasks, and finding yourself copying and pasting, Magnet is similar, but built specifically for working with code. You can open local code repos, connect GitHub issues, and pick files and issues as context of for the task at hand.</p>

<p>The default behaviour for a validated text field in Blockly is to turn the background red while the value is invalid, and if the user hits enter (or nvaigates away from the field) while the field is red, abandon the change and return the field to the previous value. This feels broken to me. In the visual interface, if you try to put something somewhere and it doesn't "fit", the piece doesn't go back where it started. It stays close to where you tried to put it, but far enough away to visually indicate that it isn't connected. So you get immediate feedback that it didn't work, and what was done instead. But in the text field, if I have "value" and I change it to "value$", and the dollar sign is invalid, the field will only turn red between when I hit dollarsign and when I hit enter, and then it will go back to the previous value, and just hope I notice that it didn't do what I wanted it to do. For people who look at the keys while typing, that's not going to work. Blockly steadfastly tries to avoid invalid state, presumably because syntax errors aren't any fun. But in the visual interface it accomplishes that by making invalid syntax impossible to generate, and when it modifies the syntax for you to keep it valid, that's easy to see. Here, it lets you type an invalid value, let's you hit enter, and the fact it didn't work is potentially invisible. It feels like it should be possible to do better. Has anyone seen an interface for entering values into a text field that solves this problem? Where the field maintains a valid value, starting with a default, but it also allows you to maintain a view on failed attempts to modify it, so that you can correct them? Should the screen just go modal, not responding to "enter" or clicks outside the editor while the value is invalid? Should the failed attempt to change it be noted somewhere? Or is maintaining valid state in text fields a silly goal, and instead you should just throw errors at a later step, or something?</p>

<p>I've been working on the plugin system more for my editor. Each of these panes are a completely separate web assembly modules. The tokens and token kinds are provided by another separate module that communicates with rust analyzer. Still very early days, but exciting that I was able to whip up a simple little UI for helping me map colors to tokens rather than needing to do it manually.</p>

<p>I've had this idea rattling in my head to make a frontend framework that's  <em>only</em>  signals, and after almost a year of maturation I finally put down some code today. Genuinely surprised this works.</p>
<p>I'm curious where it starts to break down. It's not like modern frameworks are unaware of signals, most feature them heavily, so there's probably some reason they haven't gone all-in on them too, right?</p>
<p>I'm using tldraw's lovely  <code>signia</code>  for signals implementation, hence the first param of atoms being a 'name' and not meaningful for execution. This also gave me an excuse to read  <code>signia</code> 's source and discover their clever trick for tracking atom inheritance which is pretty neat.</p>

<p>I've started to work on a structural editor for my language coil <a href="https://coil-editor.netlify.app/">coil-editor.netlify.app</a></p>
<p>It's still early &amp; buggy, but the idea is to directly turn the AST into html with contenteditable for leaf attribute nodes.</p>

<p>which is the coil AST:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">{type: :property_lookup, lhs: {type: :id_lookup, name: "document"}, property: "body"}
</pre></div>

<p>Turns into:</p>

<p>And now we can easily query this expression with css selectors. So all the syntax highlighting AND formatting is done in css. It also means that static analysis can be done using querySelector.</p>

<p>Hey Guys I've been working on a way to code in VR in an effective way. The code is open source and is available here: <a href="https://github.com/felipereigosa/kairon">github.com/felipereigosa/kairon</a>, for the full video where I show how it works and build a few things with it, let me know if you like it.</p>

<p><em>I've been thinking a lot about apprenticeships over the last year and specifically the lack of apprenticeships in tech.</em> </p>
<p>My mental model of apprenticeships is primary formed around how they apply to the arts -- people learning a craft from a single practitioner who has worked their life to develop a personal style or system. But apprenticeships also exist in trade, maybe even more so. Fundamentally, apprenticeships facilitate knowledge transfer -- all industries can benefit from that, no? So, I wonder why apprenticeships are far less common in software?</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it because so many industry vets were themselves self taught and so that mindset has lingered?</li>
<li>Is it that so much of our industry is focused on access, democratization, and open sharing of information?</li>
<li>Could it be that we need to train more software engineers than we have hours in the day, and that need for more qualified minds has pushed us beyond the 1-on-1 learning paradigm and towards bootcamps etc?</li>
<li>Maybe so much of software and the knowledge around it is already accessible, so apprenticeships are just overkill? That said, there are still pockets of software where subject matter expertise and knowledge silos outweigh what is either 1) commonly taught in schools or 2) generally available.</li>
<li>Software doesn't have the same requirements around professional certifications -- could that be at play?</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, do you all think there's value in apprenticeships or should we (continue to) move in the other direction entirely -- teach the masses? In that sense, I could see the argument that apprenticeships border on nepotism and are actually a form of gatekeeping. Have any of you been part of a formal apprenticeship (on either end)? If so, what conditions made that possible?</p>

<p><em>What we talk about when we talk about expressivity</em> </p>
<p>I enjoyed the little tangent on expressivity in the latest episode. I've had thoughts on this recently and it prompted me to skim Felleisen's paper. I really resonated with the hosts' reframing of expressivity as being the part of the language that's oriented towards the programmer, not towards the machine.</p>
<p>I currently think that most programmers, when talking about "expressivity", actually mean essentially two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can use my own words</li>
<li>I am not restricted by grammar</li>
</ul>
<p>These things are strongly tied to writing, as that's still how we do most of our coding.</p>
<p>"Using my own words" is literally that - in any given chunk of source text, how many of the words were chosen by the programmer (e.g. to be particular to their domain or their theory of the program) and how many were specified by the language or environment? Punctuation, I think, also counts as words the programmer didn't get to choose. Random examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Ruby, one can create little DSLs where almost all words in a specific part of the code are "my own words"</li>
<li>In assembly languages, the programmer can choose almost none of the words (except labels?)</li>
<li>Being able to rename imported symbols lets the programmer choose their own words in specific contexts (same goes for type aliases, etc.)</li>
<li>Languages with few keywords should tend to have more words chosen by the programmer... or at least, by the authors of the standard library?</li>
</ul>
<p>I equate being "unrestricted by grammar" roughly to whether a language is statement-oriented or expression-oriented. The Austral spec has a great section on why it chose to be statement-oriented, and concludes that "a statement-oriented syntax is less simple, but it forces code to be structurally simple": <a href="https://austral-lang.org/spec/spec.html#stmt-orientation">austral-lang.org/spec/spec.html#stmt-orientation</a></p>
<p>In Austral, it's an ideological choice to force programs into a certain shape. But in general, it seems to me that languages with less "grammatical restrictions" in their parser are described as more expressive. Maybe this is just correlation with other features of those languages.</p>
<p>I'd love to know how everyone else understands "expressivitiy" when we talk about programming.</p>

<p>I think this topic, based as it is on personal experience, deserves better visibility, so hopefully Rachel won't mind my reposting it here! 🤗</p>

<p>[July 13th, 2023 9:38 PM] rachel: hey both! thanks for replying here.. as per your question Joe, I would consider someone a software engineer if they know how to code - whether they have a CS degree, or did a bootcamp, or learned on their own. Someone who can code and build applications. I have no formal training in coding. However, I am excited about the potential of AI to help me make an app by generating code for me.</p>
<p>To answer your question Duncan - I've mostly been using a combination of asking chatGPT for the steps and code, and also using an app I am working on with a cofounder called Sublayer. We noticed that the chat interface is not really the best interface for building (and changing) complex apps, but we're still exploring the right workflow for it. Definitely eager to learn from this group how others are getting the best code generation out of the existing LLMs.</p>

<p>I've been thinking a lot about the patterns and architectures we're going to see start to emerge that lend themselves well to being written by generative AI and came across this technique being used by a library called Marvin (<a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/marvin">github.com/PrefectHQ/marvin</a>) where they limit the tokens the LLM can respond with to just a single token corresponding to a value in an enum. They then have it respond with the value as the response to a natural language query. This is extra interesting because responding with a single token is relatively fast and cheap.</p>
<p>The example they give is using it in routing:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">    USER_PROFILE = "/user-profile"

    SEARCH = "/search"

    NOTIFICATIONS = "/notifications"

    SETTINGS = "/settings"

    HELP = "/help"

    CHAT = "/chat"

    DOCS = "/docs"

    PROJECTS = "/projects"

    WORKSPACES = "/workspaces"





AppRoute("update my name")

# AppRoute.USER_PROFILE
</pre></div>

<p>But I feel like there's a seed of an idea here that points to what a piece of an LLM-core architecture may look like. I experimented with the idea a bit in chatgpt earlier today (screenshots attached) and I'd love to know if anyone finds this interesting or has any thoughts/opinions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Verse is a new programming language, being designed at Epic Games as the language of the metaverse. Verse is a functional logic language, with a bunch of innovative ideas. Like Haskell, Verse is declarative (a variable in Verse stands for just one, immutable value), and higher order (lambdas are first class). But Verse goes well beyond Haskell, with existential variables, unification, expressions that yield multiple values, and much more besides. In this talk we'll give you a sense of what functional logic programming is about, what it looks like to program in Verse, and how we can give meaning to Verse programs using rewrite rules.</p>

<p>My sister asked whether her middle-school son should pick the choice of a block programming language (like Scratch), JavaScript, or C# for a class he's in.  I claimed that he'll learn the same fundamentals with blocks minus the frustration, tedium, tea ceremony, and incantations associated with the others.  To prove that the block program has the real creativity and that moving to the others is practically automatable, I took <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/605658/">may favorite Scratch program</a> and had Chat translate it into JavaScript and C# <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/02215935-c0b8-4fc9-9bf9-94f0b3fab613">chat.openai.com/share/02215935-c0b8-4fc9-9bf9-94f0b3fab613</a>.  The results seemed promising.  Chat even made helpful observations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Translating the same Scratch program to C# requires a different approach because C# is often used in desktop applications, and there's no direct equivalent of the Canvas API like in web technologies. However, you can use Windows Forms or WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) for graphical applications in C#. Here, I'll provide an example using Windows Forms to create a simple drawing application that mimics the Scratch program's behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you check my conversation, you'll see I start asking what a "partial class" is having never heard the term.  Chat parroted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using partial classes in this way provides flexibility. You can start with all your code in one file for simplicity. Then, if the class grows or you decide to use the designer, you can easily refactor the designer-generated code into its own file without changing the class's functionality. This approach keeps your custom code separate from the auto-generated code, making it easier to read and maintain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I explained that every language, every tool has many such conventions. You learn the ones reverent to whatever you're doing right now, but learning them all is impossible. Instead the real skill is knowing that you don't know and being able to find out quickly. We're lucky that a these things are obscure, come up often, and are discussed on the Web. Thus LLMs are especially good at helping with dumb programming problems.</p>
<p>So why use the established languages besides Chat knowing them well?  I thought of three reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expressivity — Blocks will get a beginner pretty far, but you'll find the others have constructs that helpful for saying things that would be very hard with blocks.  You won't appreciate scratch until you feel the itch.</li>
<li>Causal Powers — The block system will let you do things in class you'll learn core ideas, but the blocks themselves won't work everywhere.  JavaScript, on the other hand, works all over on the web, and C# has its own ecosystem.  Often there's bridging, but also one or other language will be the most natural one for certain kinds of work.</li>
<li>Scale — With big and medium sized programs being done with text, editors for wrangling it, and version control for keeping track of it exist.  They can we weirdly powerful and janky.  But you're liable to start having a hard time keeping track of blocks when it takes a dozen or more screens to fit them all.</li>
</ul>

<p>I recently thought about combining natural language prompts in code notebooks interface because it seemed like a great use case to me. While working with data, a mixture of low-level capability of writing code and a high-level capability to write transformations or visualization instructions in natural language can be a great advantage. You can code when you want to, and completely skip and offload to an LLM by writing natural language instructions! The notebook executes code and prompts in a single context. Here's something you can try that implements this idea: <a href="https://try-slate.com/">try-slate.com</a></p>
<p>Also wrote some thoughts in a <a href="https://mohitkarekar.com/posts/2024/slate/">post here</a> and a short <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/bcde36f3fa424b2f80c860def0b3f164?sid=2bf8cdea-ef9e-4421-9388-570a097e02f9">video demo here</a>.</p>

<p>I listened to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/terminology-take-100835945">a podcast about Hest recently</a> (that I wasn't even on!), and have been thinking about taking another crack at it. I'm in a really different situation now, work/life wise, and am less inhibited by idealistic ambitions (like a bunch of NIH making me write my own 3D engine, or an obsession with conceptual purity forcing me to make everything bootstrapped). Now the biggest blocker is that I only have scraps of free time, and I've been using all of it to make music. Oh, how I miss being 20 and free from obligation!</p>

<p>I've made a new form field control for arrays of objects. The properties that go into the object can be specified and in this example I've used it to implement a simple gradient color node. This example can be viewed at <a href="https://demo.codeflowcanvas.io/gl">demo.codeflowcanvas.io/gl</a> and then select "Moving circle" from the examples drop-down (I just noticed a weird bug on iOS.. so please just try on desktop).</p>

<p>Is there any wisdom on  <em>how to best lay out code in a visual code browser</em> ?</p>
<p>In my experience, code can be layed out either more horizontally on long lines or more vertically on short lines. This is controlled by setting a criterion for how many levels of nesting there can be before a node switches to a multiline layout. Long lines use space efficiently but tend to get hard to read. Short lines are easier to read, as tokens of similar significance line up in columns, but tend to take up much vertical space while leaving most of the horizontal space unused, as the average line is just one key and one value.</p>
<p>Shall I accept that code gets very vertical, and use the free horizontal space to add multilevel navigation panels, or is there a third option that is more horizontal while still easy to read? I can go really fancy and add tables and multiple columns, since I have full control over the layout function, but not all code is regular enough to fit a tabular format, and I cannot require the person editing the code to manually bikeshed it by editing whitespace or dragging around visual nodes. I've seen the <a href="https://gitlab.com/procps-ng/procps/-/blob/master/src/top/top.c">horrors of manually bikeshedded plain-text languages</a> and the horrors of node-based languages where the programmer makes a simple one node change and then has to drag all the nodes around so they line up. Are there any examples of interesting solutions to look at?</p>
<p>Here's how I mean a more horizontal layout:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[redacted]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's how I mean a more vertical layout:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[redacted]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the more horizontal layout, I can barely parse the surprise structure at a glance, and I can barely see if I've made a mistake in editing. It takes a lot less screen space though.</p>

<p>I read both this morning and I know these are different use cases, however they beautifully cover the whole optimism/pessimism spectrum on AI.</p>
<p>Where do people here fall on that spectrum? Are there use cases that are obviously good/bad, or does that depend on… well… what? And are we going to outsource most of our lives soon to AI assistants while simultaneously drowning in mediocre generated bullsh*t trying to scam us?</p>
<p>Gosh, I miss the time of the early internet when I was excited about everything tech. Somehow I can’t find back into that mindset these days. Can someone convince me that the future is going to be universally great, like it used to be 20 years ago?</p>

<p>In the spirit of our <strong>#thinking-together</strong> capitalism thread. I found <a href="https://informal.systems/2020/09/21/informal-owners/">informal.systems/2020/09/21/informal-owners</a> i think this is an interesting example of how to change the bigger structure- capitalism (this time I spelled it out <a href="https://twitter.com/stefanlesser">Stefan Lesser</a> 😅  ) by changing smaller structures I.e. companies to cooperatives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>📝 <a href="https://informal.systems/2020/09/21/informal-owners/">Informal Organizations: Iterating on Cooperative Ownership</a></p>
<p>Our mission at Informal Systems is not just about distributed systems, it&amp;#39;s also about the organizations that grow along with them. Our vision is an open-source ecosystem of cooperatively owned and governed distributed organizations running on reliable distributed systems. To achieve this vision, we begin with ourselves, adopting a democratic structure that aims to rebalance the power dynamics between capital and labour towards something more sustainable and non-extractive; something that nurtures long term employment and real wealth creation through R&amp;D, entrepreneurship, and innovation; something more like a Zebra than a Unicorn.</p>

<p>Yes, the time has finally come! I'll share a link to my visual programming project online! I've been mainly showing some video's on the devlog channel about the project.</p>
<p>Warning upfront: Although I've been working on this for quite some time (I even started from the ground up last year after working on my previous visual programming project for multiple years).. there's still a lot of work to be done and bugs to be fixed. The UI/UX is far from perfect but it is demo-able enough I think. However, it's still just in "demo-stage" and not usable by other projects (I haven't build any npm packages for integrating or vs-code extension for example).</p>
<p>My goal is to make a generic visual programming system (VPS) with which domain or application specific vpl's can be made. For now I am implementing 2 vpl's on top of the current base: a flow-based-programming inspired system and a "visual shader-toy".</p>
<p>Since the tool is an infinite canvas, you can zoom and drag the canvas using mouse/wheel/touchpad. I've spend some time getting touchscreen support, but more work definitely needs to be done there.</p>
<p>When you open up one of the editors, you can use the dropdown in the top-menu to load an example flow.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here's the link: <a href="https://codeflowcanvas.io">codeflowcanvas.io</a> : there are 2 demo playgrounds in which you can play around.</p>
<p>I'll post some more details in the 🧵.</p>

<p>A little thing like an 'edit' button introduces cascading issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>LÖVE (in combination with mobile restrictions) won't let me modify code files in place. I have to overlay my changes in a new location.</li>
<li>But now I can't pick up any upgrades to my app. Upgrades modify code files in place, but any overlay persists (otherwise you'd completely lose your changes after upgrading).</li>
<li>But hey I have a programmable editor here! I'll just create a new file called 'scratch' with a one-liner to blow away the overlay. (With my app user's hat on, I know in this case my changes are minor in a way that I don't with my app developer's hat on.)</li>
<li>(A few hours later.) Wait, now none of my changes are having any effect. And they're completely blown away when I go back to the code.</li>
<li>🤦 Oh it's that 'scratch' file still hanging around. So it needs to be a 2-liner. I have to make any changes I want to the file system -- and then delete 'scratch' to make this a one-time operation.</li>
<li>I could try to create a screen of helpers for this, along with a comment that says, "insert file system operations here" after which is a delete of 'scratch'.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this way I find myself playing meta-Sokoban.. 🙄</p>
<p>Tl;dr - the 'edit' button isn't really usable yet.</p>
<p>I  <em>really</em>  don't want to go down the road of building a compare and merge flow 🙄</p>

<p>Simple shortest-path routing to reduce some of the drudgery in Sokoban. Integrated with undo.</p>
<p>Next up: routing while pushing a single crate without moving any other crates. That feels more complicated than this glorified breadth-first search. In particular, I'm not yet sure how to detect cycles. Moving a crate can involve being in the same place over and over again. I think I need to hash the player's location in combination with the crate's location 🤔</p>

<p>Another concept I've been ideating about is how to bring Literate Programming, by Donald Knuth, into my daily work, which involves modern tools and stacks like VSCode and Node.js. I believe inline, rich text snippets which are integrated with some kind of personal knowledge management system is the way to go. This way, instead of having comments like this:</p>
<p>// TODO: Refactor this to use the revised approach</p>
<p>It instead would look like using Notion or Obsidian inside VSCode. So above a function, would be a small window into a single page that describes a single function. You can do anything here, like linking references that are relevant to the design of the function. Or you could even have a lengthy design document that explains why a function was written a certain way. Going even further, you could have a page which describes the evolution of a function over time, why at the beginning it was written a certain way, why changes had to be made, and why it looks the way it looks right now.</p>
<p>And added bonus of this approach is that now it's possible to have a single source of truth for docs and your code. So rather than maintaining a separate Docusaurus that has to be updated to sync it with evolution in code, you can just maintain documentation in line. And then to publish developer docs online, you merely just take all the little snippets above each function and then aggregate them onto a single page.</p>
<p>Basically, this approach is powerful because instead of 1D strings of text, now you can have the power of rich text in your code. Including diagrams, and even embedding other programs through <iframes> would be possible. And when your code needs to be compiled, all these rich text snippets are simply removed.</iframes></p>

<p>Jakob Nielsen asserts that accessibility has failed to serve disabled users because of a mistaken focus on standards. This approach is unable to address the wide variety of disabilities, and because it is by definition a derivative of a GUI, it is doomed to provide a second-class experience to e.g. blind users. He points out differing needs by older and less literate users, and proposes generative UI as a promising solution.</p>
<p>I was skeptical of the headline and tweet-length summaries. There has been not-insignificant backlash. The full article leaves me still skeptical but certainly willing to see where the idea of bespoke-to-one's-needs UIs could take us.</p>

In the emerging paradigm of choreographic programming (CP), choreographies are programs that can be compiled to executable implementations. 
CP originated primarily in the context of process calculi, with preliminary work done to establish its foundations and experiment with implementations. Recently, several proposals have shown that one can adapt CP to work in synergy with mainstream programming paradigms ...</p>

<p>Dave Ackley’s paper Beyond Efficiency is three pages long. With just these three pages, he mounts a compelling argument against the conventional way we engineer software. Instead of inflexibly insisting upon correctness, maybe allow a lil slop? Instead of chasing peak performance with cache and clever tricks, maybe measure many times before you cut. So in this episode, we’re putting every CEO in the guillotine… (oh, that stands for “correctness and efficiency only”, don’t put us on a list)… and considering when, where, and how to do the robust thing.</p>

<p>I want to create a computing ecosystem that solves most of the problems in what I call 'unregulated I/O'.</p>
<p>It is quite possibly mad. Or it might work, and I will be surprised.</p>

<p>If you’ve wondered:</p>
<ul>
<li>why the only copilot we have is for VSCode</li>
<li>why not every app is end-user programmable</li>
</ul>
<p>I wondered the same thing, and I’ve built (<a href="https://omnipilot.ai">omnipilot.ai</a>), an AI copilot that works everywhere on macOS.</p>
<p>Specifically it lets you invoke GPT to type into any app ( <em>particularly interesting to me is it works great in Xcode</em> ), can also autocomplete text in any app, and lets you chat with GPT-4 with context from your recent apps. I’d really appreciate any feedback or first impressions!</p>
<p>Re end-user programmability I’m also working on making it more possible for people to make little “automations” on their computer, whether it’s adding buttons to Finder to convert files or recording little AI-enhanced macros.</p>
<p>Some specific questions I’d love feedback:</p>
<ul>
<li>How often do you find yourself wanting help editing code outside of a Github Copilot-enabled environment? What are those situations or apps?</li>
<li>What about text, do you wish you had a copilot for text too?</li>
<li>What do you think of the “works everywhere” approach vs. a dedicated app?</li>
<li>Do the AI-macros sound appealing or meh?</li>
<li>Any thoughts on the landing page copy/design?</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m also happy to answer any other questions. Thanks in advance for sharing your thoughts, it’s super helpful in shaping the product!</p>

<p>The kids and I had a blast playing Baba is You this morning, and it brought up ancient memories of playing Sokoban puzzles  (where all you can do push crates around; in particular no pulling). Now I want to play Sokoban on my phone.</p>
<p><a href="https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/sir-box-a-lot">lcamtuf.coredump.cx/sir-box-a-lot</a> contains 300 publicly available Sokoban puzzles. It turns out the C syntax that those puzzles are encoded in is just a few search-and-replaces from being perfectly valid and usable Lua. So far I can render the starting state.</p>

<p>Re "beyond efficiency" podcast episode... I remember reading many years ago about this idea, maybe in Scientific American... Basically, evolved systems tend to be inefficient and full of redundancy, whereas designed systems are efficient and parsimonious... But many evolved systems can still function when many components are damaged</p>

<p>Software products are physical products. That's why they're hard to design and engineer!</p>
<p>The physicality of software is kept at arms-length in a vector-based design tool. Here, the strength and focus is on surface level aesthetics and exploration though mocks — many, many mocks. All needed. All useful. But a mock does not a product make. A mock is an incomplete story of software physics. Which brings us the other side of the spectrum...</p>
<p>The IDEs — the code editors. The product you ship is here, so "I guess someone has to go there". First challenge: To most people it's walls of inexplicable symbols and weird (even hostile?) punctuation. Then, with code, you're essentially play-acting as a computer. You have to "speak computer" fluently to feel at home here. It's a love/hate relationship of running programs in your head. Mostly failing to do so. Then learning to get better at debugging. Eureka moments of finally solving the puzzle that unlocks a bugfix! Endlessly restarting programs to reset state. Today, even after multiple decades of investment in IDEs, coding is still 100 times harder and less fun than it should be! How can we truly move the needle?</p>
<p>A traditional IDE deals with the how to fully describe the physics of a software system. Writing and editing algorithms. Managing data flows. Figuring out logic. Painting pixels. Sending data at the speed of light over the network. But the IDE doesn't actually let you  <em>see</em>  the program as it manifests to the user in the final medium. It's running somewhere else — the browser, on your phone. This is where vector-tools have the IDEs at least partially beat. Yes, they're just mocks, but the vector-tool tool  <em>sees</em>  the mocks alongside you. This changes your relationship with the tool. Thinking and touching — moving, dragging, scaling, rotating, duplicating — seamlessly blends on a canvas, and it just  <em>feels</em>   <em>good, even fun!</em>  IDEs and editing code as text offers none of those things with today's tools, and it just feels like... friction!</p>
<p>So the letter to Santa reads as follows:</p>
<p><em>Dear Santa, give me the best parts of a vector-based design tool, plus the best parts of an IDE, rolled into one — but with none of the downsides. Thanks!</em> </p>
<p>Christmas can't get here fast enough.</p>

<p>I'm getting more and more into a new… idea? Let's see if I can explain it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are programs, like photoshop, that are tools for artists. You can use them to make art. They're a digital equivalent of traditional art tools. The fact that they're digital has, just to give one example, enabled artists to easily do some things that used to be really hard. This has, in turn, changed the sort of art that gets made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are programs, like flash, that are tools for <strong><em>_</em></strong> to make tools for artists. (I'm leaving a blank there because… I could have said "programmers", but I actually want you to not think of them as programmers for a sec. Just go with me.) For example, in the late 00s, I worked as a ______ making tools for artists, and I used flash to do this, because it gave me a programming environment that was designed in tandem with a drawing environment. Really nice fit here. But flash wasn't really designed for people to make tools for artists. It was designed to be a tool for artists, but it was also programmable, which made it a good tool for making tools for artists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are —————, that are tools for making tools for <em><strong>_</strong> to make tools for artists. (I'm adding another blank. I could have said "programming languages", but I actually want you to not think of these  </em>—————s_  as programming languages for a sec. Just go with me.) For example, going to school, or reading books, or a good night's sleep, or taking a shower, or having a stimulating conversation with a friend. These are all —————, but they're outside the computer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Just as the computer allowed artists to have a new kind of tool that changed the sort of art that got made, I'm interested in how the computer might give us new kinds of ——————, which would in turn make new kinds of <strong><em>_</em></strong>__.</p>
<p>It's possible that FoC as a community is a —————. But I also think there's ————— software that's  <em>not</em>  a programming language.</p>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I have a big question about a programming-related problem I only partly understand, hoping not to get an answer, but rather pointers to where I should be looking. Here it goes.</p>
<p>For the past two years I have been working on SplootCode wanting to make code more accessible to non-engineers. The initial product (as is today) is basically a structured editor with drag and drop a-la-Scratch capabilities, and some other things to help non-engineers see and understand what the code is doing. You can see an example tiny program <a href="https://app.splootcode.io/shared/mattia/for-loops-example/EPdLhGOx7p1SbPDIDisgbfpV">here</a>.</p>
<p>During the interviews I conducted with several people, I bumped into a non-native English speaker who revealed their frustrations with having to learn English in order to code.</p>
<p>After speaking to another dozen non-native speakers - some of whom teach programming in non-English speaking countries using their native language - I figured that this is a really big problem for a lot people, and I want to solve it.</p>
<p>Since I have been deep into SplootCode for over two years, I am sure that I am suffering from sunk cost fallacy like crazy, thus the reason I am asking the question here is to get some outside perspective.</p>
<p>So, to solve the problem for people, I am wanting to address the nested problem that – AFAIK – the vast majority of programming languages, with the exclusion of any purely symbolic ones, are effectively a subset of the English language.</p>
<p>My first train of thoughts was: “perfect use case for building on top of SplootCode! The structured editing part means half the work is done already since I can label keywords however I want”.</p>
<p>Followed by: “but wait! how can this be actually solved so that anyone can use their own tool of choice, which is what people will need?”</p>
<hr>
<p>Thus my question is:</p>
<p>I believe that the proper solution is to add a  <em>layer</em> * to code – call the  <code>tongue</code>  layer – that defines the  <em>label</em> ** for each  <code>tongue</code> .</p>
<p><em>What do I need to understand thoroughly, in order to build such a solution? Who should I speak to?</em> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>layer</em>  intended as a standalone structure that doesn’t interact with anything but the semantic label of any literal, variable, operator, or function (or any other atomic structure that may exist within a programming language)</li>
</ul>
<p>** <em>label</em>  intended as the human-readable part of an atomic structure of a program. For example, the  <code>if</code>  in the structure  <code>if () {}</code>  in javascript, would be  <code>se</code>  in Italian, and  <code>もし</code>  in Japanese.</p>

<p><em>What's new this time? User-defined functions!</em>  There's one anonymous, single-use function at the top (the one that's passed to  <code>repeat()</code> ), and a function named  <code>clamp</code>  below that's written to be reused.  <em>Functions = Boxes.</em>  Lu took lines, but I think boxes are still available.</p>
<p><em>The writeup is here:</em> <a href="http://alltom.com/pages/ppl-lab-notebook/005.html">alltom.com/pages/ppl-lab-notebook/005.html</a> If you want to know the whys and the hows, it's for you. I  <em>love</em>  how the lab notebook / experiment writeup format gives me places to hang all the random things I'd like to write about. Design vicariously with me. 🙂</p>
<p>(Even if you don't have the time to read the writeup, I want you to know that I  <em>do not like</em>  how the clamp function's source code looks. I'm not done.

<p>The last couple of weeks I've been mainly focussing on the editing/creating of composition nodes in the visual programming system that I am building, which is more work than I expected. At least it's now possible to add input and output ports dynamically for existing compositions.</p>
<p>Since I also wanted to have some fun (and procastinate) I decided to implement a zoomable mandelbrot fractal in the gl-flow app, which can be seen in this little video <a href="https://youtu.be/y71c1IBBBsk">youtu.be/y71c1IBBBsk</a>. This also required some extra node-types and adjustments to the pull-based gl-flow engine. Like having support for a  for-loop-node which can be breaked out of depending on a condition. I implemented both the for-node as the condition as containers due to the way the pull-based engine works.</p>
<p>To give some background on the implementation of the pull-based flow engine which is used in the gl-flow app: the nodes get executed backwards starting at an end node and their output is glsl-code which can be run by a fragment shader on the gpu. So, the nodes themselves are not executed by the shader but the generated output is.</p>
<p>The spatial placement of the "end-nodes" is used to determine which node gets executed first and then the input nodes are executed backwards. A container is also an end-node. So, the contained nodes are executed in a code block.</p>
<p>I think the fractal renderer works quite nicely but you can't zoom very deep because of precision issues. I might try to solve these in the future, but my goal is not to make the perfect visual shadertoy😊.</p>

<p>Hey folks. I've been working on a VR ui for animation, inspired by Stop Drawing Dead Fish and a system called Projective Geometric Algebra. In this gif you can see me making something called a PGA Rotor, which is TLDR is an object that generalizes vectors and quaternions.</p>
<p><img alt="chrome-capture-2024-1-28.gif" src="http://history.futureofcoding.org/history/msg_files/F06/F06M15AMZ0B.gif"></p>
<p>You animate by making a bunch of these things, and then "snapping" them together, so they are joined end-to-end for example, and that becomes constantly-updated behaviour.  <em>Problem</em>  that I'd appreciate input on an idea for is how to visualize the "code"</p>
<p>Problem: my setup is already cluttered. Eg, animated characters are already surrounded by a halo of crazy clockwork; it's all I can do to hide it. But sometimes you want to see a lot of it. And I don't want to add boxes-and-arrows, and I don't want to add spreadsheets much either. I'm thinking that instead of showing the relations, I just let you fiddle with the things and see what happens</p>
<p>But maybe someone here has already tried this?</p>

<p>My 11yo son is learning the piano, and I rigged him a midi-&gt;raspberry pi-&gt;RGB LED strip so keys he plays light up then fade (it's a 144/m strip so nearly 2 leds per key).  </p>
<p>Now i'd like him to program he visualizer himself.  Tweak the colors, maybe do some analysis like recognize chords, try record/replay, maybe even ignore the music and make some game using the piano as input device?</p>
<p>He knows Scratch/Snap!, and wants to learn python (which my current script happens to already use), but the audio/visual nature here just screams "missed FoC/live coding opportunity" 😆 </p>
<p>What would you recommend?</p>

<p>A few years after I started programming I used to spend lots of free time tweaking my editor and shell configuration. After many years, I find I'm back to doing that 😕, only I then spend a few hours every few days trying to write up my configuration for imaginary others. This most recent post I'd never have gotten around to if I'd known how much proof-reading it would take.</p>

<p>I've taken a short break from my language, debugger, and editor to program my digital chess board (Chessnut air). I've been trying to learn/get better at chess for a while now and thought a digital chess board would be a great way to practice away from the computer. It is, except 1) bots don't play like people 2) the apps for the board suck. If fixed the first by using <a href="https://maiachess.com/">maiachess.com</a> a chess bot trained on Lichess data to play like real people (it's impressive). I also had to whip up a custom openings book. And 2 by writing my own software for the board. The bluetooth protocol was surprisingly simple (and luckily someone already reverse engineered it for me).</p>
<p>I think the most fun part about all of this has been building an interface in the chess board itself, rather than in an app. My program has no ui other than the chess board. Want to play a game as black, setup up the pieces, and pick up the black king. The game will start when you place it down. Setup a similar setup for choosing a unique starting position. The UI has changed everything for me. I use it now way more since I don't have to mess with an annoying app on my phone.</p>

<p>Help papa find her daughter</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My child is 3 years old. I was looking for a game that we could play together and would be her first programming-like activity. I wasn’t keen to teach her anything specifically but rather offer her the option to explore what coding or algorithmic thinking tasted like (similarly when you would give your child a sheet of paper, brush, and paint to play with). I evaluated some computer game options but I wished to find screen-free, unplugged alternatives, especially since she has not been used to interact with a computer or screen at all.</p>

<p>I started all this by saying PPLs were surprisingly visual and physical, so I'm concentrating on the interaction loop that I had in mind when I said those things: every time you edit a program, you see how it affects the distributions of data flowing through.</p>
<p>So in the attached GIF, there's a dataflow graph for a simple model where every few seconds I add an additional wire.</p>
<p>PPLs don't solve for a result—they  <em>converge</em> . So I expected the visualizations to have a very springy response to changes. And that's what I get! In fact, the juiciness of the program output contrasts so much with the stilted UI that I might have to resubscribe to some game design blogs sooner than later. 😬</p>
<p>But this is good. I have ideas for where to take the language that are milquetoast but implementable by me in my spare time, at a pace that I think should allow me to explore complex models within my lifetime.</p>

<p>I haven't been doing much coding lately (past ~4 months), so I'm doing a tiny side project to test out some new ways of working.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm converting an old CLJS project to TypeScript. I really wanted to authentically  <em>live in</em>  CLJS, but after months and months of trying, I never got over pain caused by the tooling. (This was back in ~2016, and I hear things have come a long way since. I'd give it another shot, but I no longer have much free time to learn languages/ecosystems.) I tried to get GPT to actually just convert the whole CLJS codebase. It was a mixed success. This is why I chose TypeScript, rather than (my preference) some dynamically-typed language. As it passes through an intentional state of  <em>chaotic mush</em> , I want as much  <em>structure</em>  as possible to be imposed upon my work. Once the conversion is done and I'm ready to resume work on the actual capabilities of the system, I'll probably gradually convert it to JS so that I can get away from needing a build step at all.</li>
<li>Inspired by <strong>@Maggie Appleton</strong>, I'm using native apps for Whisper and GPT. When I want to know how to do something, I just ramble out loud. Eg: "Does JavaScript have any syntax yet for iterating over the keys and values of an object without using object.entries?" I've found that for certain kinds of question, it feels really fluid. It might not be any faster than switching to my browser, typing <a href="http://mdn.io">mdn.io</a> followed by my query, and then scanning the page. But it often is, and even when it isn't it just feels really nice to get some help from the computer without having to touch the keyboard. (I have a weird relationship with my sense of touch — for instance, I really dislike touching anything made of metal and think we need to put all the metal back in the ground where it belongs, we've awoken a demon of unhindered conduction and are reaping the consequences, we're all damn fools — so it's nice to be able to converse directly with my computer without having to touch anything)</li>

<p>I've resigned myself to the fact that models in my language are going to get worse before they get better. There are things I love about this representation already, but I can already see it getting mired in "syntax".</p>
<p>I'll get to it. I want to work on model  <em>editing</em>  so badly that I'm just throwing in first drafts of the language features that I need in order to implement more interesting models as quickly as possible. I'm only a few away.</p>
<p>I added new entries in the lab notebook about <a href="http://alltom.com/pages/ppl-lab-notebook/003.html">why</a> and <a href="http://alltom.com/pages/ppl-lab-notebook/004.html">how</a>, and created this lovely GIF for you. This is a "trait attribution" model that infers whether an exam is fair based on an assumption about the base rate of exams being fair, and how many people pass. (Only one person took this particular test—and they failed. 😰) Cute and small.</p>

<p>Trying to see what I can do with the relational model, only supporting multi-model. Tagging each row of tables with a “model” identifier, much as temporal databases attach an interval or whatever to a row.</p>
<p>This would be give us a First Order Modal logic. I could have some fund pondering what various modal logics can do here (I’ve studied Modal Logic, but not recently). It occurred to me to ask about existing work in the area. At least what the concept is called, so I can go look for prior art.</p>
<p>Think of having a Datalog database and being able to set a “current model” or being able to do separate parts of queries in different models.</p>
<p>I’m also interested in the idea of merging multiple models to build new ones.</p>
<p>What should I look for?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFga2bfptBk">in this video</a> I show the progress on a new feature that I really wanted for quite some time: combining nodes into reusable compositions. This helps in making flows smaller. The compositions can be accessed from within the node-type selector so they can be added to the flow. One thing that I really like is how the inputs and outputs to compositions are created based on the connections which cross the bounds of the selected area. I've also finally added a way to copy &amp; paste nodes which is a nice productivity improvement. </p>
<p>In the video I demonstrate my other flow engine instance with which you can create fragment shaders in webgl and here I've recreated a shader form shadertoy made by kishimisu (see <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/mtyGWy">shadertoy.com/view/mtyGWy</a> ). I had to extend the node-types to make this possible. Currently I cant yet create nested compositions but once that is possible I hope it will help decrease the "node-spaghetti" further.

<p>I wanted to make a pit stop at this tug-of-war example from <a href="https://probmods.org/chapters/conditioning.html">ProbMods</a> before I moved on to working on the code editor because it's one of the most eye-opening in terms of what's possible in PPLs, and because  <em>this</em>  is the visual I wanted that I couldn't get in WebPPL, in two ways: 1) all the plots, arranged how I wanted them, and 2) always-on plots that let me see the samples as they come in, with the charts getting smoother and smoother the longer I'm willing to wait.</p>

<p>🗨️ Software Craftsmanship: The New Imperative via <strong>Dave Liepmann</strong></p>

<p>Pete McBreen's  <em>Software Craftsmanship: The New Imperative</em>  (2002).</p>
<p>Most of the book is about the consequences of distinguishing between "software engineering" (defined as armies of programmers going down a waterfall) and "software craftsmanship" (defined as small teams working incrementally). He runs deep with the craftsman metaphor, taking seriously how to make real the "apprentice" and "journeyman" stages in a software developer's career.</p>
<p>One interesting thread is that he points out how "best practices" are firmly a creation of the software engineering side of his binary, and do not satisfy craftspeople's very different trade-offs. Some by nature will wind around on their own path, custom-fitting each architectural decision to their preferences and the needs of the specific project.</p>
<p>There is overlap with our <a href="posts/future-of-coding-weekly-202402-week-2/?fromDate=2023-12-27&amp;toDate=2024-01-02&amp;channel=thinking-together&amp;filter=#2023-12-30T13:04:55.921Z">💬 #thinking-together@2023-12-30</a>, exploring <a href="https://twitter.com/jackrusher">Jack Rusher</a>'s ontology of [programming, computer science, software engineering]. It seems useful to me to further distinguish the "strong S.E." that Jack and McBreen use as definitional from the "soft S.E." which we all seem to use colloquially to mean all manner of techniques for making an application error-resistant. The work of the latter may not be intellectually engaging or novel but it lacks the qualities which make strong SE distasteful: centralization of power, treating developers interchangeably, the urge towards monoculture, a cultural belief in "training" instead of learning.</p>

<p>Is there an attempt at making a more beginner-friendly, perhaps graphical, form of prolog. Perhaps something like Squeak, but where the computation model is more logic programming than imperative, structured programming?</p>
<p>Or perhaps some other friendly presentation of logic programming?</p>

<p>I'm  <em>looking for the first team member</em>  for a natural language programming startup I've been working on since the beginning of 2021: <a href="https://levlo.com">levlo.com</a>.</p>
<p>The responsibilities can be defined based on experience and interests to fit somewhere between passionate frontend developer + designer and full-stack developer + product owner/chief product officer.</p>
<p>I live in Espoo, Finland, but we'd work mostly full-remote. However, due to bureaucracy, residence in Finland is required. Atm I have funding for 12 months of 4200€/month salary (with working time and benefits as defined by Finnish law) and will be offering equity on top. The goal is certainly to find funding for paying the salary going forward as well.</p>
<p>Since releasing the demo shown on the site, I've been working on rewritting large parts of the underlaying technology to be able to add features required by potential use-cases that have come up. Now, after ~5 months, I've finally been able to start adding those language features and start work towards enabling real world use-cases. Sales effort hase been fairly minimal so far, but I have one confirmed pilot customer (B2B) and will be putting more effort into sales going forward.</p>
<p>The techstack is C#, Azure and Blazor (similar to Vue). The most important skills would be web frontend development (&amp; design), cloud (Azure), and C#. In that order. The C# you'll need to write will be fairly trivial and it should be easy for anyone familiar with eg. Java or TypeScript to pick it up. But first and foremost I'm looking for someone passionate about the future of programming willing to embark on this hopefully decades long journey with me!</p>

<p>My PhD thesis about my ongoing attempts to marry AI and HCI is now up. (A lot of it is about academia, where those two fields  <em>do not like</em>  to talk.) Plenty of stuff about paper tools, rapid visualization prototyping, and the connection between domain-specific languages and direct-manipulation interfaces.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Author(s): Otto, Jasmine Tan | Advisor(s): Smith, Adam M | Abstract: Software instruments are intelligent interfaces used by domain experts to manipulate complex artifacts. By contributing the concept of software instruments, this thesis connects the field of data visualization to its relations in both artificial intelligence and computer-supported collaborative work. Software instruments arise from projects carried out by teams with complex datasets in aerospace and narrative design, whom I have worked closely with, and which are developed and documented in this thesis. They are a lens for other computational media practitioners to introspect about their own design processes and artifacts. I argue that the evaluation of software instruments occurs in discussion with expert stakeholders, adopting the lens of critical technical practice to avoid disciplinary silos and narrow strategies of evaluation.</p>

<p>We just open sourced this concept we've been working on for programming with LLMs we're calling Blueprints. It is kind of an alternative to coding copilots. It allows you to capture patterns/sections/chunks/classes/etc of your code to store as a "blueprint" then use those blueprints as a base template for generating something new - in your particular style. Think about it similarly to how when you work on a new feature, a lot of the time there's similar code in your codebase that you look at and modify for this new use case you're working on.</p>
<p>The way it works is that when you capture a blueprint, the server generates a description with GPT4 along with vector embeddings of that description so that the next time you want to do something you just need to describe it, it finds the closest description, and uses the description+code to prompt for the new code generation.</p>

<p>Hey y'all. I'm working towards a library for rendering and adding direct-manipulation to infinite recursive things. I want to share this picture showing where I'm at.</p>
<p>On the left is the rendered infinite recursive thing. On the right is the diagrammatic specification for the thing on the left. The library interprets the diagrammatic spec and produces a program that takes the initial transformation (position, rotation, scale, and skew) of a shape (data for a  <code>t</code>  in the diagram), and then runs forever, adding more shapes to the left and the right as it runs.</p>
<p>The arrows in the spec mean "depends on", and the lines mean "depends on" both ways. I could have drawn the lines as two-sided arrows but I found that it was harder to read. Explaining this now I realize its kind of confusing tho lol.</p>
<p>The self-loop on the  <code>t</code>  in the spec is what makes the resulting diagram recursive, otherwise it would be a single red, green, and blue thing.</p>
<p>Currently the diagrammatic spec is actually specified in text 😐</p>

<p>Just curious for all your thoughts, is being ahead of your time a good thing? I’m thinking of a conversation I had with <strong>@Toby Schachman</strong> in the Cuttle discord a while back where he mentioned that Cuttle aimed certain details at a status-quo of programming style unlike it’s predecessor Apparatus, I thought that was quite profound. I’m thinking also of Fortran vs Lisp (or perhaps Forth). When is it  <em>not</em>  worth it to meet people where they are?</p>

<p>I wanted to bounce 2 terms I've been thinking of off of this group:</p>
<p>I dig visual programming, but think the term is like a little bit of a brain poison because it isn't really descriptive of the goals, and, like, almost all textual programming is inherently visual, too...just...in the way text is.</p>
<p>I think <a href="http://ivanish.ca/">Ivan Reese</a> was the person I first heard float the term "spatial programming," which I dig, but at least for me, it also misses the real value add of what I'm looking for in a "visual" system.</p>
<p>So, the two terms I've been kicking around:</p>
<ul>
<li>relational programming</li>
<li>cartographic programming</li>
</ul>
<p>Neither are perfect, and both feel exhaustingly pretentious (a good thing, may haps?) but my intention with both terms is to highlight that these sorts of systems, unlike text-based programming, help make the relationships between different elements (classes, data flow, inheritance, etc.) meaningful using information other than similar names.</p>
<p>Useful? Stupid? Prior art?</p>

<p>Given recent discussion of  <em>what social scientists need from computing</em> (and is it plain-text scripting?), sharing this recent survey of cultural heritage visualization systems (16p). Section 3.4 (Granularity and Interactivity) will be especially interesting; the authors avoid flattening this idea to a 'file system'.</p>

<p>Another one of those developer thriving comics from pluralsight’s research folks. I like that this one hits on contest culture, and its relationship to AI. (also, love that the PDF includes accessible text)</p>

<p>Whoa.  Similar to <a href="https://twitter.com/TodePond">Lu Wilson</a>'s probabilistic rule-driven VMs,</p>
<p>plus a touch of Orca?  (Specifically the way the kid  <em>built</em>  a timer out of a character pacing back and forth, see around 11:10-14:30)</p>
<p>I particularly love the use of user-drawn icons in lieu of symbols.  Naming is hard (and requires literacy).</p>

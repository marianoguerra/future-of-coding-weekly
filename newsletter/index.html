<p>The people using my software as a back-end for their web project are running machines that are not allowed to use docker, but are allowed to use "podman". Podman does not implement the feature of docker-compose.yml files that allows you to build an image from a github repository. So this week I need to learn how to publish docker images of my alpha software that nearly no one uses. Having users is the best/worst.</p>

<p>Hi everyone, I’ve been thinking about using hypertext instead of text files as the medium to represent programs  <em>and their executions</em> .</p>
<p>Programs contain a lot of cross references that are resolved only after the parser/runtime have had a go. IDEs also redo this parsing work to simulate the same cross references for easy editing. The idea is to embed these references in the medium itself. So, get rid of import statements, file boundaries and such. Each textual reference - function name, type name, any identifier really - would be link to the object it references. Unlike strongly structured environments, this allows some flexibility in representing partial and possibly invalid structures. I’m interested in implementations you know of that match this idea.</p>

<p>Recently, I realised that despite “vaguely knowing” what <a href="http://www.vpri.org/">VPRI</a> was doing (and trying to do), I never bothered to thoroughly read <a href="https://tinlizzie.org/IA/index.php/Papers_from_Viewpoints_Research_Institute">their reports and papers</a>. Now that I took the time to read them, I feel like overall it’s been time well spent (I got inspiration and encouragement for some projects).</p>
<p>I’d like to know if you know about the VPRI undertaking, and if you do, whether you read (some of) their papers/reports - see poll below. I’m also interested in similar experiences you had with other projects (thinking you know what they do, then having this understanding deepened by looking at their work more carefully).</p>

<p>When the industry switched over from mainframes and minicomputers to personal computers, how big a regression was the performance of a typical PC versus that of a mainframe / mini at the time?

<p>The assumptions is that an <em>infinite canvas is great for creative / generative tasks</em> .</p>
<p>But then  <em>for processing a linear workflow, might be better / more natural / impose less cognitive burden</em> .</p>

<p>I've been developing documentation for my language. The nice thing about it is that all the code snippets are embedded editor instances that allow you to run and play with the examples.</p>
<p>This week I've been writing a page to document effect types. There one of the key features of it. I've made a video where I play around with them.</p>

<p>My overall goal for the year is to —finally— learn how to do real work on the GPU. As a motivating short-term goal, I'm building a visualization of magnetic fields, as VFX for a video about regenerative braking that my company is producing. I'm doing all this (bear with me) inside a new drawing app that I'm developing, which heretofore rendered to SVG, but which I'd like to abstract so that it can render in a more API-agnostic way, as a prelude to making it portable (with an eye to Swift+Metal, perhaps eventually Vision Pro). Then (continue to bear with me) I'll have a nice foundation for continuing some of my visual programming experiments. So no, these screenshots here aren't  <em>strictly</em> FoC-relevant. But it is stuff that I'm building as a test case… within a new graphics tech stack that I'm building… with a goal of supporting some new visual programming stuff that I'd like to do.</p>
<p>I won't be posting much stuff here until it becomes more directly FoC relevant, but if you'd like to follow along regardless I'll be <a href="https://mastodon.social/@spiralganglion">posting more regularly on Mastodon</a>.</p>

<p>Aside: Magnetic fields are actually 4D phenomena (x/y/z/t).  We use equations to think about fields by reducing fields to 2D so that we may scribble our thoughts down onto clay tablets and papyrus.  There is this new medium - called “computers” - that might let us break free of 2D-only expression of 4D phenomena, using, say, 3D (x/y/t) while expressing the 4th D (z) using a trick that humanity invented, called “perspective”.  Fields might be more-than-4D phenomena but our brains can only perceive 4 dimensions at this time.</p>

<p>when you all work on a Future of Cod <em>ing</em>  flavored tool, do you think about ways to bake in certain sorts of interactions.</p>
<p><em>As example:</em> </p>
<p>React lets ya build accessible, localized experiences, but it also lets ya make something that is wholly inaccessible, too. It is sort of agnostic on that front. Could a tool “force” an accessible experience, or be more strongly biased towards something like that?</p>
<p>This line of thinking isn’t restricted to accessibility, it just seemed like an easy fruit to reach for when writing an example. Is this the kinda thing other folks think about when designing stuff? Do you have examples of it?</p>

<p>Generating initial content for an any workspace.</p>
<p><em>We are, by design, about non-linear explorations, in that setting it’s not always easy to start.</em> </p>
<p>A bit like sitting in front of a blank page. This feature is like priming / toning the canvas 😉</p>
<p>I personally think visually a lot of the time (spatially / moving pictures), but  <em>the</em>   <em>trigger for starting a thread of thought is quite often a word, term, phrase or a sentence</em> .</p>
<p>This feature is about that kind of exploration, you drop a word and it ripples out into all kinds of useful directions.</p>
<p>(of course, being useful is the trick here, this is very minimal atm)</p>
<p>The way the app is set-up it’s not difficult for us to generate those workspaces (the blocks are Clojure maps in a re-frame db), so if it turns out that it’s useful we’ll probably generate more content.</p>

<p>Not my main work, but a fun little programming project that's relevant in a number of ways, despite apparently being more about the Past of Coding, than the Future.</p>
<p>I wrote a small (&lt;500 lines of code) BASIC to JS compiler, that lets me run the programs from the class book <em>101 BASIC Computer Games</em> from 1978. It's interesting for two reasons I think: 1. for those who want to learn about languages and compilers, this provides a very simple example 2. philosophically, I think BASIC really exemplifies the Worse is Better approach outlined by  Richard Gabriel and covered in a FOC podcast. It is a terrible language in many ways, but it was small enough to be stored in a 4k ROM and be used to to useful things on an early microcomputer with only 4k of RAM. If we had waited for machines with enough memory to run Lisp, Smalltalk or Algol, the microcomputer revolution would have been delayed by a decade or more.

<p>I’ve been sketching multiplayer UIs. Folks who came to the most recent London meet will recognise these from my demo. I’m trying not to converge on anything right now — how we interact with AI NPCs is still so open.</p>

<p>To give some scope:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In asking “What is live coding?,” our intention is not to fix or define but rather to explore how live coding  <em>opens up</em> . Live coding is about people interacting with the world, and each other, in real time, via code. Live coding is about making software  <em>live</em> .</p>
<p>The first part is more practice focused, offering an account of the origins, development, and aspirations associated with the evolution of live coding alongside presenting documentation and examples of live coding practice. The second part is more speculative and conceptual in its register, allowing space for discussion of the many ways live coding reflects and informs wider cultural and political concerns.</p>

<p>This might fall under "thinking-together", but I'm throwing this here as it specifically relates to AI. For context, I've been working to integrate an LLM into an existing application.  If "prompt engineering" is part of the future of coding, here are some challenges to expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Non determinism:</em> I can repeat a prompt and get back drastically different results, in both content and format.</li>
<li>
<em>Capabilities:</em> I feel like I'm constantly probing to discover the capabilities and limits of the model. Every interaction is similar to being presented with a blank canvas: What should I ask? What can I ask? Is there something that I could ask that I am forgetting about? Can I reword my prompt slightly and (potentially) get better results? This leads to a lot of experimentation.</li>
<li>
<em>Expectations</em>: We are tricked into believing the LLM comprehends what we are saying, when it's really just a giant prediction table. Then we are disappointed when it gives less-than-satisfactory replies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Compare this to programming against a traditional API:</p>
<ul>
<li>On in the input side, an API constrains the vocabulary. With an LLM, everything is fair game.</li>
<li>On the output side, I can guess (or learn) the effect of a given API call. With an LLM, it's all probabilistic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Curious about others experiences here, ways to reason about these models, techniques for overcoming, etc...</p>

<p>HitchStory is an open source bolt-on for pytest that, lets you build integration tests which autogenerate scenario-based documentation about your app.</p>
<p>The tests are written in type-safe StrictYAML. In the website example, running the tests generates screenshots and a GIF of the user story from playwright. These are all combined into step-by-step markdown documentation that non developers can follow that explain how your app works.</p>

<p>I am going to need to come up with a more robust way to allow my users to edit legislative text in a way that is user friendly, and forces them to stick to a predefined data structure. I'm wondering if anyone has tried to use tools like slate.js or ProseMirror for that sort of thing, or have other suggestions.

<p>Software Engineers do not write code.</p>
<p>Implementors (coders) write code.</p>
<p>Engineers think (deeply) about what code needs to be written, and, what trade-offs need to be made to simply make the system work.</p>
<p>Production Engineers think about making trade-offs so that the system is “efficient” along one or more dimensions (speed, space, cost, etc.), but, only after the initial system is working and shown to satisfy end-users’ needs.</p>
<p>Current popular programming languages, like Rust, Haskell, Python, etc., conflate all of these issues together, thus,  making the code more difficult to design.  Conflating issues together like this has a name: “cottage industry”.</p>
<p>Then, there’s Software Architecture, Maintenance, Testing, Q/A, Security, etc., etc.</p>
<p>The above pattern is visible in other, older professions, such as building construction.  Software might re-use these ideas and re-purpose them for creating electronic machines.</p>
<p>Note, too, that more-established professions use diagrams to augment the use of written words when communicating designs (blueprints, schematics, molecular diagrams, etc.).</p>
<p>Note, too, that more-established professions use elements that are completely isolated and decoupled from one another.  This assumption (of inherent non-coupling) is violated by most popular programming languages.</p>

<p>This is a relatively simple concept but I think it’s quite powerful.</p>
<p>In Nette  <em>we try to allow users to grab anything that looks like interesting information</em>  and then drop it on canvas (we will turn it into the right type of blocks).</p>
<p>Here we have “X-Ray” 😎</p>
<p>Essentially Named Entity Recognition, which  <em>adds affordances to recognised phrases</em> —you can then drop any of them onto the canvas and we’ll try to make a  <em>Definition</em>  block out of it.</p>
<p>This is what it looks like 🙂</p>

<p>Lamdu now elaborates on non-trivial type errors!</p>
<p>In the screenshot several type errors are demonstrated:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple one: Text isn’t Num</li>
<li>“Occurs check”:  <code>func func</code>  means that the type of  <code>func</code>  is infinitely  <code>(((a -&gt; a) -&gt; a) -&gt; a) -&gt; …</code>  (note it can be done if wrapping in a nominal type to break the loop</li>
<li>Expand-record when inside record has the same fields. The message here isn’t yet very informative to which field is duplicated. Just says “constraints” for now</li>
<li>Scoped type variable escape (i.e “skolem”) error. This is equivalent to leaking Haskell’s  <code>ST</code>  monad’s  <code>s</code>  variable</li>
</ul>

<p>Just a small clip to show a stress test I've worked on for my new visual programming system.. maybe not super impressive, but at least it is performing better then my old system. It uses purely DOM, svg and css (transforms).</p>
<p>Creating all the nodes from javascript takes still quite long, they do all have different shapes though (using css clip-path).</p>

<p>I'm currently thinking about whether Product Managers (or other non-coder end users) can be able to make direct changes to native product without Engineers.  In the companies I've been at, there's been paper cuts and requests that engineers make to the product, which are time-consuming, tedious and take away from actual product/infra development.</p>
<p>If there are guardrails that Engineers define on certain parts of the product, are there any problems to this idea?  Curious what others think and/or have seen</p>

<p>I've been working on a specification for better, networked bookmarks.</p>
<p><em>A problem I'm currently facing:</em>  I share a lot of links. I have a channel on my Slack workspace called #walkers-claptrap where I share anything / everything that I find noteworthy. It's a bit like <strong>#linking-together</strong>. That said, not everyone I share bookmarks with (and short remarks about them) are at work, so I'm frequently duplicating and sharing over multiple lines of communication (texting, social media, slack, etc). Even then, those channels aren't easily traversed and are organized linearly. I don't love sorting things by date when their value isn't directly scoped to time. I'd also prefer to publish some place that I own and syndicate elsewhere, so that rules out Twitter.</p>
<p><em>semi-solution:</em> The claptrap specification. A graph of links / small notes. The edges are based on relationships or membership with some group. A claptrap MUST be hosted plaintext and MAY be accessed with curl or similar tool (sort of like Carmack's .plan files). A claptrap MAY expose an RSS of updates to syndicate to channels etc. A claptrap MAY reference external claptrap nodes to network / branch beyond the local graph.</p>
<p>Still very much a work in progress. Does anyone have a similar problem; do you have a solution you like? I want to bridge the gap between "personal knowledge base" and "sharing links into the ether"</p>

<p>Hey all! I need a tool / stack suggestion. We'd like to track internal metrics for development like build performance stats, build size, source control size, etc. I'd like to be able to see these trends in a graph by date/commit.</p>
<ul>
<li>CI tools can do some of this, but they only surface a small, inconfigurable set of metrics. Usually just test failures and build times.</li>
<li>There are monitoring solutions like Grafana Cloud, Datadog, but these all seem geared towards monitoring servers and cloud systems. They also assume you're ingesting massive amounts of data.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I really just want is a POST-able URL that I can spit metrics to, and a dashboard with some basic alerting. Is there something like this that exists?</p>

<p>Attending a conference today and yesterday about Blockly, the visual code editing environment. Big push toward bi-drectionality between code and blocks. For integration with existing code-bases, AI generation, collaboration with people not using visual editors, etc. At least two different approaches being investigated or used, and I would be inclined to use a completely different one. They don't realize it, but some of their problems are solved by some of the tools people here are working on. Like how do you make it so that you can generate blocks when the text is in an invalid state? Much easier to just avoid invalid states, like Blockly does! How can you avoid invalid states if the person isn't finished typing, and there are mandatory subnodes in the AST? Much easier to fill holes by default, like Blockly does. Essentially, they can't get to bidirectionality, because the text editing experience is structurally unaware. It's not possible with VSCode, but it is possible with Tylr, or anything that imposes a structure. Even ProseMirror would work better. But there is no need to stop at two concrete syntaxes, if you can sacrifice interface specific details (e.g. whitespace in text, grid position in Blockly), or keep them where they live (linter settings, a database of block locations outside the AST), you can operate directly on the AST in whatever tool you want. Has anyone played with a "headless" AST that could be used that way? It feels like all structural editors need one, particularly if they hope to facilitate collaborative editing. Has anyone tried putting two different coding interfaces over the same shared AST?</p>

<p>Addendum to the above, <a href="https://dynamicland.org/docs/2023-04-27-Communal-computing-for-21st-century-science.pdf">this PDF</a> on the Dynamicland site. Starts with a bang.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nobody asked for the invention of the graphical user interface. It wasn’t on any national research agenda. There was no demand from users — they were a small cadre of professionals using computing for specialized technical tasks, and accepted command-driven textual interfaces as simply what it meant to use a computer. There was no demand from the public — most people never expected to touch a computer in their lives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concepts around directly manipulating information arranged spatially on a screen were invented unbidden by a small group of visionaries, particularly in the research groups of Doug Engelbart and Alan Kay in the 1960s and 1970s. They believed that computing could be more than just number crunching, that it could serve as a medium for all people to see and discuss ideas, if only those ideas could be represented in visible, manipulable forms.</p>
<p>I haven't read the rest of the PDF yet, but it looks to go into a fair bit more detail about their vision for the "21st Century Science Lab" than what was hinted at in the video.</p>

<p>Alright, so we have the above  <em>visionary</em>  approach to spatial computing where you can actually touch and feel the computable things, your body is fully present in the computable space — assuming the dream comes true and it ever takes off — versus the now all-too-inevitable <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/">Vision</a> where you don't even get to <a href="http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/">touch glass</a>, your body is so absent that they have to make a <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/metahuman">meta human</a> out of you. Here's hoping the latter doesn't take the wind out of the sails of the former.</p>
<p>I'm curious to see what sorts of programming tools Apple has come up with for Vision. I'm assuming it'll be the same old Swift, SwiftUI, and Xcode (now in a spatial window), but maybe there'll be some hint of novelty in Reality Composer Pro or some other accessory tooling. But I'm far, far more interested in seeing what we all can come up with.</p>

<p>Does anyone have suggestions for a snapshot history UX for multi-dimensional data (like Excel, but with more dimensions)? It seems that most implementations for Figma, Google Workspace, and Microsoft Office 365 are pretty basic, but maybe that’s all people expect, so it’s not worth the effort to try to be clever. What do others think? I’d be pretty curious for people to suggest products which were able to “double count” the typical “snapshot” UX by thoughtfully pairing it with another need like audit-ability. For example: Procreate has a way to see the timelapse of changes to a piece of art over time. Or, you could use snapshots as a way to tell a story with data, by selecting interesting snapshots to be used as “key frames” in a presentation.</p>

<p>I finally had occasion to try out Obsidian today. Some notes after 5 minutes of use.</p>
<ul>
<li>The initial experience is a blank screen without bullets. I thought the outliner view was the #1 selling point of such tools? Do people use Obsidian to write free-form text?</li>
<li>I can copy a set of nested bullets from Obsidian to LogSeq and it works great. In the other direction, though, Obsidian loses all the nested structure I copied from LogSeq.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall the experience has been surprising. The open source clone felt like a more polished onboarding experience than the relatively proprietary and centrally coordinated product. I'm curious if that matches other people's experience.</p>

<p>Ugh. I have discovered that a library exists for building a UI I have wanted for ~6 years, and I have fallen into a prototyping rabbit hole, fighting a language and a framework I'm unfamiliar with, plus good code with bad documentation. I've never seen anyone spill this many pixels on documentation and fail to mention how it is installed, fail to give a step-by-step hello world, and create dozens of examples none of which can actually be followed successfully without spending hours researching and deducing what it would have taken mere minutes to type out.

The project which I was working on before had too much dependencies and limited me too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkL3cFjx8XA">This is the first progress that I can share</a>. It's just a little demo showing a very small flow where you can see moving data points over the wires and changing the speed, there's no timeline yet (yes, I was inspired by Hest.. although <a href="http://ivanish.ca/">Ivan Reese</a> 's gifs still look way better offcourse 😊). I am building this without runtime dependencies (react or other framework is not used, pure vanilla javascript with my custom jsx transformer).</p>

<p>I think we need many different little languages and a substrate “language” (kernel) to bolt them all together.</p>
<p>Note that, in electronics, there is/was something called “design rules” which is something more-than-type. In web-site design, one uses “input validation” which is like type-checking but on a very per-project basis. It would be nice to be able to bolt design-rule checkers together using a palette of existing components. Again, it seems that one should want a palette of components to help build up design rule checkers and completely different palette of components to build up actions. I would expect to use different “syntaxes” for each concern and would expect to use IDE layers to deal with each kind of issue separately then let the IDE automagically stitch them together. This is just another way of saying “I would like to use a different language (SCN in my words) to deal with each kind of issue”. Would I use text-based SCNs exclusively? No. But, for text-based SCNs, I would use Ohm-JS and for diagrammatic SCNs I would start by using <a href="http://draw.io">draw.io</a>. Both kinds of syntaxes are “easy” now, so there is no reason not to build project-specific SCNs. We have been indoctrinated to believe that “one language to rule them all” GPLs is the way to go. I don’t agree.</p>

<p>Just had a meeting with my user. Singular. He's been busy writing code, and the code is working, and he's starting to feel competent with the tool. So I have a guy trained as a lawyer doing legal knowledge representation in a constraint answer set programming language, without help, and validating that code as accurate with the help of other non-coders. Zero to one. Woo! 🎉</p>

<p>Since getting laid off at shopify, I've been trying to do a bit more on side projects. I've been streaming building an arm assembler that is serving as the basis for a programming language I want to build. At the simplest level, I want a dynamically typed language that compiles straight to machine code (not aot). But ultimately, I want this to serve as a platform for experimenting with features a lot of languages don't have.</p>
<p>Off stream I've been working on my editor, right now learning the bare minimum of shaders so I can play with some effects and think about ways an editor could look and work.</p>
<p>If anyone has thoughts or ideas on either of these topics, happy to hear them.</p>

<p>...“Computer” is a Misnomer, “Function” is a Misnomer, “CPU” is a Misnomer, Mathematics Notation, Verbatim, How?...</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to enable the use of diagrams as syntax (DaS).  This is but a step in that direction.</p>
<p>... “RT” is like assembler with a recursive syntax, instead of a line-oriented syntax ...</p>

<p>I enjoyed this assessment.  I lived through the shift to recursion. I note, though, that recursion and functions make sense only for single-threaded pieces of hardware which is how CPUs and Memory were perceived in the 1950s.  Today, we can have bowls full of CPUs with their own local memories, which changes the ground truth about hardware.  While it is possible to extrapolate recursion to describe distributed systems, the recursive  mind-set leads to epicycles such as thread safety, multi-tasking operating systems, thread libraries, loops, etc., i.e. a generally horrible DX (Developer eXperience) for creating distributed programs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Structured editing can show benefits in learnability, tool building, and editing efficiency in programming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, creating a usable structured editor is laborious and demanding, typically requiring tool builders to manually create or adjust editing interactions.</p>
<p>We present Sandblocks, a system that allows users to automatically generate structured editors for every language with a formal grammar available.</p>
<p>Our system's input reconciliation process acts on arbitrary syntax trees to provides consistent interactions across our generated editors.</p>
<p>Our editors' editing experience is designed to be familiar to users from textual editing but, compared to previous work, requires no manual annotation in the grammars.</p>

<p>Welp, I let my desire for novelty get the best of me, spent two days making cosmetic changes that weren't actually needed for anything, spent another two days digging myself out from under all the bugs I created in the process. Then I started work on the thing I should actually have been doing on Monday, and it's noon on Friday and the half-fix I have implemented has created other, worse problems than the problem I'm trying to fix. So a week has gone by, and the tool LOOKS way better, and WORKS way worse. Yay, I guess.</p>

<p>Been thinking about the infra needed for human-machine teaming, I think a lot of knowledge from the field of business process management can be reimagined, just with powerful natural language capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural language becomes the API interface between humans and machines.</li>
<li>No need to formally describe the workflow. Just talk to it and let the LLM create/modify/delete these.</li>
<li>These workflows are essentially Turing-complete, distributed program where the job "processors" are people and bots. For eg: BPMN already supported branching, sequential processing, parallel processing etc.</li>
<li>Open-source Zapier-equivalent systems can be a good starting point for these.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finished a version with event reasoning, didn't even really have a chance to test it before realizing there is at least one more missing feature needed for my current project, namely predicates with an arity of greater than 2. Added that as a feature to the block language and the reasoner on Monday. Added it to the API for the reasoner yesterday. Today I need to implement it in the "Scenario Editor" which allows users to describe facts, run queries against those facts, and display the results. Absolutely dreading it. Wish me luck.</p>

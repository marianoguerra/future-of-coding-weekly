<p>I posted a longer version of this above, but I don't think I introduced it very well! It's a stab at Stop Drawing Dead Fish in VR with spreadsheets and something called Geometric Algebra (GA) also known as Clifford Algebra.</p>
<p>Those who have scrutinized Stop Drawing Dead Fish(SDDF) closely might have noticed two references to GA. Bret also used to have a "Geometric Algebra" sticker on his laptop! But while GA is a very Bret thing, he actually did not  <em>use</em>  it to make SDDF, so my thing is trying to make good on that.</p>
<p>GA is a mathematical system where you get a bunch of geometric objects and transformations, and they all get related to one another by math that is quite a lot simpler than usual. For example, in the conventional/non-GA approach, if you wanted a line in 3D space you'd take two "vectors" v1 and v2 and say the line is the set of vectors v1+t*v2 for all scalars t. This can be kinda useful, but gets complicated if you ask for a simple thing like a rotation around that line. In the GA way of doing things, instead of being "a set of vectors", a line is its own sort of object - lines can be added together; multiplied by planes and rotations; etc. Lots of useful operations turn out to be examples of this, I've attached a pdf of examples.</p>
<p>"doing math/programming by working directly with (tangible/visualizable) geometric objects instead of with linear equations" should strike you as a centrally Bret thing. But why didn't he use it? I'll say in a comment under this message.</p>

<p>Exploring Techniques and Notations for Augmenting DX</p>

<p><a href="https://history.futureofcoding.org/history/weekly/2024/07/W1/share-your-work.html#2024-06-28T20:29:33.026Z">🧵 conversation</a></p>
<p>In my demo, I made the statement "... t2t doesn't need the full power of OhmJS ...", but, I didn't clarify.</p>
<p>For t2t - text to text transpilation - primarily, you need to pattern-match incoming text, then emit text based on the input.</p>
<p>OhmJS parses incoming text, then gives you the full power of JavaScript to do anything you want with the parse tree.</p>
<p>For t2t, you don't need to resort to class hierarchies, functions, closures, etc., etc. You primarily need to pattern match, then, create and modify text. In addition to OhmJS' ability to pattern-match, Javascript's "template strings" are about all you need - the ability to create text and to interpolate text from the tree walk of the parsed input.</p>
<p>This  <em>seems</em>  to be unnecessarily restrictive, but, turns out to be quite powerful and mind-freeing. Fewer options -&gt; less clutter -&gt; increased ability to think about interesting issues. After all, "simplicity" == "lack of nuance", and, my goal is to simplify DX.</p>
<p>[Infrequently, one needs to do a tiny bit more (like gensym() a new symbol and leave it on a scoped stack for use during the tree-walk), so I provide a way to break out and call a Javascript function, but, this kind of power is not needed in most cases. I guess that, in the future, I will restrict this some more, but, I'm still experimenting].</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/LayMwCIQAnM">In this video</a> you can see the progress I made on opening up codeflowcanvas so that it is embeddable in other frameworks/libraries like Astro/Angular and React. I've restructured some of the packages that the project uses and published these to NPM. You can see the embedding of codeflowcanvas on its own website using a custom StorageProvider for loading json files from a javascript bundle: <a href="https://www.codeflowcanvas.io/devlog/embedded-codeflowcanvas/">codeflowcanvas.io/devlog/embedded-codeflowcanvas</a> .</p>
<p>This goal of this restructuring is to get codeflowcanvas out of its own silo on various way (for example in the future I want to be able to design flows in a vscode editor and use these together with other framework/libraries without embedding the editor and just run the flows).</p>
<p>A feature that is also made possible by the above is being able to export to external formats like tldraw and the OpenCanvas work-in-progress spec (see <a href="https://www.canvasprotocol.org/">canvasprotocol.org</a>). Different strategies can be implemented to provide different formats.</p>

<p>I'm becoming interested in the idea of "programming tools as art", and as a consequence I'm interested in programming tools criticism.</p>
<p>I'd like to read/watch/hear critical reviews of programming tools that approach them not as bundles of features and capabilities, but as authored works that reflect a creative intent and as cultural touchstones and as environments or artifacts within which one can have deeply personal experiences.</p>
<p>A. Do you share my interest?</p>
<p>B. Do you know any such critics?</p>

<p>Who'd be interested in an event with talks and some performances around making notations and programming languages for pattern-making (textile, musical, choreographic etc)? Half focussed online, half focussed in-person, all streamed. Mix of open call and invited talks. All free/open access. Probably in January. Maybe called "Programming Of The Art Computer".</p>

<p>51:21 suppressing the present to see different ways to address the future</p>
<p>51:35 “semaphore” is a “bad idea”, pseudo-time is superior, but never got used over last 30 years</p>
<p>54:10 Nile Graphics Language by Dan Amelang is a dataflow language and is very small. Expresses how to define shapes using pixels in only 45 lines of code.</p>
<p>54:51 - Bret Victor at VPRI</p>
<p>57:59 all compositing rules, including alpha-blending, is expressed in 95 LOC</p>
<p>59:16 whole graphics system, equivalent to what is needed on a PC, is expressed in 435 LOC</p>
<p>1:01:00 - Code has to be transformed into CPU-speak</p>
<p>1:01:38 - we need a “language transforming language” [[pt] At present, I use the term “t2t” (text to text)]</p>
<p>1:01:58 - OMeta2 [[pt] OhmJS is an ancestor of OMeta2]</p>
<p>1:02:58 Using OMeta to make Nile, parser 130 LOC, LLL 730 LOC</p>
<p>1:06:00 TCP/IP expressed in 160 LOC</p>
<p>1:20:24 POLs == Problem Oriented Languages [[pt] I use the term SCN - Solution Centric Notation]</p>
<p>1:37:37 hardware is just software that is crystallized early [[pt] I say it another way: software is just soft hardware]</p>

<p>Here’s an article I wrote on a visual dataflow language modality where the execution of the graphical dataflow dynamically constructs the dataflow graph that is itself executing. (It’s similar to how Elixer functions can output AST for the function instead of the result and one can alternate between AST via quote/unquote)</p>

<p>If you're anything like me (oof, sorry), you've heard of <a href="https://worrydream.com/refs/Smith_DC_1975_-_Pygmalion.pdf">Pygmalion</a> but never caught more than the gist. Some sort of project from the early 70s, similar to Sketchpad or Smalltalk or something, yet another promising prototype from the early history of our field that failed to take the world by storm. Our stock-in-trade on this show.</p>
<p>But you've probably heard of Programming by Demonstration. And you've certainly heard of  <em>icons</em>  — you know, those little pictures that have become indelibly part of computing as we know it. Pygmalion is the originator of these concepts… and more!</p>
<p>The best introduction to Pygmalion is <a href="https://twitter.com/warianoguerra">Mariano Guerra</a>'s <a href="https://instadeq.com/blog/posts/no-code-history-pygmalion-1975/">No-code History: Pygmalion</a>, which includes a clearly articulated summary of the big ideas, motivation, and design, with a video demonstration of the programming interface, key terminology, and links.</p>
<p>The  <em>most</em>  introduction to Pygmalion — or Pig Million, The Millionth Pig, as it'll surely come to be known — is the subject of today's episode: the original paper by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Canfield_Smith">David Canfield Smith</a>.</p>

<p>I've just learned about Alternate Reality Kit. I've searched through the archive and it was mentioned in passing a couple of times but I don't think this article was ever posted: <a href="https://worrydream.com/refs/Smith_R_1987_-_Experiences_With_The_Alternate_Reality_Kit,_An_Example_of_the_Tension_Between_Literalism_and_Magic.pdf">Experiences With The Alternate Reality Kit
An Example of the Tension Between Literalism and Magic</a> . There is also a relatively recent video upload (video comes from 87 but it was uploaded only three years ago) which shows a more mature version in action: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1HhPE0zV6g">The Alternate Reality Kit</a> .</p>
<p>Its similarity to the system that I'm developing is just uncanny! I'm very interested in learning more about it. I tried to follow its history to figure out why it was abandoned but I've only been able to track that its development eventually led to the Self language (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ka4KY7TMTU">Self and Self: Whys and Wherefores</a>) which honestly seems like a step back from the original. I have my theories about why it might have been abandoned (which is that educational software is hard to sell) but would love to learn more about it from the people who might know more. Or maybe there are other systems that might have been derived from it?</p>

<p>I don't know, but I have my hypothesis as well as for why this and other user-empowering approaches were abandoned: the rise of PCs. In the late 80s and early 90s, the first PCs appeared and were seen as the obvious road to computing for everyone. But they were not powerful enough to run environments like Smalltalk. It's Basic we got instead. In parallel, professional high-end computing grew as well and that's where the money was. Academia followed the money.</p>

<p><strong>@Joel Jakubovic</strong>’s thesis should be interesting to folks here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Achieving Self-Sustainability in Interactive Graphical Programming Systems</em> 
Programming is fraught with accidental complexity. Software, including tools used for programming, is inflexible and hard to adapt to one's specific problem context. Programming tools do not support Notational Freedom, so programmers must waste cognitive effort expressing ideas in suboptimal notations. They must also work around problems caused by a reliance on plain text representations instead of Explicit Structure.</p>
<p>The idea of a Self-Sustainable programming system, open to adaptation by its users, promises a way out of these accidental complexities. However, the principles underlying such a property are poorly documented, as are methods for practically achieving it in harmony with Notational Freedom and Explicit Structure. We trace the causes of this difficulty and use them to inform our construction of a prototype self-sustainable system. By carefully reflecting on the steps involved in our specific case, we provide insight into how self-sustainability can be achieved in general, and thus how a motivated programmer can escape the aforementioned sources of accidental complexity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This new website gives access to 50+ years of work by Alexander and colleagues at CES. The goal of this continuing endeavor is to share the work with all who wish to build and repair living environments in which people thrive.
In total, the Archive includes some 29,000 items. About 50% of them have been catalogued to date and are listed on the website. Around 6000 items have been digitized and are now available from the website as downloads. As funding allows, we will work toward making the whole collection available.</p>

<li>visual pl for creating your own compiler</li>
<li>visual pl for spreadsheet creation and customization </li>
<li>visual pl for making domain specific languages </li>

<p>I will probably converge on a visual programming language with a spreadsheet GUI that compiles to WebAssembly. Any resources for intuition about compilers, spreadsheets, or DSLs that help me understand these topics would much appreciate.</p>

<p>I made a project to have lots of concepts explained in Gleam tours. Gleam runs in the browser and server so I think that this might be a good platform to explain a lot of things. I've been showing Gleam to non programmers and they mostly "get it" as long as there is no installation, editor setup, deployment to worry about. My current though for the future of code is that no-code might be less important that no-ops.</p>

<p>I finished implementing my first tutorial quicker than I expected. You can try it here. <a href="https://gleamtours.com/lustre-tutorial/introduction/welcome-to-lustre/">gleamtours.com/lustre-tutorial/introduction/welcome-to-lustre</a> It's a walk through creating a web app with Gleam and Lustre. The app is rendered in a separate window because future tours will allow you to implement a client and server and so the sandbox can't just be an element in the tours UI.</p>

<p>So this is going to be more of drive by random act of gratitude non-sequiturs smorgasbord, but I’m pretty sure y’all like overtone, and I will link, so that’s the bit right? So in all my scrubbing of recent podcast listenings and reading of show notes I forked (don’t you mean formed? No, no, there was the potential future timeline of consciousness, and this is the fork) a much deeper appreciation for the plethora of references so lovingly strewn throughout the show.</p>
<p>This was all to no avail in locating one wild goose of a phrase saying there was renewed effort on making overtone more useable so people can do cool shit. For a while I could swear it was Ivan’s voice I heard saying it. Well, it was actually the end of a different podcast. Perhaps the wires that got crossed were FoC and HoC. The important thing is that the supercollider of my mind has been thoroughly re-patched. And for that I thank you all! Also Clojure is cool. That’s my Ideology :) </p>

<p>Two related questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there any good research about using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_graph">call graphs</a> to create some metrics about the quality of a software architecture? (Since I've never looked into it — what's the state-of-the-art in measuring software quality, anyhow? I'm more interested in a quality architecture than bugs-per-line-of-code or something, I guess.)</li>
<li>Any favorite tool for visualizing call graphs for JavaScript or PHP? </li>
</ul>
<p>My intuition would tend to say that messy call graphs indicate a worse architecture, but I haven't visualized many and I'm not sure how well that idea holds up in the "real world". Maybe call graphs end up being too messy in real programs.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/VLf9slgin5Y">In this video</a>, I start with building a simple flow which counts the sum of all received values on the input ports using the new node-type "merge sum". New ports can be added dynamically from within the UI.</p>
<p>This is used to simplify the PID-controller example, which now much more reflects the algorithm that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional%E2%80%93integral%E2%80%93derivative_controller">shown on the wiki-page</a>.</p>
<p>I've also started integrating the monaco-editor (which is the base for vs.code) into code-flow-canvas.. and in the video you can see that it is used for editing the code behind the iframe-html-node.</p>
<p>Another small change, is that flows now start automatically when they are loaded or after a refresh.</p>

<p>I decided to make a pass at actually putting technical information on the <a href="http://calculang.dev">calculang.dev</a> frontpage.</p>
<p>My primary audience for <a href="http://calculang.dev">calculang.dev</a> is developers - due to the wide scope, I think this is important (and Steve Balmer, right?).</p>
<p>Other projects based on/around calculang will have a wider audience.</p>
<p>It's the first time I surface some information: about introspection output to help to make tools that interact with models, about a comparison to spreadsheets, a rough note about my visualization APIs. I'll expand on all these things in longer-form separately and add illustrations for some concepts (especially "flexibility"), but for now, I think it's important I have some things down that I can iterate on, and happy to hear any immediate feedback, especially about what lands especially poorly or doesn't fit! (since this is a community of developers, your feedback would be awesome for me to get to work)</p>
<p>I intend to push the Examples to a Gallery or Playground page instead, with just a more subtle carousal or such surfaced early in the main page</p>

<p>I officially promoted <a href="https://resheet.dev">ReSheet</a> from alpha to beta!</p>
<p>ReSheet has undergone a lot of detailed work over the last two months that might not be noticeable unless you encountered specific issues that got improved.</p>
<p>Noticable will be the improved starting document which makes it much clearer what ReSheet aims to achieve and how to use it. I added a demo, better documentation, and several examples. The examples aim to demonstrate what's possible with ReSheet and the potential I see in it. I think the "Examples &gt; Custom Blocks" and "Examples &gt; Interactive Game Dev" pages will be especially interesting to you.</p>
<p>"Examples &gt; Custom Blocks" illustrates how to integrate almost any other (web/React) library/tool. I think there’s a lot of potential if we could integrate the various tools developed here. Since many are web-based, ReSheet could potentially serve as a framework to unify them. If anyone is interested in exploring this, please send me a message! 🙂</p>
<p>"Examples &gt; Interactive Game Dev" showcases the possibilities for building custom Blocks in ReSheet. It uses built-in Blocks to create a simple interactive Game Editor, featuring live programming and displaying intermediate steps/results of the code.</p>

<p>Had fun presenting my<a href="https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/lazer-cut-shell-joints"> lazer cutting box joint generator Observable notebook</a> at Germany FoC meetup. Feel free to DM me or leave a comment in the notebook if you want to chat more about it. I dunno how well I communicated the point, but my point is that you can solve harder problems if you can link representations. There is no representational hierarchy of best-ness, I am finding switching between representations is useful for getting the best of all worlds. The notebook contains some cool advanced observable hacks, like projecting the inbuilt "plot" data visualizer onto three.js surfaces, linking quantitive DataViz to a Spatial representation, both of which have different strengths.</p>

<p>In something like prolog, terms can be nested. So I can express the idea "Socrates believes that he is mortal" with  <code>bel ieves(socrates, mortal(socrates)).</code>  Are there any popular database types that make it easy to have relations of arbitrary arity as parameters of other relations, without unduly adding to the complexity of the schema? Preferably with ungrounded statements and open-world negation? Is there some obvious reason why not? Is there a computational complexity problem that arises in the real world? RDF allows triples to be referenced, I believe, but you are limited to arity 2, which seems needlessly limiting. Labeled graphs have arbitrary arity for non-entities, but entities are limited to two, and you usually can't refer to an edge. It seems... weird to me. Is it just that we don't really have the efficient reasoners over those kinds of expressions, so it hasn't been useful?</p>

<p>Hello! So after much obsession with Propagator Networks as discussed on this slack <a href="https://history.futureofcoding.org/?fromDate=2024-03-18&amp;toDate=2024-03-24&amp;channel=thinking-together&amp;filter=#2024-03-21T19:26:33.915Z">💬 #thinking-together@2024-03-21</a>, i decided to make a little propagator network simulator on top of tldraw.</p>
<p>In short: Propagator networks enabling bi-directional computation via independently operating nodes- in the gif you can see one for converting temperatures. Propagators (squares) listen to changing inputs, run code, and update connected outputs.</p>
<p>You can make your own <a href="https://t.co/nxVo5UAShy">here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Put your variables in circles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put your JS in squares (you can write a return or not)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draw arrows from circles to squares with text that matches the variables</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draw arrows from squares to the circles to be updated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There's lot of awesome stuff than can be made with these (maybe everything?). If you want to have fun with it, try to make a conditional or a switch. Its fun 🙂</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>This is one of those questions where I don’t really know yet how to ask it, so let me fumble and handwave a little bit and see where this goes:</p>
<p>In computing history we went from printers to screens, and on those screens from a brief stint with vector graphics to bitmap displays, and on those bitmap displays from text mode to frame buffer, and in those frame buffers from sprites and blitting to rasterization and compositing. In the early days, when there wasn’t enough RAM for a full-screen bitmap frame buffer, character glyphs and sprites were brought in from ROM. Now we have so much memory that we have double-/triple-buffering and realtime compositing of separately stored textures that often exceed the number of screen pixels available by an order of magnitude or more.</p>
<p>I’m particularly interested in the early transition to raster graphics. At some point (and I assume that was probably with PostScript?) it became feasible to compute graphics on the fly instead of having them prepared as bitmaps in ROM or on disk. If I remember this correctly, PostScript was invented because due to the different font sizes it was more economical to ship instructions to generate glyphs on the fly on the printer than to ship all possible glyphs as bitmaps in all the different font sizes.</p>
<p>In a way we went from a “final” representation of a map of bits restricted to a certain grid size to an “intermediate” representation of instructions that have to be executed to generate the final map of bits in the desired size. Alternatively, we could see that as swapping space (memory) for time (compute).</p>
<p>Are you aware of any papers or other material that compares both sides of this transition?</p>
<p>For instance in terms of performance in space and time, ie. how much compute is needed for how much memory saved. Or in the broader sense of how we settled on certain graphics primitives, because they were cheap enough to implement in terms of compute, and how we settled on certain data formats, because they were small enough in terms of memory usage, so that this trade-off made sense.</p>

<p>It's not enough for a tool to solve your problem for you to use that tool. You have to also A) recognize the problem you have is solvable, B) recognize the tool can solve it, and C) be reasonably confident that you 
 <em>personally</em> can solve the problem with the tool. You need knowledge, skill, and the right mentality. Even programmers, who  <em>already have that mentality</em>, don't automatically generalize it to all applicable domains. Otherwise we'd be doing a lot more with our phones.</p>
<p>It's unreasonable to expect the average person will use any NoCode to solve their problems, regardless of how easy the tools are. This leaves the people for whom it provides economic value, which is why all modern NoCode tools are oriented towards business.</p>

<p>Hi friends! As part of my unending pursuit of creating The Best Programming Language, I've ended up building a structured editor / literate programming environment for creating self-hosted languages ... and that has turned into "An Interactive Tutorial about Compilers &amp; Type Inference", that includes interactive implementations of the papers "Algorithm W Step by Step" and "Typing Haskell in Haskell" (with more planned). I'm currently looking for beta testers to look it over before I make a general release, and I imagine there are many people here with relevant experience 😄.</p>
<p>So if any of y'all are interested, send me a message! As a teaser, here's the start of the intro document:</p>

<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1787851368528576829">this tweet</a> , Simon Wardley compares making software systems explainable via moldable development (my expansion of his reference to Glamorous Toolkit) to creating maps. That sounds like a very useful metaphor to me. Many of us are interested in or even working on visual coding tools, and I wonder what their take on this metaphor is. Maps are inherently visual, but they are not the territory, i.e. the code with all the details. To me, visual tools are obviously the right choice for creating maps, but I remain unconvinced about their appropriateness for code.</p>
<p>I am thinking in particular of <a href="https://twitter.com/OrionReedOne">Orion Reed</a>’s recent demo of infinite canvasses as user interfaces. For making multi-faceted maps to software systems, that looks like a very appopriate representation.</p>

<p>Loose set of thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>could you make a type system that somehow captures all information possible about every value in a codebase? Like where the following is true: if typeof(a) === number, then typeof(a + 1 + 2) === number+3 !== typeof(a) …</li>
<li>I might want to “pin” and “unpin” my types - e.g. before refactoring a function, to “pin” its return type. If I had a more powerful type system like described in part one, I wouldn’t want to have to write out the whole type, I would want to just say “pin this such that whatever changes I make could not possibly effect the outcome of the function for any input, or else give me errors describing exactly what part of the input space no longer maps logically the same to the output space”</li>
<li>Another way to think of this might be to say, rather than writing tests, to be able to say “assume infinite test coverage of this codebase (and all tests are passing), now let me refactor things”.</li>
<li>I have no idea how this would work, but it makes me think of getting fractions into “simplest form”. Maybe you could get two functions into “simplest form” to test their similarity?</li>
</ul>
<p>I wonder if anything like that exists, or if this is gesturing at some existing area of research?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What I’ve concluded, based on experience, is that positioning your project as an alternative implementation of something is a losing proposition. It doesn’t matter how smart you are. It doesn’t matter how hard you work. The problem is, when you build an alternative implementation, you’ve made yourself subject to the whims of the canonical implementation. They have control over the direction of the project, and all you can do is try to keep up.</p>

<p>There are some call-heavy agentic or personic processes that are going to get more feasible, like what Park did in "Human Simulacra." I'm hoping to use 4o or turbo to have a more structured step by step approach to code generation in domain specific visual languages.</p>

<p>What struck me when playing with it via the 'voice chat/conversation' thing, was a) how brilliant the voice recognition is, b) how brilliant the synthesised voice is, and c) how I was drawn into having a conversation with an AI.  I don't know if it's a use case, but what I can see happening is that more and more people are going to start treating the AI as a 'friend'.  I think that is quite sad, and will further isolate people from real life conversations, but I can also see how it will fill a need in some folks;  especially once the iPhone integration happens.</p>

<p>I've made some very nice UX improvements to the visual programming system that I am working on: it's now possible to replace a node with compatible node-types without hassle. When a node is selected, compatible node-types are shown in a dropdown. This helps especially when doing more creative work when creating a shader/gl flow for example and getting more feeling on what the impact is of certain mathematical operations (in the video <a href="https://youtu.be/K-956F6Vwps">youtu.be/K-956F6Vwps</a> I change a multiply node to an arctan calculation).</p>
<p>Another improvement is being able to insert a node into an existing connection.. also taking compatibility into account. This speeds up the creation process of flows in general.</p>
<p>Under the hood I've also made a nice improvement: I can now use jsx components using vanilla DOM without the use of react or other libraries. This is a nice DX improvement when developing my project.</p>

<p>Hello Future of Coding!</p>
<p>I'm looking for something which I would describe in the following way. There was a few years ago a article on hackernews where someone showed a kind of dynamic state transition visualization. One could setup multiple nodes and avalue flow from one node to the next but there would be also a flow back to the original node. So my question would be does anyone know what I refer to? What was the name of the diagram. I tried to search for dynamic state transition diagram but it is very scary how bad search engines are these days. So the Name of the diagram , the hackernews article or related reousces would be most welcome. Thank you 🙂</p>

<p>For the last month I've been working on an arrow toolkit for the web, called Quiver 🏹. It's exploring 3 problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if visual connection could be declaratively expressed in HTML? </li>
<li>What if there was a tiny toolkit that enabled all kinds of connection/arrows to be built? </li>
<li>How do we break arrows out from spatial canvases and enable them to used on any website?</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently I'm prototyping some pre-built arrows/connection: curved arrows, orthogonal edges, Xanadu links and hyperedges. But the library is also explicitly designed to be extensible so you can use your own layout algorithms or designs. Part of the extensibility means the ability to easily animate objects along the arrow (for all of those dataflow VPLs out there 😜) or add arbitrary labels/annotations to arrows.</p>
<p>Given that connection is probably one of the most commonly used relationships in visual programming systems, I'm curious if there are any other types of arrows or functionality you would find useful in your own projects? Its not published to NPM yet, but the repo is <a href="https://github.com/Little-Languages/quiver">here</a>.</p>

<p>I'm exploring strategies to enable scientists (biologists in pharma) without computational expertise be able to interact with big data more intuitively. My ultimate goal is to have users ask biological questions, and the system to generate and execute analytical workflows utilizing existing methods from the scientific domain to answer these questions with data visualizations,</p>
<p>I evaluated the non-interpretable and inaccurate "chat your data" LLM solutions. I'm currently thinking about the possibilities of developing/using a DSL as intermediary output prior to code generation to make the process more interpretable. I am also considering what would be the most efficient abstraction strategies of the analytical functionalities/libraries in certain biological domains to improve the accuracy of the outputs (of the higher level strategy and the actual code). I would love to brainstorm about these problems offline/online. Here's my <a href="posts/future-of-coding-weekly-202405-week-1/?fromDate=2024-04-29&amp;toDate=2024-05-05&amp;channel=introduce-yourself&amp;filter=#2024-05-02T03:05:57.913Z">💬 #introduce-yourself@2024-05-02</a> for a bit more context about me.</p>

<p>I am once again looking at pages of notes I wrote three years ago attempting to find a way to declaratively diagram concurrent legal processes so as to illuminate the steps available to the parties as the process unfolds. I feel like I have something worth exploring, but to illustrate it I need a diagramming language that allows me to nest nodes inside of one another, and draw edges that originate and terminate at arbitrary depths of nodes. DOT won't let you draw an arrow starting at the edge of a subgraph, and doesn't have any way of nesting actual nodes, for example. Is anyone aware of a text-based graphing language that will let me nest objects and draw edges between arbitrary depths?</p>

<p>I've been thinking about this tweet from John Carmack (who created Doom), and just generally about a future where AI does most of the coding and I'm managing AI - and... I hate it? It's not to say that I don't see this happening. There's a ton of capital flying around to make it happen, and I think end-users will inevitably gain the capability to build certain categories of simple, customised software.</p>
<p>But as someone who has deeply loved the practice of programming for more than a decade, the future that GitHub (who - in the midst of me writing this - launched Copilot Workspace), Devin, and the rest are painting seems to be leaving out so much of nuances that comes with building anything non-trivial. I absolutely love the idea of operating at a higher level of abstraction (just like how I enjoy writing modern programming languages compared to C or assembly) and getting my ideas/work out faster. But not spending my entire day just asking AI to do things or reviewing code all day - which makes me wonder: how do developers even get good at reviewing code if they aren't spending a ton of time writing code and problem solving? What's the right level of abstraction in this "promised future" that lets me get into the nuances of building software for anything non-trivial and continue problem solving in general? This is perhaps not even a question, and just a general thought I've been thinking a lot about.</p>

<p>I am looking around for tools / frameworks / UI patterns that are roughly of the shape "spreadsheet with editable computation pipeline". What do people know of that's in that category?</p>
<p>To clarify, I realise spreadsheets alone can achieve computation... but I am thinking more of projects where the computation is a bit more "visual" than just formulas in cells, perhaps like a nodes or blocks environment that then feeds into a table / spreadsheet to display data. <strong>@Paul Shen</strong>'s Natto is one such example of the kind of thing I am thinking of. There might be other ways to do this beyond just a series of nodes that feed into a table... I'm curious to see what else might be out there already. I wonder if there are projects in the data analysis / computational science spaces that might fit...?</p>
<p>Apologies if my question is too vague, I'm still trying to work out what I'm even looking for. 🙂</p>

<p>Orca is typically encountered as an inky black and seafoam green alphabet soup, pulsating to some species of broody electronic industrial throb. But it is also a forgiving learning environment that doesn’t crash, puts code and data together in the same space, lets you directly manipulate code and data interchangeably, allows generous recovery from mistakes, and supports discovery through freeform play.</p>
<p>This is one of those "a very special episode" sort of things where.. it's going to be a bit different from the episodes I make for the forseeable future. Hope you enjoy it!</p>

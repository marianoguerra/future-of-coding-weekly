<p>Just curious for all your thoughts, is being ahead of your time a good thing? I’m thinking of a conversation I had with <strong>@Toby Schachman</strong> in the Cuttle discord a while back where he mentioned that Cuttle aimed certain details at a status-quo of programming style unlike it’s predecessor Apparatus, I thought that was quite profound. I’m thinking also of Fortran vs Lisp (or perhaps Forth). When is it  <em>not</em>  worth it to meet people where they are?</p>

<p>I wanted to bounce 2 terms I've been thinking of off of this group:</p>
<p>I dig visual programming, but think the term is like a little bit of a brain poison because it isn't really descriptive of the goals, and, like, almost all textual programming is inherently visual, too...just...in the way text is.</p>
<p>I think <a href="http://ivanish.ca/">Ivan Reese</a> was the person I first heard float the term "spatial programming," which I dig, but at least for me, it also misses the real value add of what I'm looking for in a "visual" system.</p>
<p>So, the two terms I've been kicking around:</p>
<ul>
<li>relational programming</li>
<li>cartographic programming</li>
</ul>
<p>Neither are perfect, and both feel exhaustingly pretentious (a good thing, may haps?) but my intention with both terms is to highlight that these sorts of systems, unlike text-based programming, help make the relationships between different elements (classes, data flow, inheritance, etc.) meaningful using information other than similar names.</p>
<p>Useful? Stupid? Prior art?</p>

Section 3.4 (Granularity and Interactivity) will be especially interesting; the authors avoid flattening this idea to a 'file system'.</p>

<p>I see lots of folks here are interested in the intersection of programming and AI (to say little); I finally posted an example combining Unit and LLMs on X. It is a reactive graph for text reasoning and image generation. I start from a statement, then apply commands to transform it, ultimately rendering generated images. <a href="https://twitter.com/io_sammt/status/1748683055605195087?s=46&amp;t=kvyalr_gJlbdW-jQJstTcg">Take a look </a>.

<p>When working on my language I've been frustrated by the lack of symbols and extra information for my JIT compiled code. There is a way to get this kind of information, but it involves building an elf binary in memory. Way too much overhead for this point in my development.</p>
<p>So I started building my own debugger frontend to lldb. Not much to show right now. But the idea is to specifically tailor it to my language. So you'll get a compiler explorer like experience, but also be able to view the stack and heap and all of that live. See the language level values stored in there.</p>
<p>The fun part to for me was how to convey the information I need to the debugger. The answer came from the standard JIT interface. How do you tell your debugger things? You make a function that the debugger has a breakpoint in. The function does nothing in the body. You just pass some args that tells the debugger where in memory to get the information it needs. Super clever. So now I'm working on passing all my compiler metadata to the debugger frontend so it can know how to render things intelligently.</p>

<p><img alt="Youtube Thumbnail" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/ApOfXliyGqc/hqdefault.jpg"></p>
<p>This week I spend a lot of time adding basic keyboaed support in the visual programming system that I am developing. For productivity I think that just using a mouse for creating a visual flow is not enough. One of the reasons why we are so productive when using a text editor for programming is the usage of the keyboard I think. Off course it's not the only reason but I do think it's of major influence. </p>
<p>So being able to use the keyboard for visual programming seems like a very good idea. In <a href="https://youtu.be/ApOfXliyGqc">this video</a> I show exactly that.</p>
<p>Currently after every update to the flow, the tabindex is set on all the nodes and input elements. In normal webapps this is not a good idea, but here it is the only way to give the browser the proper and logical tab order. When tabbing through the flow, the camera is focused on the selected node overriding default browser scroll-behavior when a focused element is out of the current view. Using ctrl+a you can add a new node and also select the thumbs for the connection.  </p>
<p>Furthermore I've added some other features like being able to run a flow using the keyboard (ctrl + Enter) and opening the properties popup. A missing feature is being able to add a new node before the currently selected node.</p>
<p>Lots of small tweaks were needed to make this work, but I am glad I spend the time because this also increases the accessibility.</p>

<p><a href="http://ivanish.ca/">Ivan Reese</a>, in episode 9 of a podcast I can’t tell if I’m supposed to know about or not, you asked, “Where is [data] going when you’re throwing it away, and when you rewind, how does it come back?” And I don’t think it has answers that you’d want to apply directly to your situation, but  ~<em><em>Feynman’s Lectures on Computing</em></em>~  comes back to the idea of reversible computing again and again with various playful metaphorical lenses. I think that at the very least it might be a nice way to take a break and think about the problem from a physicist’s perspective now and then, if this is still a problem you’re working on.</p>

<p>I’ve been really into probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) lately. I had a few “aha” moments and I’m decidedly in the “hit everything with this hammer to figure out where the nails are” phase.</p>
<p>Anyway, is anybody here in a similar headspace? Or already experienced with PPLs?</p>
<p>Is anybody curious to enter this headspace with me? I reviewed the (online, free, programmable) book that brought me here: <a href="https://micro.alltom.com/2024/01/11/the-cognition-in.html">micro.alltom.com/2024/01/11/the-cognition-in.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The “Cognition” in Probabilistic Models of Cognition 📚 is the hardest part to get across when I recommend this book. Because the book isn’t “Bayes works, yawn.” It’s so much more interesting if you, like me, exist primarily in ML circles that focus on curve-fitting:
 What could be going on in our heads when we can’t tell that the two grid squares in that optical illusion are the same color?</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/glFRPjWWlzA">In this video</a>  I show a timeline slider with which you can scroll through the executed path of a visual flow program. Some node-types like variables and the node-tree-visualizer have there state being recorded for each execution.. so when moving through the timeline, these nodes are updated and especially with the node-tree-visualizer this gives a good overview of how a program/algorithm works (in this case quicksort). Instead of having to visualize this in your head , you see the effect of the program for each execution step and you can also inspect the variables like the left and right arrays and the pivot variable.</p>
<p>On the end of this month I hope to release a demo version of the project I am working on, so the last weeks I've also been fixing bugs and making other improvements. One of the bigger improvements is the way the moving message bubble is handled, it's now much smoother especially on lower execution speeds because of the use of requestAnimationFrame, it was on my wishlist from the beginning I implemented this but hadn't come around to it yet. </p>

<p>I really like the premise of this paper and the first few sections of this paper, framing hypermedia as an underlying medium in software.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hypermedia was introduced not as a subgenre of software, but as a different conceptualization of what software is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not too excited by their implemented solution though (Webstrates). Still, the premise can be taken in many other directions I imagine.</p>

<p>Not sure whether this is  <em>quite</em>  on topic for FoC, but I made a toy and I'm pleased with it.</p>
<p>I was inspired by <a href="http://www.inference.org.uk/dasher/">Dasher</a>, which uses the low entropy of natural language to make it possible to enter text using only a 1-dimensional input device. The core idea is to make the most likely next input take up a lot of space and thus make it easy to reach.</p>
<p>Most interactions we have with a computer involve low entropy input.</p>
<p>With (1) good models, and (2) a lossy encoding/decoding model that is easy for humans to use, you should be able to get away with entering a lot less.</p>
<p>For code, LLMs are pretty powerful models. And fuzzy matching is a pretty easy-to-use lossy encoding model.</p>

<h2>Our Work</h2>
<p>💬 <strong>Robin Allison</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://history.futureofcoding.org/history/weekly/2024/01/W2/share-your-work.html#2024-01-04T06:22:58.649Z">🧵 conversation</a></p>
<p>I really like TodePond's video "Screens in Screens in Screens". I've been wanting to do the same kinda thing with mathematical formulas instead of shapes, a kind of "formulas in formulas in formulas", but I'm an awful programmer so I'll describe some math you can do to that effect. Apologies in advance for the shoddy explanation though.</p>
<p>Here's a thing you can do with "screens". You can name screens. Start with some screens A B C. Then if C is inside A, and A and B are the same color, then there is a copy of C inside B. What do you call this copy? "The copy of B from A to C"? It will be convenient if we give it a symbolic name. Call it (A-&gt;B)C. Or if you are really hardcore you can call it just t(A,B,C) where t is a ternary operator describing the result of copying C from A to B. You may think to only consider (A-&gt;B)C when C is inside A, but the math becomes tractable if you consider all screens at once. Then we can stipulate some axioms:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>(A-&gt;A)B = B</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(A-&gt;B)A=B</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(B-&gt;C)(A-&gt;B)=(A-&gt;C)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(A-&gt;(X-&gt;Y)A)=(X-&gt;Y)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first axiom means if you are copying a screen from one screen to itself, you aren't changing anything. The second axiom is "obvious" except for considering (A-&gt;B)A in the first place. The third axiom means if you copy a screen from A to B and then from B to C that is the same as if you were to copy it from A to C directly. It is also shorthand for (B-&gt;C)((A-&gt;B)D) = (A-&gt;C)D for all screens D. The fourth axiom takes a bit more explaining. Basically we want this equation to be true whenever A is in X, and both sides are being used to copy something from A. But our theory at this point doesn't have a predicate for "A is contained in X" so we say it holds in all cases.</p>
<p>With these axioms you can show the operators (A-&gt;B) form an algebraic structure called a group: You can multiply them by performing one copy after the other (C-&gt;D)(A-&gt;B). This operation is associative (I mean, it must be), and has an identity element and inverses. The identity being (A-&gt;A) and the inverse of (A-&gt;B) being (B-&gt;A).</p>
<p>Another perspective is to view screens as points in an affine space (i.e. vector space without a specified origin). Then (A-&gt;B)C can be thought of as (B-A)+C, and each of the axioms above can be interpreted as vector equations. This isn't a good model though because it ends up saying some screens are the same when they should be different. You can still take the above axioms and show that screens form a generalization of affine spaces called torsors.</p>
<p>I'll share more if anybody is interested. It really needs a much longer write up, but I thought somebody might know if its already been done before.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I started a new series of blog posts (or “newsletters”, in Substack parlance) about  <em>simplicity</em> :</p>
<p>1 • <a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/on-simplicity">On simplicity</a> introduces the series with how my thinking about simplicity has changed over the years.</p>
<p>2 • <a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/on-simplicity-2-meaning-ful-design">Meaning-ful design</a> connects simplicity to meaning making and coherence.</p>
<p>3 • <a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/on-simplicity-3-familiarity">Familiarity</a> explores how complex things can be surprisingly simple and why we can’t ignore context.</p>
<p>4 • <a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/on-simplicity-4-reciprocal-realization">Reciprocal realization</a> frames design as a complex dynamic process of mutual adaptation between designer and designed object.</p>
<p>…  <em>I expect about four or five more posts coming after that, but I haven’t written them yet, so I have no idea.</em> 🙂</p>
<p>A lot of this draws on 4E cognitive science, design theory, and philosophy. As such it may perhaps be less technical than you would expect it to be, although I try much harder in this series to relate it more directly to programming and software development than in <a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/previously-a-recap">my last</a>.</p>
<p>And that’s why I post it here, today. I’m hoping to learn if this resonates at all with a technical audience, or if this is still too abstract. I know we’re all craving for the easily applicable  <em>Top 10 Things to Make Things Simple</em>  (and number 6 will surprise you), but I have reason to believe that it’s just not that… well… simple. But I think I’m slowly making progress towards synthesizing something valuable, even if I can’t express it as beautifully as I would like to. Yet.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think, and please ask any questions you may have (in thread or via DM). Appreciate your feedback!</p>

<p>Spinners are boring, so might as well get creative with AI UX for loading states, even with fast LLMs like Mixtral.</p>
<p>The thinking is to not only show multiplayer presence on our canvas, but also what the AI is doing and working on, including visualizing the code its writing in real-time.</p>

<p>I think I have a usable app development experience now on my tablet. I basically took my recent Lua Carousel and made a few changes. In Carousel (first clip) you start in the programming environment, each screen runs a separate script, scripts run in the background of the editor, and each screen manages its own canvas. The new setup (second clip) starts in the app, which takes over the entire device until I 'exit' into the programming environment. In the programming environment, screens are now just editors with a shared 'run' button and canvas. Hopefully I can now finish polishing this  ~turd~  app entirely on the tablet.</p>

<p>💡  Communicating programming ideas by <a href="http://ivanish.ca/">Ivan Reese</a></p>

<p>Someone reached out to ask me for more thoughts about communicating programming ideas through media other than the academic paper. I wrote a reply, and then decided it would be worth sharing here to see if other folks have their own inspirations they'd like to share, or ideas for how our industry can go  <em>paper-free</em>  ;)</p>
<hr>
<p>I feel like I owe reading an apology. I certainly try to play up my "crank" side on the podcast, but it does run the risk of mixing-up  <em>this is being silly</em> with  <em>this is thoughtful critique</em> .</p>
<p>I have tremendous reverence for the communicative potential of the written word. I just think there are some kinds of ideas that lend themselves better to other forms of expression, or some ideas that can't be written down.</p>
<p>For instance, it's very strange to me whenever I read a paper about HCI, especially if they're discussing GUI ideas. Sure, often these papers will be accompanied by a video. But, like, the work being described is about  <em>interacting with interfaces</em> . I think the work should be presented as an interface you can interact with!</p>
<p>I'm especially fond of <a href="http://worrydream.com">Bret</a>'s essays, naturally. <a href="https://ciechanow.ski">Bartosz</a> also does great work with visualization, though I feel like he leans a little too heavily on text and that the visualizations are too linear. <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com">Amit</a> also does excellent work, but he has the advantage that most of the things he demos are inherently about interactive graphics so they lend themselves naturally to this sort of presentation (not to diminish the incredible effort Amit puts in to these articles).</p>
<p>The thing I want to see more of is… people finding ideas that can  <em>only</em>  be expressed through interaction. I think successfully achieving this requires that someone work natively in interaction, a lot, for a long time. As a result, most of these ideas seem to emerge in the periphery of video games.</p>
<p>One of my favourite examples is <a href="https://w.itch.io/dys4ia">Dys4ia</a>, a collection of microgames about the trans experience. It uses written language and (meaningfully crude) visual art to set up the  <em>plot</em> , but interaction to tell the  <em>story</em> .</p>
<p>Something I'm very interested in seeing (and have made a few attempts at myself, but nothing worth sharing) is an attempt to create a fully-usable programming environment  <em>presented as a game</em>  specifically for the purpose of communicating ideas about programming. There've been plenty of the inverse, where a programming system is the setting within which a game takes place (see all the works of <a href="http://zachtronics.com">Zachtronics</a>, for instance), but I haven't seen anyone do a game as the setting within which actual programming takes place. Closest to that might be something like Minecraft or Dreams (etc), but I don't think those were designed to communicate ideas about programming the way, say, The Witness was designed to communicate a philosophy of science.</p>
<p>Another close comparison might be Advent of Code, where you playfully approach programming differently than in your normal work. The programming you do for AoC should feel meaningfully different. Similarly, imagine building your own Rosetta Code from scratch. That should give you a really particular feeling. I think it's related to, say, the feeling of writing a rasterizer for the dozenth time. I think these feelings are ideas, and that there's a whole language of them, and that the language is expressed through the creation of systems. I think if we studied this language, it would guide us toward building different kinds of tools.</p>
<p>And hell, you might eventually be able to write a paper about that. (Countdown to someone arguing that this is what Christopher Alexander has made a career of, in a sense.) But I don't think we will arrive at those system-feeling ideas in any way other than by building and playing with systems, and with a particular intention at that.</p>

<p>Heya internetpeoples ❤ I’ve spent a long time refining this and brought in “The LLMs” to help craft the tone here, and I think I’ve finally gotten it to a point where I feel like it hits my message and question, and doesn’t assume too much negativity or… doomcalling, heh. Thanks for the time and shared space, as always.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’ve despaired when stuck on problems I just couldn’t crack. I’ve also felt the joy of those “aha!” moments when things finally click. We’ve all been there as coders. While documentation and searches can help fill gaps, little replaces another human sitting alongside, guiding with patience earned from experience. In those moments when someone more seasoned gave guidance, I felt hope renewed. How might we foster more of these vital human connections?</p>

<p><em>Knowledge flows when passion meets patience</em> . I’m grateful for the patient coders who “reached down” to guide me. Let’s discuss barriers hampering these relationships. Generalizations about certain groups being “unwilling” to help are counterproductive. However, empathetic mentorship remains scarce. How might we change incentives?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Truly supporting newcomers requires understanding their frustrations are valid. I want to open a thoughtful discussion on constructive ways we can keep improving in this regard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are always exceptions by those dedicated to lifting others up. But much room remains for improving access, channels and incentives for more direct peer sharing across experience levels. It’s on each of us to reflect on where we can have an impact.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I welcome reactions, shared experiences, and dialogue toward that aim. How might we strengthen coder communities through human connections? Where do you see the biggest opportunities? Together, I believe we can guide positive change.</p>

<p>I ran across <a href="https://cassette-lang.com/">Cassette</a>, a programming language today. I liked some of the stuff on the webpage and think it is interestingly aligned with the Future of Coding community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I made Cassette as a simple language for “playful programming”. Playful programming is writing something for the sake of writing it. It’s making a software 3D renderer or a GIF reader, even though better implementations of those already exist. It’s making generative art programs and drawing them with a pen plotter. Cassette itself is playful programming—there are certainly other scripting languages that may be better for personal projects like these, but this one is mine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Continuing,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In particular, I wanted Cassette to feel “essential”, where each aspect of the language reflects some fundamental aspect of computing</em> 
 (from a functional language perspective, at least). For example, I consider garbage collection, lexical scopes, and immutable types essential. The result is a little boring, but I hope it’s a good platform to play with other programming concepts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Theory creation, world-building, and crafting software are all one in the same activity. Removing any of these elements eliminates the very value you hired software engineers to provide. But it does more than that. It forces these software engineers to make a difficult choice: fight to create the world they believe in, or give up and live in a world they are no longer invested in.</p>

<p>In the spirit of clearly communicating what you're signing up for, this podcast episode is nearly three hours long, and among other things it contains a discussion of a paper by author Mary Shaw titled <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3480947">Myths &amp; Mythconceptions</a> which takes as an organizing principle a collection of myths that are widely believed by programmers, largely unacknowledged, which shape our views on the nature of programming  <em>as an activity</em>  and the needs of programmers  <em>as people</em>  and the sort of work that we do  <em>as a sort of work</em> , and where by acknowledging these myths the three of us (Mary Shaw primarily, and by extension Jimmy and I, those three people, that's it, no other people appear on this podcast) are able to more vividly grip the image of programming with our mind's eye (or <a href="https://aphantasia.com">somesuch</a>) and conceive of a different formulation for programming, and in addition to these myths this paper also incudes a number of excellent lists that I take great pleasure in reading, beyond which I should also note that the paper does a job of explaining itself and that hopefully you'll find I've done a similar job, that's the spirit, please enjoy.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/YtDvPAfJ8jE">this video</a> I show an implementation of the quicksort algorithm using my visual programming system and not only that, but also the different steps of the output of the algorithm are visualized using a node tree. </p>
<p>One thing I noticed when making these kinds of algorithm flows, that they tend to grow horizontally quickly. So, to help prevent that, I've introduced the concept of "decorators" (they are in the "stacked" nodes). Decorators can be added before or after node-types that support this. </p>
<p>Now at least flows can also grow vertically a bit more. In the future I also want to be able to combine multiple nodes in a component or grouped node. </p>
<p>There are currently only 2 decorator types: expressions and sending data to the node-tree. Editing is not yet possible via the editor itself but only directly in the underlying json data of a flow. Also I needed to improve the way scoped variables work with regard to recursive functions, the same for the "merge"-node-type. Each node receives a scopeId depending on the scope within it is executed (every call to a function creates a new scope, this scopeId is passed to the function-node which passes it through to its connected nodes and so on).</p>

<p>Thought about a new architecture for my tool that would make it play better with LLMs, so as to get more help with generating code. Built an MVP version of it over the last week, or so, with just text-based code, and it works well enough that I'm going to have to re-implement my visual language in the new architecture.</p>

<p>Hey everyone! 👋 I’m a student who’s been working on a side project to explore how LLMs may augment creative problem solving.</p>
<p>I’ve synthesised everything into a rough concept I would love to hear your perspectives on:</p>
<p>~<em><em>Here is a quick demo:</em></em>~  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDRg5WgSrm0"> A tool to augment creative problem-solving. </a></p>
<p>Initial inspirations include Jef Raskin’s “Archy”, Mozilla’s old “Ubiquity” project, the thinking of Vannevar Bush, and recent tools like “mymind”. There are still many ideas and user experience concerns to be properly fleshed out, but hopefully it’s an interesting direction.</p>

"Hi, I'm Lua Carousel, could I please have access to your mic?" Ick! It seems like a bad idea to ask for a permission for the whole app just in case some single script uses it. Probably affects the conversions from this particular blog post, but I don't want to feel like I'm contributing to the general fatigue over apps asking for permissions. 🤷</p>

<p>aside: The whole issue of passwords and permissions is a  <em>huge</em>  UX issue that deserves a long discussion on of-end-user-programming.  Users should be allowed to  <em>just use</em>  a device without being forced to answer a bunch of questions about technical issues and needing to keep a bowl full of anti-anxiety meds nearby.  Imagine if my refrigerator required me to perform some ritual before allowing me to put my recently-bought lettuce into the crisper.</p>

<p>I've been enjoying the "<a href="https://www.tadiweb.com">tadi web</a>" approach Lu has been espousing lately. I also had some nice discussions at Strange Loop with Devine and a few others about minimizing friction / dependencies / build steps, both broadly but also specifically pertaining to publishing one's personal site. So in this spirit, I've been reworking my personal site a bit. I plan to finally add RSS and, even though it goes against the spirit of Lu and Devine's approaches, add a more complex build process that enables some functionality I've long wanted.</p>

<li>A brand new and extremely amateurish Metal rendering “engine” focused primarily on character glyphs.</li>
<li>An, “is this a joke?” UTF8-&gt;UTF32-&gt;UnicodeGraphemeCluster GPU based text parser and basic layout engine.</li>
<li>Download GitHub repositories in-app and view arbitrary textual files.</li>
<li>Reset your atlas if you stumble into new languages online 🤓</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve got an iPhone, iPad, or Mac device, I’d be happy to invite ya to the TestFlight to give the app a whirl where you’d like. Desktop builds and releases coming upon next coffee intake ritual.</p>

<p>I heard that day-5 part two was a curveball, so I really want to be able to implement it using my visual programming system... which failed so far. Using a brute force solution would mean that the program would run very very long. And my current "speed run" solution wouldn't suffice for this. </p>
<p>Part one actually provided a big challenge for my vps as well, running the program with the small test dataset can be seen in the video: <a href="https://youtu.be/td0QeePvfGQ">youtu.be/td0QeePvfGQ</a> . I've spend a lot of time adding more new node-types this weekend (like handling a while-loop and improved array handling) and making changes to the variable-nodes and expressions. Also the variable scoping (needed for local function variables) that I implemented had some flaws, so I fixed that as well. You can now define global and scoped variables. I've also made some simple variable visualizers that better show the data for data types like dictionary/array and grid. </p>
<p>My current vps solution works better than the flow-based vps that I was building last year. A big difference is that the data that is send from node to node is now just a single value. That value can still be of different types (number, string, array).. and special variable-nodes are needed to keep track of data. These variables also have a type like number, string, array, dictionary, grid. Often working with a single value is not enough and that's why these variables are needed. They can be referenced from within expressions. Also being able to run some flow-parts in parallel or sequentially helps a lot. This starts to feel much more like a regular 3rd gen programming language. </p>
<p>The UI is currently quite limited.. to be able to create a flow program efficiently it definitely needs a lot of work. Textual programming is much faster. I want to finish at least one of the advent of code puzzles where a grid is involved .. so today's puzzle (17) seems like a good fit. I'll probably work on that next weekend.</p>

<p>One nice reusable abstraction my LÖVE apps have all converged on is an immediate-mode button primitive. I draw all my buttons each frame along with all the callbacks they need, and a couple of framework-y lines of code in the mouse-press callback is all it takes to get them working. Last night I realized (while poking inside <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=236661&amp;sid=2693d6bb97fdec2945964df8ab60a34a#p236661">Re: Conway's game of life</a>) that my hacky sliders in Lua Carousel's settings admit a similar abstraction (even better than the one there). The only additional complexity is it needs a couple more lines in the  <code>update</code>  callback that continually refresh the backing value as you drag the slider.</p>

<p>Finally starting to see a workflow come together in my editor. Here you can see Fibonacci at three different levels in the language I'm making. These functions live in three different files. Looking at them at once and comparing them isn't easily supported in any other editor I use. On the left is a simplistic symbol browser.</p>
<p>I'm super excited that I'm slowly getting to the point where I can do these kinds of things. Having different views of our codebases that we can switch between is something I've been wanting for years.</p>

<p>I'm making a system for working with loosely structured tables in spreadsheets. Tables/lists in sheets represent collections of things, however formulas and drag-filling works at an item-level (cell-level) abstraction. This causes a lot of problems – duplicated effort, hard to do lookups across tables, errors when new data is added. However, committing to a structure upfront (a SQL style table for example) has a big cost. An effective system would allow users to gradually introduce structure that works with whatever rich table they draw.</p>
<p>Right now I'm onto a language for pulling data from such rich tables. It works by manipulation of the ranges (rectangles) pointed to by Labels. Queries can be made by intersecting/unioning rectangles (in picture is a small example). What ideas/projects would you recommend looking at in this space? I've looked around a fair bit for "2D grammar" and "spatial programming language" but haven't had much luck.</p>

<p>Today, is there a way to build state-driven UI components (like React/Vue/Svelte) where some of the state, but not all, can be persisted periodically in the backend perhaps as an event log which would enable things like playback of past interactions? How would you go about creating something like this with usual tools like Javascript, REST and Postgresql? 🤔</p>

<p>Status video about Kinopio2md (Kinopio to Markdown). What is not said is that the blue boxes are source code for the app (the compiler compiles the drawings to executable code).  I deal with a bunch of different programming languages, picking the best one for each step along the way (approximately 10, if you include English). I want to document more deeply the use of the Transpiler in, say, the “Escape Whitespace” Component (and others), but, I haven’t gotten around to it yet</p>

<p>Oh boy.. it was a lot of work being able to solve advent of code puzzle 7 (part 1) in my visual programming system.. as you can see in the video <a href="https://youtu.be/kkgJQdJXFtk">youtu.be/kkgJQdJXFtk</a>. I had to implement a lot new node-types for handling dictionaries and a new scoped-variable type. This scoped-variable can have different types.. currently just a regular value or a dictionary. This dictionary is used in a function-flow to determine the hand type which is needed in this puzzle. Also custom sorting was needed (I implemented a Schwartzian transform in the sort node-type). Running the flow for the full puzzle input takes a long time so I don't show that in the video (although I've added a "full-speed" mode that helps a bit). I've also added some colors to better show when some nodes are active, especially handy for nodes that run longer like a foreach, function-call, map or sort.</p>

<p>What if web frameworks offered a standard way to discover capabilities that are then given to AI as tools? A  <code>document.getTools()</code>  perhaps?</p>
<p>This could be achieved simply with plugins for NextJS, VueJS, SvelteKit etc. Small convention that eliminates a lot of brittleness when web agents try to discover capabilities and invoke them.</p>

<p>Hi all, I've been inactive here for a long time. Progress on my big project, a collaborative mobile-friendly development environment, has been very slow. However, along the way I've built some libraries which may be of interest to some people here.</p>
<p>On the languages and parsing side, I've built <a href="https://github.com/jhp/recursive-grammar-literal">recursive grammar literals</a> which lets you write CFGs as normal javascript functions. And <a href="https://github.com/jhp/church-cat">church-cat</a> which lets you compute over a tree structure, e.g. annotate a parse tree.</p>
<p>On the UI side I've built <a href="https://github.com/jhp/imperative">imperative</a> which is a frontend javascript library much like React, but based on generators and structured concurrency. And most recently I've been working on <a href="https://github.com/jhp/palimpsest">Palimpsest</a> which covers the backend of web development with a more functional or "event-sourced" style where data sources are computed as folds over input streams. My interest there is to allow stateful applications to be more easily shared, forked, and extended by their users etc.</p>

<p>We just published a new demo of Plato's PBD subsystem. Much more powerful than our previous implementation.</p>
<p>PBD is historically difficult to generalize and make practical, but it seems that once you take it out of the desktop metaphor and apply it to relational data where queries are more explicit, it does quite well.</p>
<p>I suspect this could become the most prevalent way of automating app logic without coding.</p>

<p>Hi All</p>
<p>I’m almost “done” with my VR visual/spatial programming app, Pebble Graphics 🎉 (“done” because I still see a lot of things that could be improved, but there are other projects I’m excited to start so I’m shipping what I have). It’s a VR version of turtle graphics with some interactive program stepping and 3D visualizations of things like state change and execution history.</p>
<p>I made a trailer you can watch (and listen to 🎶) here <a href="https://youtu.be/Fl3DjzTdUo8?si=bWi7CWwbXIQh_wUw">Pebble Graphics Trailer</a>. If you have a Quest headset and want to try it out, I set up a Beta release while I try to get it into Meta’s App Lab app store. This link <a href="https://www.meta.com/s/2Rlda8ess">meta.com/s/2Rlda8ess</a> should work otherwise feel free to DM me the email address associated with your Oculus/Meta account.</p>

<p>I’m more of a lurker in this slack, but it’s a community I enjoy checking on and it’s really cool to see it grow!</p>

<p>Pebble Graphics is a 3D visual and interactive programming system that lets you create and explore geometric patterns in virtual reality. Using simple commands, you can control Pebbles the dog to draw lines and shapes with programming. You can also step through your programs interactively, and see unique 3D visualizations of how things change over time. Pebble Graphics is a fun and creative way to learn basic ideas in programming.</p>

<p>Last year I used the advent of code to test the visual programming environment that I was building at that time.. and it helped me to come to the conclusion to start over.. which I did at the beginning of this year. So... the time has come to test my new environment and let advent of code help me improve and extend it. Hopefully this year I won't need to decide to start over😅. To finish the first challenge I needed to extend my vps with new node types or tweak some other stuff like be able to execute regex expressions and load external files as input to a flow. For the second part of day 1 a special node needed to be created to handle the sneaky replace string functionality that was needed. A very nice update that I made is the possibility to run parts of flow in parallel instead of sequential and use the results in the upstream nodes. </p>
<p>And talking about upstream nodes... since last week it's also possible to drag all upstream or downstream nodes at once when reorganizing a flow using UI elements(it can be seen in the video). </p>
<p>In the flow-engine I also use standalone nodes that represent global variables which can be used in other nodes. </p>
<p>I'll definitely not make it to the AoC leaderboard (it's not a goal anyway).. however.. I think I am getting a lot of value out of this already..even on day 1.</p>

<p>Been making slow, but steady progress on my editor. I can properly zoom in and out on the canvas. I can have some panes that represent sub-file things. The power usage when idle is basically non-existent (down from 100% cpu usage always). I finally feel like things are starting to come together and that I can finish up some parts and then really start focusing on actually making the flow and features fit how I code.</p>
<p>Hopefully soon I can start using it for a project that isn't coding itself so I am forced to add all the features I've been ignoring.</p>

<p>I've demoed my Kopi language and Rect-Desktop projects a few weeks ago. In my experience writing Kopi, I've always wanted to write a "How to Write a Programming Language" tutorial based on it, since the core language is simple and familiar (infix operators, assignment, anonymous functions, etc.).

<p>Followup on my  <code>~_*Colorful types*_~</code>  project. I’m trying to create a  <code>~_*map*_~</code>  for a codebase with different zoom levels.</p>
<p>I have been thinking about having 3 zoom levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1: Only colors for both types &amp; functions</li>
<li>Level 2: Colors and names for types, functions and parameters</li>
<li>Level 3: Shows the entire source file (maybe with some extra color sugar on top?) </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a couple of screenshots of level 1 &amp; 2, and video of the WIP interface.</p>
<p>PS. Anyone have good recommendations of typescript codebases with a couple dozen source code files which I can use for testing?</p>

<p>More progress on a lightweight programming environment that runs on Linux, Windows, Mac, Android, iOS. Also modifiable live while it runs (though not on mobile devices).</p>
<p>The seed design constraint here was to structurally prevent the pop-up keyboard on a touchscreen from ever blocking my typing. That led to this design of a multi-line commandline editor in the top half, fixing the non-editable output buffer in the bottom half. Independent commands/scripts then expanded in the only other direction available: left/right.</p>

<p>Hi, in this weeks video I show a new node type in which a prompt can be entered which is used to create HTML via openai gpt4. It's quite powerful .. the created nodes can receive and visualize input data from another node. This is offcourse inspired by makeitreal from tldraw which uses gpt4-vision-preview. I have been playing with the prompt to get the result that I wanted, although the results are not consistent when recreating the html using the same prompt. Still, very cool that this is possible.</p>

<p>Achievement unlocked: I've built an app large enough[1] that it crashes my programming environment that puts all the code on a spatial surface.</p>
<p>The problem: I do this snazzy initial animation (see video) that takes in the whole thing before zooming back in somewhere. That animation works by drawing the whole surface to an in-memory canvas before transforming it. Turns out drawing to a canvas still uses the video card, and I don't have enough video RAM for a virtual "monitor" of this resolution.</p>
<p>[1] Or spread out enough. It's not really about lines of code, just how much area the code occupies.</p>

<p>I was leafing through my father's old books when this diagram caught me off-guard.</p>
<p>We're so used now to having an OS with apps, that it's weird to think of OS-level transitions (login-&gt;shell), inter-apps transitions (shell-&gt;vi) and inside-app transitions (vi's command&lt;-&gt;append modes) as similar things. 🙃</p>
<p>But to a user new to computers, yes these are all "modes".</p>

<p>I think that often the most difficult part of programming is debugging: humans aren't very good at "seeing" how an app operated when it failed. You get some log output that might or might not have references to the correct file locations.</p>
<p>I don't see any reason, in the long term, why humans would be better than machines at debugging. How to make that happen? I assume somebody is building this already. Would it help if an AI with a large context window + access to the VM could see the whole call logs/tree and see exactly what is going on?  AI could learn from other users, see everything that happens in a run without debugger/console.logs, try multiple solutions in parallel, and fix issues while you sleep.</p>
<p>Thoughts on this?</p>

<p>Ink &amp; Switch just released a new essay: <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/embark/">Embark — Dynamic documents for making plans</a>.</p>
<p>Starting from a desire to "unbundle the app" in the name of malleable software, they explore using a bullet-point outliner as a substrate for dynamic properties, computations, and views. They ground the work with a specific use case — trip planning — and they hard-code a bunch of stuff that ought to be pushed into user space, granted. But it's easy to look at this, imagine how it could be expanded, and see some really compelling possibilities for a different way to approach creating and distributing software.</p>

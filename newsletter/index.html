<p>For the last month I've been working on an arrow toolkit for the web, called Quiver 🏹. It's exploring 3 problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if visual connection could be declaratively expressed in HTML? </li>
<li>What if there was a tiny toolkit that enabled all kinds of connection/arrows to be built? </li>
<li>How do we break arrows out from spatial canvases and enable them to used on any website?</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently I'm prototyping some pre-built arrows/connection: curved arrows, orthogonal edges, Xanadu links and hyperedges. But the library is also explicitly designed to be extensible so you can use your own layout algorithms or designs. Part of the extensibility means the ability to easily animate objects along the arrow (for all of those dataflow VPLs out there 😜) or add arbitrary labels/annotations to arrows.</p>
<p>Given that connection is probably one of the most commonly used relationships in visual programming systems, I'm curious if there are any other types of arrows or functionality you would find useful in your own projects? Its not published to NPM yet, but the repo is <a href="https://github.com/Little-Languages/quiver">here</a>.</p>

<p>Ink &amp; Switch are having a hack week, and I'm working on a generative sound project. You can check out the current version (likely to change as the week progresses) here: <a href="https://tonedome.surge.sh">tonedome.surge.sh</a></p>
<p>It sounds a little different every time you run it, but it's also synced to the system clock. So if you run it on, say, every device you own and scatter them around the room, it creates a rather neat immersive aural space.</p>
<p>Would appreciate any bug reports, especially on Android!</p>

<p>I'm exploring strategies to enable scientists (biologists in pharma) without computational expertise be able to interact with big data more intuitively. My ultimate goal is to have users ask biological questions, and the system to generate and execute analytical workflows utilizing existing methods from the scientific domain to answer these questions with data visualizations,</p>
<p>I evaluated the non-interpretable and inaccurate "chat your data" LLM solutions. I'm currently thinking about the possibilities of developing/using a DSL as intermediary output prior to code generation to make the process more interpretable. I am also considering what would be the most efficient abstraction strategies of the analytical functionalities/libraries in certain biological domains to improve the accuracy of the outputs (of the higher level strategy and the actual code). I would love to brainstorm about these problems offline/online.

<p>I am once again looking at pages of notes I wrote three years ago attempting to find a way to declaratively diagram concurrent legal processes so as to illuminate the steps available to the parties as the process unfolds. I feel like I have something worth exploring, but to illustrate it I need a diagramming language that allows me to nest nodes inside of one another, and draw edges that originate and terminate at arbitrary depths of nodes. DOT won't let you draw an arrow starting at the edge of a subgraph, and doesn't have any way of nesting actual nodes, for example. Is anyone aware of a text-based graphing language that will let me nest objects and draw edges between arbitrary depths?</p>

<p>I've been thinking about this tweet from John Carmack (who created Doom), and just generally about a future where AI does most of the coding and I'm managing AI - and... I hate it? It's not to say that I don't see this happening. There's a ton of capital flying around to make it happen, and I think end-users will inevitably gain the capability to build certain categories of simple, customised software.</p>
<p>But as someone who has deeply loved the practice of programming for more than a decade, the future that GitHub (who - in the midst of me writing this - launched Copilot Workspace), Devin, and the rest are painting seems to be leaving out so much of nuances that comes with building anything non-trivial. I absolutely love the idea of operating at a higher level of abstraction (just like how I enjoy writing modern programming languages compared to C or assembly) and getting my ideas/work out faster. But not spending my entire day just asking AI to do things or reviewing code all day - which makes me wonder: how do developers even get good at reviewing code if they aren't spending a ton of time writing code and problem solving? What's the right level of abstraction in this "promised future" that lets me get into the nuances of building software for anything non-trivial and continue problem solving in general? This is perhaps not even a question, and just a general thought I've been thinking a lot about.</p>

<p>I am looking around for tools / frameworks / UI patterns that are roughly of the shape "spreadsheet with editable computation pipeline". What do people know of that's in that category?</p>
<p>To clarify, I realise spreadsheets alone can achieve computation... but I am thinking more of projects where the computation is a bit more "visual" than just formulas in cells, perhaps like a nodes or blocks environment that then feeds into a table / spreadsheet to display data. <strong>@Paul Shen</strong>'s Natto is one such example of the kind of thing I am thinking of. There might be other ways to do this beyond just a series of nodes that feed into a table... I'm curious to see what else might be out there already. I wonder if there are projects in the data analysis / computational science spaces that might fit...?</p>
<p>Apologies if my question is too vague, I'm still trying to work out what I'm even looking for. 🙂</p>

<p>The future of code involves waiting for Copilots (Even though they get faster all the time, we'll just ask more and more of them).</p>
<p>We took a stab at visualizing the design decisions that our Copilot makes while it's coding the design you've prompted it for.</p>
<p>Instead of just spinners or the raw stream of text like chat UIs, we overlay this visualization where the design will appear on the canvas. Each visualization reflects a design variant that Copilot works on, and is computed in real-time based on the token streams from the LLM.</p>

<p>Ok, I've been thinking a lot about composable systems recently, and why I don't find visual programming languages like blueprints very flexible. Wrote up a blog post about it. Basically, I think the value graph is a more fundamental primitive for computation than execution graphs. <a href="https://johnaustin.io/articles/2024/composability-designing-a-visual-programming-language">Composability: Designing a Visual Programming Language</a></p>

<p>Does anyone else think of "configuring" as distinct from "programming"? Some activities I consider "configuring" and not "programming": much devops work such as Terraform, YML files for build pipelines, even commonly labeled "programming" of a VCR/DVR.</p>

<p>Random thought/question. I've noticed canvas based design tools have converged on a panel configuration of "Layers | Canvas | Properties | (and sometimes Timeline)"-- as opposed solving the underlying needs another way. Is this pattern the end-all-be-all? Or a local maxima? I tend to think the later.</p>

<p>This year I’m helping organize <a href="https://liveprog.org/">LIVE</a>, the Workshop on Live Programming. A lot of folk here in FoC are working on projects related to liveness… I encourage you to consider submitting your work!</p>
<p>(Here, “live programming” means “getting immediate feedback on the behavior of your program even while you’re programming it”. That includes “Learnable Programming”-style interfaces, spreadsheets, notebooks, REPL-y stuff, interfaces for live performances with code, many interfaces for making art with code...)</p>
<p>LIVE is an academic conference, but it’s attracted great work from people both in and outside the academy. Submitting a project to LIVE might be an opportunity to communicate about your work in a new way and get thoughtful feedback on it from a new community. (We have some tips for non-academics in our <a href="https://liveprog.org/#faq">FAQ</a>.)</p>
<p>The submission deadline is  <em>July 7</em> . The workshop will be some day TBD  <em>October 20-25, 2024 in Los Angeles</em> .</p>
<p>Feel free to DM me if you have questions or concerns; I’d be excited to help out. 🙏</p>

It’s not an autocomplete or a copilot. It’s a real AI developer that does all the coding while scientists give it feedback.

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/3vINEOECt9w">In this video</a> I show a small celsius to fahrenheit converter (this is one of the tasks from 7Gui) that I build using my visual programming system and extended it where needed.</p>
<p>The solution uses an observe-variable node-type which triggers a flow when a variable gets set. I've also build a new user-input node with decimal formatting option (in the near future I will extend this to be configurable forms for collecting user-input).</p>
<p>You can see what happens as you type in the celsius or fahrenheit temperature in the input fields (you see the data flowing though the flow). To prevent an infinite loop, the flow-engine uses a call-stack which stops running when a node gets run twice.</p>
<p>I am still thinking of different solutions but for now this works (some nodes gets run unneeded, I think this can be optimized). Per node-call the node-id, scope-id and input port-name is stored on the call-stack, this is needed to keep other things working like the recursive functions in the quicksort example.</p>
<p>The celsius-to-fahrenheit converter can be tried out here : <a href="https://demo.codeflowcanvas.io">demo.codeflowcanvas.io</a> via the examples dropdown.</p>

<p>I've been improving the timeline-slider in my visual programming system code-flow-canvas.. you can try it out here : <a href="https://demo.codeflowcanvas.io">demo.codeflowcanvas.io</a> (best experience is on desktop since the mobile and touch responsiveness is still lacking). </p>
<p>Additionally the state-machine node now also shows its transitions when executing a flow or using the timeline slider. </p>
<p>Also some the nodes that are used to visualize data have been connected to the flow-execution history. Some changes were needed in keeping track of state and updating nodes visually when using the timeline slider. </p>

<p>I've been playing with a new platform that I hope will be quite convivial. Hosted 😬 but no Javascript and seems easy to build and self-host. Created by a single person, so decent chance of staying simple over time. It seems to be a fork of emscripten that's been made habitable. In particular, it includes raylib and some Lua bindings to it, so I'm starting to feel at home.</p>

<p>I ported one of my early LÖVE apps to it, for geometric constructions. There's an app store and I've published my app there, so you should be able to run it for yourself and inspect the source code. (All apps on the app store are available right in the file system, under  <code>/usr/store</code> !)</p>
<p>Disclaimers. It's slow, like dialing up over a phone line. Still lots of bugs. I had to reboot the VM several times while recording this video. Commands often hang or crash, then completely stop working until I reload. It's never lost my data, though. Data is stored in local storage on the browser until you publish something to the app store.</p>

<p>Hi FoC Community 🙂  I'm looking for something that i found a couple of years ago and apparently my fuzzy descriptions fail my zettelkasten or a search engine for that matter. I think I'm looking for a clojure talk in which someone presented also a tool. This tool used a UI of 2 or Three circles as a kind of number REPL which explained for example how the map function works in clojure. I hope that isn'T too vague if you know the name of the tool, that would be very cool. Thank you!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>UIST 2016: Proceedings of the 29th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software &amp; Technology</p>
<p>Aligning and distributing graphical objects is a common, but cumbersome task. In a preliminary study (six graphic designers, six non-designers), we identified three key problems with current tools: lack of persistence, unpredictability of results, and inability to 'tweak' the layout.</p>
<p>We created StickyLines, a tool that treats guidelines as first-class objects: Users can create precise, predictable and persistent interactive alignment and distribution relationships, and 'tweaked' positions can be maintained for subsequent interactions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CHI'17: ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems Session: Spatial &amp; Temporal Design</p>
<p>Traditional graphic design tools emphasize the grid for structuring layout. Interviews with professional graphic designers revealed that they use surprisingly sophisticated structures that go beyond the grid, which we call graphical substrates.</p>
<p>We present a framework to describe how designers establish graphical substrates based on properties extracted from concepts, content and context, and use them to compose layouts in both space and time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most current-day programming languages seem to be based on the idea that computation is slow, so the user and the compiler must work hard to minimize the number of instructions executed.</p>
<p>Compromises to minimize instructions extend so far as to make familiar-looking operators like + and &lt; behave in unintuitive ways. If as a result a program does not work correctly in some cases, it is considered to be the programmer's fault. But it is really the language designer's fault.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/graydon_pub">Graydon Hoare</a> on "text is already a highly-structured graphical notation" via <strong>yoshiki</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>many technical innovations are latent in textual notations. Visually unambiguous yet uniform symbol sets, combinatorial-positional word formation, linear spatio-temporal segregation, punctuation and structured page layout .. these are all technologies in writing that we had to laboriously invent, and they have purposes, advantages! Similarly in coding, we had to invent and adapt technologies from verbal and mathematical notations refined over millennia: lines and columns, indentation, block layout, juxtaposition and precedence, scope, evaluation order, comments, grammars, version control, diff and merge algorithms ... the pile of structuring technologies embedded in the textual representation of programs isn't free, and it isn't useless</p>
<p>So I'm just really cautious when people suggest throwing it all out for some hypothetical reinvention. You need those structures: so you've got an immediate problem of "what are you going to use instead", and a longer-term question of "what makes you think you're not going to wind up right back at the same place ten thousand years of refining graphemes-on-a-page wound up"?</p>

<p>A simple demo, trying to show how a pin-hole camera works.  Not really how it works, but kind of. 😉</p>
<p>The 'film' in the back of the camera is a 'flatland' view of the scene, upside down, of course....</p>

<p>💻 <a href="https://resheet.dev">resheet.dev: A notes-spreadsheet-hybrid for programmers</a> via <strong>Daniel Krüger</strong></p>

<p>I'm currently building <a href="https://resheet.dev">resheet.dev</a>, a notion-spreadsheet-hybrid. Started because I often ran into limitations with Notion and with spreadsheets. In Notion I wanted to be able to just do some calculations (or even have some embedded spreadsheet). Spreadsheets are nice, but I always ran into limitations. I always thought these could easily be overcome by having a more feature-complete programming language. Because I previously failed very hard by being too ambitious, I tried to keep this project simple. ReSheet runs JavaScript with React because of the vast ecosystem and wide adoption.</p>
<p>It was important to me that it's core is simple and extensible: Everything revolves around the concept of a "Block", which can be thought of like a cell in a spreadsheet. Blocks can be nested and you're able to write and then use your custom Block completely in ReSheet itself. As ReSheet itself is just one big Block you can embed ReSheet in itself.</p>
<p>Maybe sometime in the future I'll get to work on a Block for visual and interactive programming, but currently I'm trying to get it reliably working and useful in the current state.</p>
<p>I'd love to hear your feedback and to answer any questions! (Documentation is still lacking. Currently working on adding some example documents (in ReSheet) to better show what's possible)</p>

<p>there's not enough information to recover them from url itself but since they are still working I should resolve them to the originals as fast as possible in case that service is turned off too 😕</p>

<p>Today, I'm trying to get function signatures for all the std lib stuff in JS… at runtime. Current attempt is converting various d.ts files from the typescript package (like, say, es5.d.ts) into a JSON file with just the bits I need. If that fails, I might try parsing the official WebIDL files (that are used to generate these d.ts files — at least, the dom ones).</p>
<p>If there's a much more obvious way to get this info, let me know. I basically just want something that, for a given function (eg: Array.prototype.splice), gives me some basic signature info (eg: 1-2 args with rest, first arg is called "index", optional second is called "delete", rest is "items"). If all else fails I'll just do .length on these functions, but I'd prefer to get names too.</p>

<p>I've been fixing some bugs in the state-machine node-type in my visual programming system "code-flow-canvas" and also added a small media-library node-type which can be used by the show-image node-type.</p>
<p>The show-image node-type can be controlled by the state-machine together with some UI node-types (button and slider).</p>
<p>The show-image node-type also has an ability to change it's css and use flow parameters/variables (currently only the incoming value of a event/value special input-type.. I want to make this more generic in the near future so that you can send custom property-bags "over the wire" to other nodes).</p>
<p>The timeline slider doesn't work together nicely with the slider node-type yet, so I have to work on that further.</p>
<p>This example can be found on <a href="https://demo.codeflowcanvas.io">demo.codeflowcanvas.io</a> in the "examples" drop down: "Simple state machine with image and brightness". </p>

<p>Every week I will dump from tinyletter and re upload one month of the <a href="https://newsletter.futureofcoding.org/">Future of Coding Newsletter</a> and publish it as a message here, that way we can all go over past conversations and links and I have a reason and rhythm to make them available again.</p>
<p>A month re uploaded per week will allow me to catch up faster than "realtime" but still at a pace I can probably keep.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, I noticed how Juan Benet (founder of IPFS) was keeping <a href="https://github.com/jbenet/random-ideas/issues">a list of random software engg ideas</a> in a github repo as issues. Since then I too started keeping my own list of "RFH"s ("Request for Hacks") - similar to Request for Comments and Request for Startups - here: <a href="https://codeberg.org/nilesh/request-for-hacks/issues">codeberg.org/nilesh/request-for-hacks/issues</a> and recently made it public.</p>
<p>Posting ideas in a place where public discussion can take place seems like an excellent way to get open feedback or review. I encourage other programmers to do the same. Perhaps,  <code>/&lt;username&gt;/request-for-hacks</code>  can become a standard way to discover these. 🙂</p>

<p><img alt="Youtube Thumbnail" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/7kgXBifWQXI/hqdefault.jpg"></p>
<p>There's a puzzle game conference called ThinkyCon that's currently running. Some of the talks are about editor tooling (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kgXBifWQXI&amp;t=5591s">like this one</a>, about the dev tooling used for the game A Monster's Expedition), which feels roughly relevant to this community. But there's one talk in particular that I  <em>must</em>  draw your attention to because this is the internet and I need to earn points. The talk is called "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kgXBifWQXI&amp;t=12992s">Rewinding: moving time backwards in planning-based games</a>". The first example they use of a game that ought to have rewind but doesn't is Opus Magnum, a game by Zachtronics that is the spiritual successor to SpaceChem. I'd argue that both of these games are visual programming environments, and that this talk is basically an argument that visual programming deserves the ability to rewind time.</p>

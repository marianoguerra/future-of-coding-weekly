<p>I really like TodePond's video "Screens in Screens in Screens". I've been wanting to do the same kinda thing with mathematical formulas instead of shapes, a kind of "formulas in formulas in formulas", but I'm an awful programmer so I'll describe some math you can do to that effect. Apologies in advance for the shoddy explanation though.</p>
<p>Here's a thing you can do with "screens". You can name screens. Start with some screens A B C. Then if C is inside A, and A and B are the same color, then there is a copy of C inside B. What do you call this copy? "The copy of B from A to C"? It will be convenient if we give it a symbolic name. Call it (A-&gt;B)C. Or if you are really hardcore you can call it just t(A,B,C) where t is a ternary operator describing the result of copying C from A to B. You may think to only consider (A-&gt;B)C when C is inside A, but the math becomes tractable if you consider all screens at once. Then we can stipulate some axioms:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>(A-&gt;A)B = B</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(A-&gt;B)A=B</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(B-&gt;C)(A-&gt;B)=(A-&gt;C)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(A-&gt;(X-&gt;Y)A)=(X-&gt;Y)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first axiom means if you are copying a screen from one screen to itself, you aren't changing anything. The second axiom is "obvious" except for considering (A-&gt;B)A in the first place. The third axiom means if you copy a screen from A to B and then from B to C that is the same as if you were to copy it from A to C directly. It is also shorthand for (B-&gt;C)((A-&gt;B)D) = (A-&gt;C)D for all screens D. The fourth axiom takes a bit more explaining. Basically we want this equation to be true whenever A is in X, and both sides are being used to copy something from A. But our theory at this point doesn't have a predicate for "A is contained in X" so we say it holds in all cases.</p>
<p>With these axioms you can show the operators (A-&gt;B) form an algebraic structure called a group: You can multiply them by performing one copy after the other (C-&gt;D)(A-&gt;B). This operation is associative (I mean, it must be), and has an identity element and inverses. The identity being (A-&gt;A) and the inverse of (A-&gt;B) being (B-&gt;A).</p>
<p>Another perspective is to view screens as points in an affine space (i.e. vector space without a specified origin). Then (A-&gt;B)C can be thought of as (B-A)+C, and each of the axioms above can be interpreted as vector equations. This isn't a good model though because it ends up saying some screens are the same when they should be different. You can still take the above axioms and show that screens form a generalization of affine spaces called torsors.</p>
<p>I'll share more if anybody is interested. It really needs a much longer write up, but I thought somebody might know if its already been done before.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I started a new series of blog posts (or “newsletters”, in Substack parlance) about  <em>simplicity</em> :</p>
<p>1 • <a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/on-simplicity">On simplicity</a> introduces the series with how my thinking about simplicity has changed over the years.</p>
<p>2 • <a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/on-simplicity-2-meaning-ful-design">Meaning-ful design</a> connects simplicity to meaning making and coherence.</p>
<p>3 • <a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/on-simplicity-3-familiarity">Familiarity</a> explores how complex things can be surprisingly simple and why we can’t ignore context.</p>
<p>4 • <a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/on-simplicity-4-reciprocal-realization">Reciprocal realization</a> frames design as a complex dynamic process of mutual adaptation between designer and designed object.</p>
<p>…  <em>I expect about four or five more posts coming after that, but I haven’t written them yet, so I have no idea.</em> 🙂</p>
<p>A lot of this draws on 4E cognitive science, design theory, and philosophy. As such it may perhaps be less technical than you would expect it to be, although I try much harder in this series to relate it more directly to programming and software development than in <a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/previously-a-recap">my last</a>.</p>
<p>And that’s why I post it here, today. I’m hoping to learn if this resonates at all with a technical audience, or if this is still too abstract. I know we’re all craving for the easily applicable  <em>Top 10 Things to Make Things Simple</em>  (and number 6 will surprise you), but I have reason to believe that it’s just not that… well… simple. But I think I’m slowly making progress towards synthesizing something valuable, even if I can’t express it as beautifully as I would like to. Yet.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think, and please ask any questions you may have (in thread or via DM). Appreciate your feedback!</p>

<p>Spinners are boring, so might as well get creative with AI UX for loading states, even with fast LLMs like Mixtral.</p>
<p>The thinking is to not only show multiplayer presence on our canvas, but also what the AI is doing and working on, including visualizing the code its writing in real-time.</p>

<p>I think I have a usable app development experience now on my tablet. I basically took my recent Lua Carousel and made a few changes. In Carousel (first clip) you start in the programming environment, each screen runs a separate script, scripts run in the background of the editor, and each screen manages its own canvas. The new setup (second clip) starts in the app, which takes over the entire device until I 'exit' into the programming environment. In the programming environment, screens are now just editors with a shared 'run' button and canvas. Hopefully I can now finish polishing this  ~turd~  app entirely on the tablet.</p>

<p>So I've only been a real developer again for a month, but holy cow. I would have thought keeping your data persistence layer in sync with your code would be easier than this, by now. Irritating.</p>
<h2>Thinking Together</h2>
<p>💡  Communicating programming ideas by <a href="http://ivanish.ca/">Ivan Reese</a></p>
<p><a href="https://history.futureofcoding.org/history/weekly/2024/01/W2/thinking-together.html#2024-01-01T21:17:17.966Z">🧵 conversation</a></p>
<p>Someone reached out to ask me for more thoughts about communicating programming ideas through media other than the academic paper. I wrote a reply, and then decided it would be worth sharing here to see if other folks have their own inspirations they'd like to share, or ideas for how our industry can go  <em>paper-free</em>  ;)</p>
<hr>
<p>I feel like I owe reading an apology. I certainly try to play up my "crank" side on the podcast, but it does run the risk of mixing-up  <em>this is being silly</em> with  <em>this is thoughtful critique</em> .</p>
<p>I have tremendous reverence for the communicative potential of the written word. I just think there are some kinds of ideas that lend themselves better to other forms of expression, or some ideas that can't be written down.</p>
<p>For instance, it's very strange to me whenever I read a paper about HCI, especially if they're discussing GUI ideas. Sure, often these papers will be accompanied by a video. But, like, the work being described is about  <em>interacting with interfaces</em> . I think the work should be presented as an interface you can interact with!</p>
<p>I'm especially fond of <a href="http://worrydream.com">Bret</a>'s essays, naturally. <a href="https://ciechanow.ski">Bartosz</a> also does great work with visualization, though I feel like he leans a little too heavily on text and that the visualizations are too linear. <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com">Amit</a> also does excellent work, but he has the advantage that most of the things he demos are inherently about interactive graphics so they lend themselves naturally to this sort of presentation (not to diminish the incredible effort Amit puts in to these articles).</p>
<p>The thing I want to see more of is… people finding ideas that can  <em>only</em>  be expressed through interaction. I think successfully achieving this requires that someone work natively in interaction, a lot, for a long time. As a result, most of these ideas seem to emerge in the periphery of video games.</p>
<p>One of my favourite examples is <a href="https://w.itch.io/dys4ia">Dys4ia</a>, a collection of microgames about the trans experience. It uses written language and (meaningfully crude) visual art to set up the  <em>plot</em> , but interaction to tell the  <em>story</em> .</p>
<p>Something I'm very interested in seeing (and have made a few attempts at myself, but nothing worth sharing) is an attempt to create a fully-usable programming environment  <em>presented as a game</em>  specifically for the purpose of communicating ideas about programming. There've been plenty of the inverse, where a programming system is the setting within which a game takes place (see all the works of <a href="http://zachtronics.com">Zachtronics</a>, for instance), but I haven't seen anyone do a game as the setting within which actual programming takes place. Closest to that might be something like Minecraft or Dreams (etc), but I don't think those were designed to communicate ideas about programming the way, say, The Witness was designed to communicate a philosophy of science.</p>
<p>Another close comparison might be Advent of Code, where you playfully approach programming differently than in your normal work. The programming you do for AoC should feel meaningfully different. Similarly, imagine building your own Rosetta Code from scratch. That should give you a really particular feeling. I think it's related to, say, the feeling of writing a rasterizer for the dozenth time. I think these feelings are ideas, and that there's a whole language of them, and that the language is expressed through the creation of systems. I think if we studied this language, it would guide us toward building different kinds of tools.</p>
<p>And hell, you might eventually be able to write a paper about that. (Countdown to someone arguing that this is what Christopher Alexander has made a career of, in a sense.) But I don't think we will arrive at those system-feeling ideas in any way other than by building and playing with systems, and with a particular intention at that.</p>

<p>I don't know if you're familiar with this harvard linguist on tiktok but he's the best: <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@etymologynerd?lang=en">tiktok.com/@etymologynerd</a></p>
<p>I think it would be AWESOME if someone from "our community" would make those style of tiktoks, but about computer and programming history. I think it would become quite popular and be super enriching and educational</p>
<p>I have some amount of capacity to help and sponsor this, but I mostly wanted to put it out there as a general request for someone in our community to take up the gauntlet in this new medium</p>

<p>Heya internetpeoples ❤ I’ve spent a long time refining this and brought in “The LLMs” to help craft the tone here, and I think I’ve finally gotten it to a point where I feel like it hits my message and question, and doesn’t assume too much negativity or… doomcalling, heh. Thanks for the time and shared space, as always.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’ve despaired when stuck on problems I just couldn’t crack. I’ve also felt the joy of those “aha!” moments when things finally click. We’ve all been there as coders. While documentation and searches can help fill gaps, little replaces another human sitting alongside, guiding with patience earned from experience. In those moments when someone more seasoned gave guidance, I felt hope renewed. How might we foster more of these vital human connections?</p>
<p>Key Discussion Points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Knowledge flows when passion meets patience</em> . I’m grateful for the patient coders who “reached down” to guide me. Let’s discuss barriers hampering these relationships. Generalizations about certain groups being “unwilling” to help are counterproductive. However, empathetic mentorship remains scarce. How might we change incentives?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Truly supporting newcomers requires understanding their frustrations are valid. I want to open a thoughtful discussion on constructive ways we can keep improving in this regard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are always exceptions by those dedicated to lifting others up. But much room remains for improving access, channels and incentives for more direct peer sharing across experience levels. It’s on each of us to reflect on where we can have an impact.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I welcome reactions, shared experiences, and dialogue toward that aim. How might we strengthen coder communities through human connections? Where do you see the biggest opportunities? Together, I believe we can guide positive change.</p>

<p>I ran across <a href="https://cassette-lang.com/">Cassette</a>, a programming language today. I liked some of the stuff on the webpage and think it is interestingly aligned with the Future of Coding community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I made Cassette as a simple language for “playful programming”. Playful programming is writing something for the sake of writing it. It’s making a software 3D renderer or a GIF reader, even though better implementations of those already exist. It’s making generative art programs and drawing them with a pen plotter. Cassette itself is playful programming—there are certainly other scripting languages that may be better for personal projects like these, but this one is mine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Continuing,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In particular, I wanted Cassette to feel “essential”, where each aspect of the language reflects some fundamental aspect of computing</em> 
 (from a functional language perspective, at least). For example, I consider garbage collection, lexical scopes, and immutable types essential. The result is a little boring, but I hope it’s a good platform to play with other programming concepts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The perhaps most melodramatic thing I've ever written about software. Sat in my to publish folder for a while. But I realized I am just a bit melodramatic, no one will care :)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Theory creation, world-building, and crafting software are all one in the same activity. Removing any of these elements eliminates the very value you hired software engineers to provide. But it does more than that. It forces these software engineers to make a difficult choice: fight to create the world they believe in, or give up and live in a world they are no longer invested in.</p>

<p>In the spirit of clearly communicating what you're signing up for, this podcast episode is nearly three hours long, and among other things it contains a discussion of a paper by author Mary Shaw titled <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3480947">Myths &amp; Mythconceptions</a> which takes as an organizing principle a collection of myths that are widely believed by programmers, largely unacknowledged, which shape our views on the nature of programming  <em>as an activity</em>  and the needs of programmers  <em>as people</em>  and the sort of work that we do  <em>as a sort of work</em> , and where by acknowledging these myths the three of us (Mary Shaw primarily, and by extension Jimmy and I, those three people, that's it, no other people appear on this podcast) are able to more vividly grip the image of programming with our mind's eye (or <a href="https://aphantasia.com">somesuch</a>) and conceive of a different formulation for programming, and in addition to these myths this paper also incudes a number of excellent lists that I take great pleasure in reading, beyond which I should also note that the paper does a job of explaining itself and that hopefully you'll find I've done a similar job, that's the spirit, please enjoy.</p>

<p>I've written a couple of programs now that have felt too large for this particular devlog, which I've been trying to limit to a size I can comfortably edit on a phone, around 200 lines or so.. 🤔</p>

<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/YtDvPAfJ8jE">this video</a> I show an implementation of the quicksort algorithm using my visual programming system and not only that, but also the different steps of the output of the algorithm are visualized using a node tree. </p>
<p>One thing I noticed when making these kinds of algorithm flows, that they tend to grow horizontally quickly. So, to help prevent that, I've introduced the concept of "decorators" (they are in the "stacked" nodes). Decorators can be added before or after node-types that support this. </p>
<p>Now at least flows can also grow vertically a bit more. In the future I also want to be able to combine multiple nodes in a component or grouped node. </p>
<p>There are currently only 2 decorator types: expressions and sending data to the node-tree. Editing is not yet possible via the editor itself but only directly in the underlying json data of a flow. Also I needed to improve the way scoped variables work with regard to recursive functions, the same for the "merge"-node-type. Each node receives a scopeId depending on the scope within it is executed (every call to a function creates a new scope, this scopeId is passed to the function-node which passes it through to its connected nodes and so on).</p>

<p>Thought about a new architecture for my tool that would make it play better with LLMs, so as to get more help with generating code. Built an MVP version of it over the last week, or so, with just text-based code, and it works well enough that I'm going to have to re-implement my visual language in the new architecture.</p>

<p>Hey everyone! 👋 I’m a student who’s been working on a side project to explore how LLMs may augment creative problem solving.</p>
<p>I’ve synthesised everything into a rough concept I would love to hear your perspectives on:</p>
<p>~<em><em>Here is a quick demo:</em></em>~  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDRg5WgSrm0"> A tool to augment creative problem-solving. </a></p>
<p>Initial inspirations include Jef Raskin’s “Archy”, Mozilla’s old “Ubiquity” project, the thinking of Vannevar Bush, and recent tools like “mymind”. There are still many ideas and user experience concerns to be properly fleshed out, but hopefully it’s an interesting direction.</p>

<p>I built a little voice recorder in Lua Carousel last night</p>
<p>One little detail here involves Android permissions. I almost ended up asking for microphone permissions in Lua Carousel. Luckily I managed to stop and ask myself what the user experience is. "Hi, I'm Lua Carousel, could I please have access to your mic?" Ick! It seems like a bad idea to ask for a permission for the whole app just in case some single script uses it. Probably affects the conversions from this particular blog post, but I don't want to feel like I'm contributing to the general fatigue over apps asking for permissions. 🤷</p>

<p>aside: The whole issue of passwords and permissions is a  <em>huge</em>  UX issue that deserves a long discussion on of-end-user-programming.  Users should be allowed to  <em>just use</em>  a device without being forced to answer a bunch of questions about technical issues and needing to keep a bowl full of anti-anxiety meds nearby.

<p>I've been enjoying the "<a href="https://www.tadiweb.com">tadi web</a>" approach Lu has been espousing lately. I also had some nice discussions at Strange Loop with Devine and a few others about minimizing friction / dependencies / build steps, both broadly but also specifically pertaining to publishing one's personal site. So in this spirit, I've been reworking my personal site a bit. I plan to finally add RSS and, even though it goes against the spirit of Lu and Devine's approaches, add a more complex build process that enables some functionality I've long wanted.</p>

<p>I was exploring a domain outside programming today and thought "gee, I wonder if somebody has written a detailed end-to-end case study about this?' Then, I wondered, "gee, has anybody written a detailed end-to-end case study about a software project?"</p>
<p>I always think of software as a very open and sharing community, where we talk about our work and learn from each other without too much secrecy. But I struggled to think of examples. Of course, we seem to be constantly publishing tiny, focused case studies as blog posts. And this is incredible and valuable. But my curiosity is now piqued about this other thing.</p>

<p>Hey all! All abuzz that I’ve finally pushed the alpha version up of my Metal-based 3D code visualizer apps. After many months, I’ve finally gotten in my place:</p>
<ul>
<li>A brand new and extremely amateurish Metal rendering “engine” focused primarily on character glyphs.</li>
<li>An, “is this a joke?” UTF8-&gt;UTF32-&gt;UnicodeGraphemeCluster GPU based text parser and basic layout engine.</li>
<li>Download GitHub repositories in-app and view arbitrary textual files.</li>
<li>Reset your atlas if you stumble into new languages online 🤓</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve got an iPhone, iPad, or Mac device, I’d be happy to invite ya to the TestFlight to give the app a whirl where you’d like. Desktop builds and releases coming upon next coffee intake ritual.</p>

I got hired start and head up the Unison Cloud project, which today we are starting to open up to early adopters: <a href="https://www.unison.cloud/">unison.cloud</a> The idea is that we want to make it as easy as possible to go from some function from  <code>HttpRequest -&gt; HttpServer</code>  to a deployed service, but we also want to give a rich and modern distributed programming interface to that function.   Hit me up if you want to get access to the Beta!</p>

<p>I heard that day-5 part two was a curveball, so I really want to be able to implement it using my visual programming system... which failed so far. Using a brute force solution would mean that the program would run very very long. And my current "speed run" solution wouldn't suffice for this. </p>
<p>Part one actually provided a big challenge for my vps as well, running the program with the small test dataset can be seen in the video: <a href="https://youtu.be/td0QeePvfGQ">youtu.be/td0QeePvfGQ</a> . I've spend a lot of time adding more new node-types this weekend (like handling a while-loop and improved array handling) and making changes to the variable-nodes and expressions. Also the variable scoping (needed for local function variables) that I implemented had some flaws, so I fixed that as well. You can now define global and scoped variables. I've also made some simple variable visualizers that better show the data for data types like dictionary/array and grid. </p>
<p>My current vps solution works better than the flow-based vps that I was building last year. A big difference is that the data that is send from node to node is now just a single value. That value can still be of different types (number, string, array).. and special variable-nodes are needed to keep track of data. These variables also have a type like number, string, array, dictionary, grid. Often working with a single value is not enough and that's why these variables are needed. They can be referenced from within expressions. Also being able to run some flow-parts in parallel or sequentially helps a lot. This starts to feel much more like a regular 3rd gen programming language. </p>
<p>The UI is currently quite limited.. to be able to create a flow program efficiently it definitely needs a lot of work. Textual programming is much faster. I want to finish at least one of the advent of code puzzles where a grid is involved .. so today's puzzle (17) seems like a good fit. I'll probably work on that next weekend.</p>

<p>One nice reusable abstraction my LÖVE apps have all converged on is an immediate-mode button primitive. I draw all my buttons each frame along with all the callbacks they need, and a couple of framework-y lines of code in the mouse-press callback is all it takes to get them working. Last night I realized (while poking inside <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=236661&amp;sid=2693d6bb97fdec2945964df8ab60a34a#p236661">Re: Conway's game of life</a>) that my hacky sliders in Lua Carousel's settings admit a similar abstraction (even better than the one there). The only additional complexity is it needs a couple more lines in the  <code>update</code>  callback that continually refresh the backing value as you drag the slider.</p>

<p>Finally starting to see a workflow come together in my editor. Here you can see Fibonacci at three different levels in the language I'm making. These functions live in three different files. Looking at them at once and comparing them isn't easily supported in any other editor I use. On the left is a simplistic symbol browser.</p>
<p>I'm super excited that I'm slowly getting to the point where I can do these kinds of things. Having different views of our codebases that we can switch between is something I've been wanting for years.</p>

<p>I'm making a system for working with loosely structured tables in spreadsheets. Tables/lists in sheets represent collections of things, however formulas and drag-filling works at an item-level (cell-level) abstraction. This causes a lot of problems – duplicated effort, hard to do lookups across tables, errors when new data is added. However, committing to a structure upfront (a SQL style table for example) has a big cost. An effective system would allow users to gradually introduce structure that works with whatever rich table they draw.</p>
<p>Right now I'm onto a language for pulling data from such rich tables. It works by manipulation of the ranges (rectangles) pointed to by Labels. Queries can be made by intersecting/unioning rectangles (in picture is a small example). What ideas/projects would you recommend looking at in this space? I've looked around a fair bit for "2D grammar" and "spatial programming language" but haven't had much luck.</p>

<p>Today, is there a way to build state-driven UI components (like React/Vue/Svelte) where some of the state, but not all, can be persisted periodically in the backend perhaps as an event log which would enable things like playback of past interactions? How would you go about creating something like this with usual tools like Javascript, REST and Postgresql? 🤔</p>

<p>Status video about Kinopio2md (Kinopio to Markdown). What is not said is that the blue boxes are source code for the app (the compiler compiles the drawings to executable code).  I deal with a bunch of different programming languages, picking the best one for each step along the way (approximately 10, if you include English). I want to document more deeply the use of the Transpiler in, say, the “Escape Whitespace” Component (and others), but, I haven’t gotten around to it yet</p>

<p>Oh boy.. it was a lot of work being able to solve advent of code puzzle 7 (part 1) in my visual programming system.. as you can see in the video <a href="https://youtu.be/kkgJQdJXFtk">youtu.be/kkgJQdJXFtk</a>. I had to implement a lot new node-types for handling dictionaries and a new scoped-variable type. This scoped-variable can have different types.. currently just a regular value or a dictionary. This dictionary is used in a function-flow to determine the hand type which is needed in this puzzle. Also custom sorting was needed (I implemented a Schwartzian transform in the sort node-type). Running the flow for the full puzzle input takes a long time so I don't show that in the video (although I've added a "full-speed" mode that helps a bit). I've also added some colors to better show when some nodes are active, especially handy for nodes that run longer like a foreach, function-call, map or sort.</p>

<p>What if web frameworks offered a standard way to discover capabilities that are then given to AI as tools? A  <code>document.getTools()</code>  perhaps?</p>
<p>This could be achieved simply with plugins for NextJS, VueJS, SvelteKit etc. Small convention that eliminates a lot of brittleness when web agents try to discover capabilities and invoke them.</p>

<p>Hi all, I've been inactive here for a long time. Progress on my big project, a collaborative mobile-friendly development environment, has been very slow. However, along the way I've built some libraries which may be of interest to some people here.</p>
<p>On the languages and parsing side, I've built <a href="https://github.com/jhp/recursive-grammar-literal">recursive grammar literals</a> which lets you write CFGs as normal javascript functions. And <a href="https://github.com/jhp/church-cat">church-cat</a> which lets you compute over a tree structure, e.g. annotate a parse tree.</p>
<p>On the UI side I've built <a href="https://github.com/jhp/imperative">imperative</a> which is a frontend javascript library much like React, but based on generators and structured concurrency. And most recently I've been working on <a href="https://github.com/jhp/palimpsest">Palimpsest</a> which covers the backend of web development with a more functional or "event-sourced" style where data sources are computed as folds over input streams. My interest there is to allow stateful applications to be more easily shared, forked, and extended by their users etc.</p>

<p>We just published a new demo of Plato's PBD subsystem. Much more powerful than our previous implementation.</p>
<p>PBD is historically difficult to generalize and make practical, but it seems that once you take it out of the desktop metaphor and apply it to relational data where queries are more explicit, it does quite well.</p>
<p>I suspect this could become the most prevalent way of automating app logic without coding.</p>

<p>Hi All</p>
<p>I’m almost “done” with my VR visual/spatial programming app, Pebble Graphics 🎉 (“done” because I still see a lot of things that could be improved, but there are other projects I’m excited to start so I’m shipping what I have). It’s a VR version of turtle graphics with some interactive program stepping and 3D visualizations of things like state change and execution history.</p>
<p>I made a trailer you can watch (and listen to 🎶) here <a href="https://youtu.be/Fl3DjzTdUo8?si=bWi7CWwbXIQh_wUw">Pebble Graphics Trailer</a>. If you have a Quest headset and want to try it out, I set up a Beta release while I try to get it into Meta’s App Lab app store. This link <a href="https://www.meta.com/s/2Rlda8ess">meta.com/s/2Rlda8ess</a> should work otherwise feel free to DM me the email address associated with your Oculus/Meta account.</p>

<p>Pebble Graphics is a 3D visual and interactive programming system that lets you create and explore geometric patterns in virtual reality.

<p>Last year I used the advent of code to test the visual programming environment that I was building at that time.. and it helped me to come to the conclusion to start over.. which I did at the beginning of this year. So... the time has come to test my new environment and let advent of code help me improve and extend it. Hopefully this year I won't need to decide to start over😅. To finish the first challenge I needed to extend my vps with new node types or tweak some other stuff like be able to execute regex expressions and load external files as input to a flow. For the second part of day 1 a special node needed to be created to handle the sneaky replace string functionality that was needed. A very nice update that I made is the possibility to run parts of flow in parallel instead of sequential and use the results in the upstream nodes. </p>
<p>And talking about upstream nodes... since last week it's also possible to drag all upstream or downstream nodes at once when reorganizing a flow using UI elements(it can be seen in the video). </p>
<p>In the flow-engine I also use standalone nodes that represent global variables which can be used in other nodes. </p>
<p>I'll definitely not make it to the AoC leaderboard (it's not a goal anyway).. however.. I think I am getting a lot of value out of this already..even on day 1.</p>

<p>Been making slow, but steady progress on my editor. I can properly zoom in and out on the canvas. I can have some panes that represent sub-file things. The power usage when idle is basically non-existent (down from 100% cpu usage always). I finally feel like things are starting to come together and that I can finish up some parts and then really start focusing on actually making the flow and features fit how I code.</p>
<p>Hopefully soon I can start using it for a project that isn't coding itself so I am forced to add all the features I've been ignoring.</p>

<p>hi! tinyletter (the service I use for the FoC newsletter) is closing down, to finish the last stage of going completely self hosted I plan to export the subscriber list, put it in a csv, do a for loop and use some mail api to send it.

<p>I've demoed my Kopi language and Rect-Desktop projects a few weeks ago. In my experience writing Kopi, I've always wanted to write a "How to Write a Programming Language" tutorial based on it, since the core language is simple and familiar (infix operators, assignment, anonymous functions, etc.). Here's the start of something (written in Markdown, presented using the React-Desktop Markdown app:</p>

<p>It's in an early draft. I like presenting ideas very incrementally, and being able to see and even interact with each small change. You can modify any of input or parser code and see the result value change.</p>

<p>Followup on my  <code>~_*Colorful types*_~</code>  project. I’m trying to create a  <code>~_*map*_~</code>  for a codebase with different zoom levels.</p>
<p>I have been thinking about having 3 zoom levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1: Only colors for both types &amp; functions</li>
<li>Level 2: Colors and names for types, functions and parameters</li>
<li>Level 3: Shows the entire source file (maybe with some extra color sugar on top?) </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a couple of screenshots of level 1 &amp; 2, and video of the WIP interface.</p>
<p>PS. Anyone have good recommendations of typescript codebases with a couple dozen source code files which I can use for testing?</p>

<p>More progress on a lightweight programming environment that runs on Linux, Windows, Mac, Android, iOS. Also modifiable live while it runs (though not on mobile devices).</p>
<p>The seed design constraint here was to structurally prevent the pop-up keyboard on a touchscreen from ever blocking my typing. That led to this design of a multi-line commandline editor in the top half, fixing the non-editable output buffer in the bottom half. Independent commands/scripts then expanded in the only other direction available: left/right.</p>

<p>Solo independent researchers we know often discuss the challenge of working alone. Being part of a research group can create community, social accountability, provide feedback, and just give you someone to talk to when you’re feeling stuck or bored. This is why we started our Researchers-in-Residence program.</p>

<p>Which made me think "this could be something we set up in FoC!"</p>

<p>Hi, in this weeks video I show a new node type in which a prompt can be entered which is used to create HTML via openai gpt4. It's quite powerful .. the created nodes can receive and visualize input data from another node. This is offcourse inspired by makeitreal from tldraw which uses gpt4-vision-preview. I have been playing with the prompt to get the result that I wanted, although the results are not consistent when recreating the html using the same prompt. Still, very cool that this is possible.</p>

<p>Achievement unlocked: I've built an app large enough[1] that it crashes my programming environment that puts all the code on a spatial surface.</p>
<p>The problem: I do this snazzy initial animation (see video) that takes in the whole thing before zooming back in somewhere. That animation works by drawing the whole surface to an in-memory canvas before transforming it. Turns out drawing to a canvas still uses the video card, and I don't have enough video RAM for a virtual "monitor" of this resolution.</p>
<p>[1] Or spread out enough. It's not really about lines of code, just how much area the code occupies.</p>

<p>I was leafing through my father's old books when this diagram caught me off-guard.</p>
<p>We're so used now to having an OS with apps, that it's weird to think of OS-level transitions (login-&gt;shell), inter-apps transitions (shell-&gt;vi) and inside-app transitions (vi's command&lt;-&gt;append modes) as similar things. 🙃</p>
<p>But to a user new to computers, yes these are all "modes".</p>

<p>I think that often the most difficult part of programming is debugging: humans aren't very good at "seeing" how an app operated when it failed. You get some log output that might or might not have references to the correct file locations.</p>
<p>I don't see any reason, in the long term, why humans would be better than machines at debugging. How to make that happen? I assume somebody is building this already. Would it help if an AI with a large context window + access to the VM could see the whole call logs/tree and see exactly what is going on?  AI could learn from other users, see everything that happens in a run without debugger/console.logs, try multiple solutions in parallel, and fix issues while you sleep.</p>
<p>Thoughts on this?</p>

<p>Ink &amp; Switch just released a new essay: <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/embark/">Embark — Dynamic documents for making plans</a>.</p>
<p>Starting from a desire to "unbundle the app" in the name of malleable software, they explore using a bullet-point outliner as a substrate for dynamic properties, computations, and views. They ground the work with a specific use case — trip planning — and they hard-code a bunch of stuff that ought to be pushed into user space, granted. But it's easy to look at this, imagine how it could be expanded, and see some really compelling possibilities for a different way to approach creating and distributing software.</p>

<p>The subject of this episode’s paper — <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/propositions-as-types/propositions-as-types.pdf">Propositions as Types</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Wadler">Philip Wadler</a> — is one of those grand ideas that makes you want to go stargazing. To stare out into space and just disassociate from your body and become one with the heavens.  <em>Everything — life, space, time, existence — all of it is a joke!</em>  A cosmic ribbing delivered by the laws of the universe or some higher power or, perhaps, higher order. Humanity waited two thousand years, from the time of the ancient Greeks through until the 1930s, for a means to answer questions of calculability, when three suddenly arrived all at once:</p>
<ul>
<li>General recursive functions by Gödel in 1934, with functions of sets of natural numbers.</li>
<li>Lambda calculus by Alonzo Church in 1936, with anonymous single-variable functions.</li>
<li>Turing machines by Alan Turing in 1937, with a process for evaluating symbols on a tape.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then it was discovered that these three models of computation were, in fact, perfectly equivalent. That any statement made in one could be made in the others. A striking coincidence, sure, but not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_discovery">without precedent</a>. But  <em>then</em>  it was quietly determined (in 1934, again in 1969, and finally published in 1980) that computation itself is in a direct correspondence with logic. That every proposition in a given logic corresponds with a type in a given programming language, every proof corresponds with a program, and the simplification of the proof corresponds with the evaluation of the program.</p>
<p>The implications boggle the mind.  <em>How could this be so?</em>  Well, how could it be any other way? Why did it take so long to discover? What other discoveries like this are perched on the precipice of revelation?</p>
<p>Philip Wadler is here to walk us through this bit of history, suggest answers to some of these questions, and point us in a direction to search for more.</p>
<p>And  <em>we</em>  are here, dear listener, to level with you that a lot of this stuff is miserably hard to approach, presented with the symbols and language of formal logic that is so often inscrutable to outsiders. By walking you through Wadler’s paper (and the much more approachable <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOiZatlZtGU">Strange Loop talk</a>), and tying it in with the cultural context of modern functional programming, we hope you’ll gain an appreciation for this remarkable, divine  <em>pun</em>  that sits beneath all of computation.</p>

<p>I seem to have renewed my collaboration for a tablet-friendly programming environment. For the <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=94852">current version</a>, my partner led and pushed for preserving LÖVE primitives. For example, the LÖVE event loop calls functions you define called  <code>love.draw</code> ,  <code>love.keypressed</code> , etc., and it seems desirable to continue to support those for familiarity's sake. This can seem impossible if the environment is also built in LÖVE and uses those same functions for providing its infrastructure, but since Lua is a dynamic environment there are tricks to make it work reasonably nicely.</p>
<p>Lately I've been taking the lead on a riff of that project, and I find I'm advocating strongly to  <em>not</em>  do this. I want to define new handlers like  <code>shell.draw</code>  and  <code>shell.keypressed</code>  that programs within my environment will have to call. And I finally figured out why I feel so strongly about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>LÖVE has a function to return the bounds of the device/window. You typically can draw between x coordinates 0 and some width. And this information is often used to draw UI elements near the edges and corners. So should we now override functions like  <code>line</code>  to adjust coordinates and keep them in the client area? There's a lot of surface area to cover here. Bugs will inevitably happen, and when they do our attempts to create a seamless abstraction will cause more confusion.</li>
<li>Ranting more broadly, the desire for a "seamless experience" is a disease. The provider wants to "own the customer relationship," so that the user can forget there's anything in the universe but themselves and the app. Just like a casino. I'd rather not pretend we can wish the universe away with its possibility of errors. Let's me and the user treat each other as grown-ups, and not hide irreducible complexity in our supply chains. Here are the functions I provide, here are the functions LÖVE provides. I recommend you use my stuff where possible, but you don't have to. Yes, it's confusing. Welcome.</li>

<p>Hi, since I've started building visual programming systems, I have always used a push-based approach where a node triggers another node that follows it. This is much inspired by flow based programming. But since I want to build a generic visual programming system, I think that it is also important to support different ways.. basic statecharts I already support, but a pull-based system is not yet something that I had build with my system. Until now! .. so in this video you can see how I construct a flow that is used to construct a glsl fragment shader. Here the output node pulls in the data from the node's cominh before it in the flow, so working backwards through a flow. </p>
<p>Although it's not my goal to build a full product around this alone.. a lot better and much more extensive applications already exist for building shaders this way. But still helpful to look at my project from a different perspective, which leads to some refactoring, bug fixing, insights and inspiration.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was really in doubt if this was the right route for this week's time spent on my project because of the awesome demo that tldraw made with gpt4-vision api, very cool! So,I also had to play with it together with my own application and was also amazed with the possibilities! Probably my next video will have this as a topic. Anyway, for now, enjoy my short video where I construct a very simple shader which runs on the GPU via webgl.</p>

<p>I built a Magic Inky interface at work a while back. A metadata editor that presented as a nested bulleted list of English sentences with clickable words, like:</p>
<p>“From [time T1] to [time T2], an [event type] happens with [property P], and it’s very [adjective].”</p>
<p>The event descriptions are highly multi-dimensional and resonate well with this information design, though the timestamps suffer a bit. They want to be on a timeline, but I didn’t have the budget. Despite this, the UI has saved us loads of time and people  ~<em><em>love</em></em>~  the sentence-based configuration compared to the forty-column table of dropdowns they envisioned when I started the project.</p>
<p>The biggest failure was that enforcing a few global constraints was  ~<em><em>also</em></em>~  outside my budget. Lacking those has led to data loss—never more than a few minute’s worth, but still. I felt bad. Thankfully, someone else recently picked up the project and will be correcting those omissions.</p>
<p>But we disagreed immediately on how to do it! I thought we should  ~<em><em>present</em></em>~  the errors: “These events overlap!” The other person thought we should make the errors impossible: when you edit a timestamp, you implicitly edit all the others that are involved in the constraint.</p>
<p>I generally agree with their approach. I mean, it’s baked into the rest of the UI. When you change an event type, it changes the rest of the sentence. But if you change the type back, the sentence structure is restored and your previous values all come back. Cascading edits are more destructive than that. They force you to be careful about what you change and to be observant of unintended side-effects.</p>
<p>The block editor problem of representing invalid states is another way to look at it. Sometimes the most efficient path between two valid states passes through an invalid one. If you want to reorder two events, for example, a first step might be to copy the start and end times from one to the other, as part of an “a = b; b = oldA” sequence. They overlap until you’re done. To do the same without ever breaking global constraints requires user ingenuity or a more featureful editor with a “swap events” button. Requiring user ingenuity wastes a lot of time and energy and happiness over the lifetime of the UI, but observing users and adding features to address every desired editing operation takes a lot of dev time too, and it has to happen  ~<em><em>now</em></em>~ , or else people editing this data will be blocked whenever they find an impossible edit.</p>
<p>Anyway, not too many answers here, but I thought it was an interesting case study, with thought-provoking  ~<em><em>questions</em></em>~  at least!</p>

<p>An idea is starting to form for me around prototype-based modeling being a good metaphor for programming effectively with LLMs. Essentially you can provide an example of a patttern/component/class/etc and have it return a version of it modified in specific ways, which can then be used as a prototype for future generations/instantiations.</p>
<p>A version of this idea can be seen <a href="https://twitter.com/mrmkrs/status/1725959207365583196">here with tldraw</a> where he generates the next more specific interface step off the previous one.</p>
<p>Another I'm kind of using this in my agent framework: <a href="https://github.com/sublayerapp/sublayer/blob/main/lib/sublayer/agents/generate_sublayer_agent_agent.rb">generate_sublayer_agent_agent.rb</a> where we generate new agents based off a simple agent template (and works surprisingly well).</p>
<p>I know Hofstatder digs into this concept in GEB and Steve Yegge calls it the <a href="https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/10/universal-design-pattern.html">Universal Design Pattern</a></p>
<p>Does this resonate with anyone here? Is anyone familiar with any other writing about prototype-based modeling/prototypal inheritance/etc for me to take this further?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.applevis.com/forum/app-development-programming/work-progress-vosh-third-party-screen-reader-macintosh">I’m excited to see where this 3rd party screen-reader for macOS goes.</a> On windows there are 2 first-in-class options available outside of the OS, JAWS and NVDA. On macOS there is only the system provided VoiceOver.</p>
<p>I think VoiceOver is a pretty solid competitor to NVDA, but, it is very very very opinionated, and makes some unusual choices. I think this has a knock on effect where, since VoiceOver is the easiest screen-reader for most web devs to reach for, a lot of implementations end up being hyper-focused on supporting VoiceOver’s specific flavor of handling the accessibility tree. Having more diversity in the space, I think could hopefully mitigate this. While this isn’t directly related to the future of coding as we normally talk about it here, I think projects like this are just the sort of thing that can help to shape things for years to come.</p>

<p>“shouldn’t this have been published a few months ago?” yeah, probably. I even considered submitting it to the AoC contest. time is a real beast.
The title is clickbait. I did not design and implement a programming language for the sole or even primary purpose of leaderboarding on Advent of Code. It just turned out that the programming language I was working on fit the task remarkably well.
I can’t name just a single reason I started work on my language, Noulith, back in July 2022, but I think the biggest one was even more absurdly niche: I solve and write a lot of puzzlehunts, and I wanted a better programming language to use to search word lists for words satisfying unusual constraints, such as, “Find all ten-letter words that contain each of the letters A, B, and C exactly once and that have the ninth letter K.”1 I have a folder of ten-line scripts of this kind, mostly Python, and I thought there was surely a better way to do this. Not necessarily faster — there is obviously no way I could save time on net by optimizing this process. But, for example, I wanted to be able to easily share these programs such that others could run them. I had a positive experience in this with my slightly older golflang Paradoc, which I had compiled into a WASM blob and put online and, just once, experienced the convenience of sharing a short text processing program through a link. (Puzzle: what does this program do?) I also wanted to write and run these programs while booted into a different operating system, using a different computer, or just on my phone.

<p>AFAIK Open AI has a powerful LLM system in large part due to large compute power.</p>
<p>Is there a future where small business / people can compete with mega-corps in the LLM space, or will we be renting GPT (or similar) until end the of time?</p>

<p>I've published an essay <a href="https://www.latentcenters.com/personification-of-computer-processes">Personification of computer processes</a> where I introduce a metaphor that will allow us to program computers in a game-like (and also in "<a href="https://dynamicland.org">Dynamic Land</a>"-like) environments. The website Latent Centers is a digital garden I started recently where I will continue to publish related work. The aim is to invent <a href="https://www.latentcenters.com">computing that makes us feel more alive</a>.</p>

<p>Now that I've started inserting coroutines into my apps (<a href="posts/future-of-coding-weekly-202311-week-2/?fromDate=2023-10-29&amp;toDate=2023-11-04&amp;channel=two-minute-week&amp;filter=#2023-11-01T06:07:08.191Z">💬 #two-minute-week</a>) to make them more debuggable, I'm starting to find and plug gaps in error recovery:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have to be careful to check the results of coroutine operations, because the underlying coroutine might have thrown an error.</li>
<li>Errors in Lua include a call stack, but errors within coroutines don't return the stack by default.</li>
<li>If I create a higher-order helper to abstract away the coroutine munging just to smear a computation across frames, does that impact the quality of debug information in the call stack? (Answer: no it doesn't in Lua, but it wasn't obvious.)</li>
<li>Call stacks returned by LÖVE aren't  <em>quite</em>  as clean as plain Lua.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've cleaned up the code for my debug infrastructure of <a href="posts/future-of-coding-weekly-202311-week-2/?fromDate=2023-10-29&amp;toDate=2023-11-04&amp;channel=two-minute-week&amp;filter=#2023-11-01T06:07:08.191Z">💬 #two-minute-week</a> and improved the error flow; now you get decent call stacks even if there's a coroutine in the middle somewhere.</p>

<p>What are some examples of successful UIs over constraint solving systems?</p>
<p>I'm about to do a bit of research on this topic but thought I'd start here.</p>
<p>Off the dome I can think of excel (numerical constraints) and rhino grasshopper (architectural / physical constraints).</p>
<p>I realize this is vague, but what I have in mind is a UI that allows for constraints to be defined which are then composed together and solved behind the scenes.</p>
<p>In particular, I'm wondering how to represent the case where there are multiple valid solutions and offer cycling through them to the user.</p>

<p>I'm thinking about ways to represent/interact with a (computational) graph. I could come up with three different interfaces off the top of my head: 1) names/identifiers and application, 2) combinators/stack operations, and 3) boxes and wires. I'm curious to know if y'all can think of any other?</p>

<p>I’m developing a cutting-edge tool that leverages ChatGPT to ghost-write prose based on my point-form outlines, particularly focusing on ‘new ideas’ that the AI wasn’t trained on. The challenge lies in preventing hallucinations and incorrect extrapolations from the outline. Early experimental results have been promising prompting me to create a dedicated workflow tool. This tool enables me to swiftly input point-form outlines, using the user-friendly Kinopio platform for brainstorming. I then paste the outline to ChatGPT, transforming it into coherent and readable prose. Join me in revolutionizing idea development and content creation with this innovative solution! [ChatGPT]</p>

<p>Hi, the last month I've been focussing a lot on fixing some bugs in the way nodes are connected and improving the different path types that are used.</p>
<p>This small demo video <a href="https://youtu.be/cnD-AlDQJDk">(Creating new flow using a "back-loop" and placing the "back-loop" connection on a separate layer)</a> shows creating a very small flow from scratch, the functionality of the flow is not important here.. but the thing I wanted to show is the way a "backloop" is created. The system uses a different svg path for backloops: normal nodes are connected using a bezier curve but when the output node is placed before the start node, the path changes to a "back-loop". </p>
<p>Another thing to notice is the layering.. the back-loop is placed on its own layer, hopefully keeping bigger flows more clear. You can toggle which layer is in front. </p>

<p>Hey folks! I'm doing some research into code formatters/pretty printers, with a view to potentially building my own. Does any one have any examples of code formatters that they've found especially fast, or that they know of which have a special focus on performance?</p>
<p>I'm interested in learning about some of the potential techniques at play - what sort of caching and parallelization is being done, are they doing incremental parsing like tree-sitter etc..</p>

<p>Over the years, I've thought about different ways of creating an interactive tutorial about writing a simple programming language. For example, you can create a "wizard" style with next and back buttons, or you can create one single page with the code floating on the right side of the content (possibly sticky). One detail is that each example would grow in size (for the complete code), but would only focus on one sub-section. I thought about collapsing sections already covered, but being able to expand them, or just have a single button to expand all the hidden code. Has anyone had experience or have seen articles that use a "build from small to large", showing code along the way?</p>

<p>Hey 🙂</p>
<p>I am looking for inspiration in building frontends with LLMs. I am looking for companies, which have LLMs (their own or wrappers around GPT) deployed in customer-facing applications (B2B and B2C) at some level of scale.</p>
<p>Something like Sudowrite and Jasper.</p>
<p>Also if you know some impressive solobuilders, feel free to name drop them 🙂</p>
<p>I would appreciate any link or name dropped in the thread 😉</p>

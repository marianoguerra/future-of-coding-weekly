<p>The subject of this episode’s paper — <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/propositions-as-types/propositions-as-types.pdf">Propositions as Types</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Wadler">Philip Wadler</a> — is one of those grand ideas that makes you want to go stargazing. To stare out into space and just disassociate from your body and become one with the heavens.  <em>Everything — life, space, time, existence — all of it is a joke!</em>  A cosmic ribbing delivered by the laws of the universe or some higher power or, perhaps, higher order. Humanity waited two thousand years, from the time of the ancient Greeks through until the 1930s, for a means to answer questions of calculability, when three suddenly arrived all at once:</p>
<ul>
<li>General recursive functions by Gödel in 1934, with functions of sets of natural numbers.</li>
<li>Lambda calculus by Alonzo Church in 1936, with anonymous single-variable functions.</li>
<li>Turing machines by Alan Turing in 1937, with a process for evaluating symbols on a tape.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then it was discovered that these three models of computation were, in fact, perfectly equivalent. That any statement made in one could be made in the others. A striking coincidence, sure, but not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_discovery">without precedent</a>. But  <em>then</em>  it was quietly determined (in 1934, again in 1969, and finally published in 1980) that computation itself is in a direct correspondence with logic. That every proposition in a given logic corresponds with a type in a given programming language, every proof corresponds with a program, and the simplification of the proof corresponds with the evaluation of the program.</p>
<p>The implications boggle the mind.  <em>How could this be so?</em>  Well, how could it be any other way? Why did it take so long to discover? What other discoveries like this are perched on the precipice of revelation?</p>
<p>Philip Wadler is here to walk us through this bit of history, suggest answers to some of these questions, and point us in a direction to search for more.</p>
<p>And  <em>we</em>  are here, dear listener, to level with you that a lot of this stuff is miserably hard to approach, presented with the symbols and language of formal logic that is so often inscrutable to outsiders. By walking you through Wadler’s paper (and the much more approachable <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOiZatlZtGU">Strange Loop talk</a>), and tying it in with the cultural context of modern functional programming, we hope you’ll gain an appreciation for this remarkable, divine  <em>pun</em>  that sits beneath all of computation.</p>

<p>I seem to have renewed my collaboration for a tablet-friendly programming environment. For the <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=94852">current version</a>, my partner led and pushed for preserving LÖVE primitives. For example, the LÖVE event loop calls functions you define called  <code>love.draw</code> ,  <code>love.keypressed</code> , etc., and it seems desirable to continue to support those for familiarity's sake. This can seem impossible if the environment is also built in LÖVE and uses those same functions for providing its infrastructure, but since Lua is a dynamic environment there are tricks to make it work reasonably nicely.</p>
<p>Lately I've been taking the lead on a riff of that project, and I find I'm advocating strongly to  <em>not</em>  do this. I want to define new handlers like  <code>shell.draw</code>  and  <code>shell.keypressed</code>  that programs within my environment will have to call. And I finally figured out why I feel so strongly about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>LÖVE has a function to return the bounds of the device/window. You typically can draw between x coordinates 0 and some width. And this information is often used to draw UI elements near the edges and corners. So should we now override functions like  <code>line</code>  to adjust coordinates and keep them in the client area? There's a lot of surface area to cover here. Bugs will inevitably happen, and when they do our attempts to create a seamless abstraction will cause more confusion.</li>
<li>Ranting more broadly, the desire for a "seamless experience" is a disease. The provider wants to "own the customer relationship," so that the user can forget there's anything in the universe but themselves and the app. Just like a casino. I'd rather not pretend we can wish the universe away with its possibility of errors. Let's me and the user treat each other as grown-ups, and not hide irreducible complexity in our supply chains. Here are the functions I provide, here are the functions LÖVE provides. I recommend you use my stuff where possible, but you don't have to. Yes, it's confusing. Welcome.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hi, since I've started building visual programming systems, I have always used a push-based approach where a node triggers another node that follows it. This is much inspired by flow based programming. But since I want to build a generic visual programming system, I think that it is also important to support different ways.. basic statecharts I already support, but a pull-based system is not yet something that I had build with my system. Until now! .. so in this video you can see how I construct a flow that is used to construct a glsl fragment shader. Here the output node pulls in the data from the node's cominh before it in the flow, so working backwards through a flow. </p>
<p>Although it's not my goal to build a full product around this alone.. a lot better and much more extensive applications already exist for building shaders this way. But still helpful to look at my project from a different perspective, which leads to some refactoring, bug fixing, insights and inspiration.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was really in doubt if this was the right route for this week's time spent on my project because of the awesome demo that tldraw made with gpt4-vision api, very cool! So,I also had to play with it together with my own application and was also amazed with the possibilities! Probably my next video will have this as a topic. Anyway, for now, enjoy my short video where I construct a very simple shader which runs on the GPU via webgl.</p>

<p><a href="http://akkartik.name/about">Kartik Agaram</a> It wasn’t on-topic in the thread you started a while back, my but first thought when considering building software like that is “Writing a social media app is frightening” (or more generally, “Storing user data is frightening”), as this post just reminded me: <a href="https://notes.billmill.org/link_blog/2023/11/Life-critical_side_projects.html">Life-critical side projects</a></p>

<p>I built a Magic Inky interface at work a while back. A metadata editor that presented as a nested bulleted list of English sentences with clickable words, like:</p>
<p>“From [time T1] to [time T2], an [event type] happens with [property P], and it’s very [adjective].”</p>
<p>The event descriptions are highly multi-dimensional and resonate well with this information design, though the timestamps suffer a bit. They want to be on a timeline, but I didn’t have the budget. Despite this, the UI has saved us loads of time and people  ~<em><em>love</em></em>~  the sentence-based configuration compared to the forty-column table of dropdowns they envisioned when I started the project.</p>
<p>The biggest failure was that enforcing a few global constraints was  ~<em><em>also</em></em>~  outside my budget. Lacking those has led to data loss—never more than a few minute’s worth, but still. I felt bad. Thankfully, someone else recently picked up the project and will be correcting those omissions.</p>
<p>But we disagreed immediately on how to do it! I thought we should  ~<em><em>present</em></em>~  the errors: “These events overlap!” The other person thought we should make the errors impossible: when you edit a timestamp, you implicitly edit all the others that are involved in the constraint.</p>
<p>I generally agree with their approach. I mean, it’s baked into the rest of the UI. When you change an event type, it changes the rest of the sentence. But if you change the type back, the sentence structure is restored and your previous values all come back. Cascading edits are more destructive than that. They force you to be careful about what you change and to be observant of unintended side-effects.</p>
<p>The block editor problem of representing invalid states is another way to look at it. Sometimes the most efficient path between two valid states passes through an invalid one. If you want to reorder two events, for example, a first step might be to copy the start and end times from one to the other, as part of an “a = b; b = oldA” sequence. They overlap until you’re done. To do the same without ever breaking global constraints requires user ingenuity or a more featureful editor with a “swap events” button. Requiring user ingenuity wastes a lot of time and energy and happiness over the lifetime of the UI, but observing users and adding features to address every desired editing operation takes a lot of dev time too, and it has to happen  ~<em><em>now</em></em>~ , or else people editing this data will be blocked whenever they find an impossible edit.</p>
<p>Anyway, not too many answers here, but I thought it was an interesting case study, with thought-provoking  ~<em><em>questions</em></em>~  at least!</p>

<p>An idea is starting to form for me around prototype-based modeling being a good metaphor for programming effectively with LLMs. Essentially you can provide an example of a patttern/component/class/etc and have it return a version of it modified in specific ways, which can then be used as a prototype for future generations/instantiations.</p>
<p>A version of this idea can be seen <a href="https://twitter.com/mrmkrs/status/1725959207365583196">here with tldraw</a> where he generates the next more specific interface step off the previous one.</p>
<p>Another I'm kind of using this in my agent framework: <a href="https://github.com/sublayerapp/sublayer/blob/main/lib/sublayer/agents/generate_sublayer_agent_agent.rb">generate_sublayer_agent_agent.rb</a> where we generate new agents based off a simple agent template (and works surprisingly well).</p>
<p>I know Hofstatder digs into this concept in GEB and Steve Yegge calls it the <a href="https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/10/universal-design-pattern.html">Universal Design Pattern</a></p>
<p>Does this resonate with anyone here? Is anyone familiar with any other writing about prototype-based modeling/prototypal inheritance/etc for me to take this further?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.applevis.com/forum/app-development-programming/work-progress-vosh-third-party-screen-reader-macintosh">I’m excited to see where this 3rd party screen-reader for macOS goes.</a> On windows there are 2 first-in-class options available outside of the OS, JAWS and NVDA. On macOS there is only the system provided VoiceOver.</p>
<p>I think VoiceOver is a pretty solid competitor to NVDA, but, it is very very very opinionated, and makes some unusual choices. I think this has a knock on effect where, since VoiceOver is the easiest screen-reader for most web devs to reach for, a lot of implementations end up being hyper-focused on supporting VoiceOver’s specific flavor of handling the accessibility tree. Having more diversity in the space, I think could hopefully mitigate this. While this isn’t directly related to the future of coding as we normally talk about it here, I think projects like this are just the sort of thing that can help to shape things for years to come.</p>

<p>“shouldn’t this have been published a few months ago?” yeah, probably. I even considered submitting it to the AoC contest. time is a real beast.
The title is clickbait. I did not design and implement a programming language for the sole or even primary purpose of leaderboarding on Advent of Code. It just turned out that the programming language I was working on fit the task remarkably well.
I can’t name just a single reason I started work on my language, Noulith, back in July 2022, but I think the biggest one was even more absurdly niche: I solve and write a lot of puzzlehunts, and I wanted a better programming language to use to search word lists for words satisfying unusual constraints, such as, “Find all ten-letter words that contain each of the letters A, B, and C exactly once and that have the ninth letter K.”1 I have a folder of ten-line scripts of this kind, mostly Python, and I thought there was surely a better way to do this. Not necessarily faster — there is obviously no way I could save time on net by optimizing this process. But, for example, I wanted to be able to easily share these programs such that others could run them. I had a positive experience in this with my slightly older golflang Paradoc, which I had compiled into a WASM blob and put online and, just once, experienced the convenience of sharing a short text processing program through a link. (Puzzle: what does this program do?) I also wanted to write and run these programs while booted into a different operating system, using a different computer, or just on my phone.

<p>I don't know much about LLMs, so I'm purely asking out of ignorance.</p>
<p>AFAIK Open AI has a powerful LLM system in large part due to large compute power.</p>
<p>Is there a future where small business / people can compete with mega-corps in the LLM space, or will we be renting GPT (or similar) until end the of time?</p>

<p>I've published an essay <a href="https://www.latentcenters.com/personification-of-computer-processes">Personification of computer processes</a> where I introduce a metaphor that will allow us to program computers in a game-like (and also in "<a href="https://dynamicland.org">Dynamic Land</a>"-like) environments. The website Latent Centers is a digital garden I started recently where I will continue to publish related work. The aim is to invent <a href="https://www.latentcenters.com">computing that makes us feel more alive</a>.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!</p>

<p>Now that I've started inserting coroutines into my apps (<a href="posts/future-of-coding-weekly-202311-week-2/?fromDate=2023-10-29&amp;toDate=2023-11-04&amp;channel=two-minute-week&amp;filter=#2023-11-01T06:07:08.191Z">💬 #two-minute-week</a>) to make them more debuggable, I'm starting to find and plug gaps in error recovery:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have to be careful to check the results of coroutine operations, because the underlying coroutine might have thrown an error.</li>
<li>Errors in Lua include a call stack, but errors within coroutines don't return the stack by default.</li>
<li>If I create a higher-order helper to abstract away the coroutine munging just to smear a computation across frames, does that impact the quality of debug information in the call stack? (Answer: no it doesn't in Lua, but it wasn't obvious.)</li>
<li>Call stacks returned by LÖVE aren't  <em>quite</em>  as clean as plain Lua.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've cleaned up the code for my debug infrastructure of <a href="posts/future-of-coding-weekly-202311-week-2/?fromDate=2023-10-29&amp;toDate=2023-11-04&amp;channel=two-minute-week&amp;filter=#2023-11-01T06:07:08.191Z">💬 #two-minute-week</a> and improved the error flow; now you get decent call stacks even if there's a coroutine in the middle somewhere.</p>
<p>The debug infrastructure lives on the surface. I frequently tinker with it while debugging.</p>

<p>What are some examples of successful UIs over constraint solving systems?</p>
<p>I'm about to do a bit of research on this topic but thought I'd start here.</p>
<p>Off the dome I can think of excel (numerical constraints) and rhino grasshopper (architectural / physical constraints).</p>
<p>I realize this is vague, but what I have in mind is a UI that allows for constraints to be defined which are then composed together and solved behind the scenes.</p>
<p>In particular, I'm wondering how to represent the case where there are multiple valid solutions and offer cycling through them to the user.</p>

<p>I'm thinking about ways to represent/interact with a (computational) graph. I could come up with three different interfaces off the top of my head: 1) names/identifiers and application, 2) combinators/stack operations, and 3) boxes and wires. I'm curious to know if y'all can think of any other?</p>

<p>It's a beautifully animated film by Felix Colgrave titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhVehcHwOB8">Throat Notes</a>.

<p>Hey everyone -- long-time lurker, first time poster. Thrilled to share the open beta launch of MightyMeld, a visual dev tool for React I've been building with some friends of mine. <a href="https://www.mightymeld.com/">mightymeld.com</a></p>

<p>Would love to hear your thoughts! I'm a former academic who's been driven into industry out of a desire to make the theoretical practical. MightyMeld is a "visual coding" that is not like any kind of "visual coding" i would've imagined if we hadn't've built this thing starting from real production code and saying "how can we make this more visual".</p>

<p>I’m developing a cutting-edge tool that leverages ChatGPT to ghost-write prose based on my point-form outlines, particularly focusing on ‘new ideas’ that the AI wasn’t trained on. The challenge lies in preventing hallucinations and incorrect extrapolations from the outline. Early experimental results have been promising prompting me to create a dedicated workflow tool. This tool enables me to swiftly input point-form outlines, using the user-friendly Kinopio platform for brainstorming. I then paste the outline to ChatGPT, transforming it into coherent and readable prose. Join me in revolutionizing idea development and content creation with this innovative solution! [ChatGPT]</p>

<p>Hi, the last month I've been focussing a lot on fixing some bugs in the way nodes are connected and improving the different path types that are used.</p>
<p>This small demo video <a href="https://youtu.be/cnD-AlDQJDk">(Creating new flow using a "back-loop" and placing the "back-loop" connection on a separate layer)</a> shows creating a very small flow from scratch, the functionality of the flow is not important here.. but the thing I wanted to show is the way a "backloop" is created. The system uses a different svg path for backloops: normal nodes are connected using a bezier curve but when the output node is placed before the start node, the path changes to a "back-loop". </p>
<p>Another thing to notice is the layering.. the back-loop is placed on its own layer, hopefully keeping bigger flows more clear. You can toggle which layer is in front. </p>

<p>Hey folks! I'm doing some research into code formatters/pretty printers, with a view to potentially building my own. Does any one have any examples of code formatters that they've found especially fast, or that they know of which have a special focus on performance?</p>
<p>I'm interested in learning about some of the potential techniques at play - what sort of caching and parallelization is being done, are they doing incremental parsing like tree-sitter etc..</p>

<p>Over the years, I've thought about different ways of creating an interactive tutorial about writing a simple programming language. For example, you can create a "wizard" style with next and back buttons, or you can create one single page with the code floating on the right side of the content (possibly sticky). One detail is that each example would grow in size (for the complete code), but would only focus on one sub-section. I thought about collapsing sections already covered, but being able to expand them, or just have a single button to expand all the hidden code. Has anyone had experience or have seen articles that use a "build from small to large", showing code along the way?</p>

<p>I’ve been working on a tool to get a high level view of an entire typescript codebase to help me understand/navigate it.</p>
<p>It shows all the functions and interfaces. Every  <code>interface</code>  is represented by a color, and the signature of a function is shown with these colors.</p>
<p>I need some help with a better algorithm to transform the name of the  <code>type</code>  into to a color. e.g. the type  <code>string</code>  -&gt; blue,  <code>int</code>  -&gt; green, etc.</p>
<p>The problem is that I’m not sure what I want the output to be, how should the color space be distributed? how should colors be clustered?</p>
<p>I think I can copy what code editors use for  <code>semantic highlighting</code> , but I haven’t been able to find an implementation of it.</p>
<p>Does anyone have ideas on what I should search for?</p>
<p>Happy to explain more, if it’s not clear.</p>
<p>PS. Here is how a codebase currently looks. White rectangles are files, interfaces are shown on the top, and functions on the bottom</p>

I spontaneously decided to project your example to an ALD mockup to get a bit of a feeling for inhowfar ALDs are compatible with your code projection focused of concatenative code.
Seems pretty good.</p>
<p>★ One nice thing with ALDs is that library functions are threated exactly the same as argument values. They come in as semi-implicit arguments via the grey collection abstraction-line.
★ One annoying (but I think good) restriction of ALD is that functions (and definitions in let sections) can only ever have just one single value-line as their final output (except one cheats a bit as I've done here with memocurry :smiling_imp:).</p>

<p><em>Replacing authentication with visual identity</em> </p>
<p>Background: I'm starting to think about building a new forum. Given <a href="https://akkartik.name/freewheeling/">my past</a>, it won't surprise anyone that I mean to do this outside the morass of non-convivial software that is the modern web browser. My broad plan is:</p>
<ul>
<li>LÖVE v12 will support https, and <a href="https://github.com/love2d/love/actions">release candidates</a> are already quite stable. Good enough to start building on.</li>
<li>I'll build my forum out of a server-side API in Lua and a client in LÖVE v12. (Should be easy to support Windows, Linux, BSD and Android. Mac and iOS will require some annual contortions to build LÖVE for oneself.)</li>
<li>The server side will of course be open source just like the client. In addition, all post/comment data will be published to a git repo on something like a daily basis.</li>
</ul>
<p>The one major open question concerns authentication. How can we have stable identity? The above architecture is intended to allow anyone to host the forum (without trying to build galaxy-brain merkle trees, federated protocols or CRDTs), and I would prefer to not take a position of power as the source of everyone's hashed passwords (an intrinsically centralizing architecture).</p>
<p>A few months ago someone showed me this ancient essay called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091126092028/http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2009/3/12/33338/3000">"attacked from within"</a>, and I find myself thinking about it often. The whole thing is worth reading, but for this thread the crucial list of bullets halfway down is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Registration keeps out good posters.</li>
<li>Registration lets in bad posters.</li>
<li>Registration attracts trolls.</li>
<li>Anonymity counters vanity.</li>
</ul>
<p>A provocative worldview that seems at least worth exploring. Keeping this in mind, I have a hazy idea that looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you run the client you get to choose your handle, but it's not unique (cf. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle">Zooko's Triangle</a>)</li>
<li>When you run the client for the first time, it creates an RSA keypair for you.</li>
<li>When composing messages, the client signs the message with your private key (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#Signing_messages">description on Wikipedia</a>)</li>
<li>When rendering messages, the client validates the signature against your public key and shows something like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identicon">identicon</a> of the public key.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implications of this setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>No registration</li>
<li>Your "password" (private key) never leaves your device(s).</li>
<li>When reading a thread you see a handle like  <code>spiralganglion</code> . However, the handle is not authoritative. Next to it is an identicon that is authoritative.</li>
<li>It's easy in a thread to see if there are ever two people with the same handle but different identicons.</li>
<li>Since the client platform is starting from scratch, accessibility and internationalization will be a challenge for a long time 😕</li>
</ul>
<p>No guarantees this is all doable. It's quite possible the cryptographic operations will be untenably slow when implemented in Lua, and a native library for them would complicate the simple install story that is LÖVE's greatest strength.</p>
<p>But I'm curious to get people's thoughts on this idea in principle.</p>

<p>Maybe more of a general coding question but how do you y’all feel about database/stores that add fields to your documents that insert?</p>
<p>E.g. you insert  <code>{ name: 'Titanic', director: 'James Cameron' }</code>  into  <code>movies</code>  and when you fetch it you get back  <code>{_id: 1234, _col: 'movies', name: 'Titanic', director: 'James Cameron' }</code> </p>
<p>Does that bug you? Don’t care?</p>
<p>Are there any ways to get around this so there aren’t won’t ever have collections between user defined fields and internal metadata?</p>

<p>One of the things I am curious about is how a11y relates to the future of coding. So far it doesn't seem to come up in the discussions on the podcast but I think there is something to be said about the advancement in a11y in computing over the last 25 years and a large part of this is due to a movement away from some of the more creative interface designs (ala Magic Ink). Is there a future of code that is more accessible to people with different abilities?</p>

<p>In the past year or 2, I got interested in OO and I find even its basic form within a mainstream language very powerful.</p>
<p>Yet, when I try to advocate for using polymorphism in almost any context, I get "this is too unfamiliar"/"that's not how we do things in framework X" instead advocating for switch statements or similar.</p>
<p>And it really gets me thinking, if we don't even understand OO after 30 years of mainstream adoption (in some form or another) and are still doing "structured programming" with lambdas &amp; objects, is generic code just hopeless in practice? Is there an education problem? Is it just indicative of how poor standards are that few people have the privilege to do any amount of design for their systems before developing?</p>
<p>If so, how does "future of coding" even matter if any form of real adoption feels impossible.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>(Making a new thread about this because the other one has become about OO instead of this bit)</p>
<p>I feel this deeply. It can often feel as if things don't get adopted. That programming doesn't change for the better. I have so many thoughts on this, it is hard to summarize.</p>
<p>First, I do think we can get others to adopt the things we value. It is almost never an education issue, imo and instead a value question. (I am intentionally leaving aside the OO frame here). Think about the impact that Rich Hickey has had on how many people code, not just clojure people, but in the industry broadly. How did he do it? Through Simple Made Easy, a talk largely about values, not techniques. The same is true of Bret Victor's influence on the future of coding community. He communicated values that others adopted.</p>
<p>I've found this to be true in practice as well. Trying to convince people to change their coding style requires diligence, communicating values, and showing how code improves because of these values. Conflict often happens when people implicitly hold very different values. I'm going to bet that is the case in the original example given.</p>
<p>But I also want to step back and ask, what kind of adoption, by who, by how many people? I'm willing to bet a lot of people in this slack listen to some genre of music that isn't completely mainstream. Have those genres failed because of the lack of becoming mainstream? Would they be better if they became mainstream?</p>

<p>What do people here think about the REBL (read-eval-browse-loop) and the ‘Data Rabbit’ project which evolved from it?</p>
<p>Both are tools originating in Clojure, but where the REBL is about mixing writing/running Clojure with having a graphical interface to drill down into the output data (e.g. a natural ‘visual programming’ evolution of a REPL),</p>
<p>I’d describe Data Rabbit as the opposite: A data inspection/‘dashboard creation’ tool where you can do most tasks visually, only dropping down to Clojure if you want to do really custom things (or create new types of ‘blocks’/interactions).</p>

<p>And in not totally unrelated fashion, there’s PureData (FOSS) / Cycling76' Max (paid), which are reasonably successful graph-based programming languages for digital music synthesizers.</p>
<p>I expect that in that particular case graph-based programming is so successful because it is a direct translation of how (analog) modular synthesizers used to be patched together, flattening the learning curve for musicians.</p>

<p>Hey everyone! 👋 I’m a student who’s been working on a side project to explore how LLMs may augment creative problem solving.</p>
<p>I’ve synthesised everything into a rough concept I would love to hear your perspectives on:</p>
<p>~<em><em>Here is a quick demo:</em></em>~  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDRg5WgSrm0"> A tool to augment creative problem-solving. </a></p>
<p>Initial inspirations include Jef Raskin’s “Archy”, Mozilla’s old “Ubiquity” project, the thinking of Vannevar Bush, and recent tools like “mymind”. There are still many ideas and user experience concerns to be properly fleshed out, but hopefully it’s an interesting direction.</p>

<p>I had helped build <a href="https://codeberg.org/nilesh/grapher">this tool</a> to create civilizational tech trees so that resources (like talent and funds) can be directed where they are most impactful.</p>

<p>I built a little voice recorder in Lua Carousel last night</p>
<p>One little detail here involves Android permissions. I almost ended up asking for microphone permissions in Lua Carousel. Luckily I managed to stop and ask myself what the user experience is. "Hi, I'm Lua Carousel, could I please have access to your mic?" Ick! It seems like a bad idea to ask for a permission for the whole app just in case some single script uses it. Probably affects the conversions from this particular blog post, but I don't want to feel like I'm contributing to the general fatigue over apps asking for permissions. 🤷</p>

<p>aside: The whole issue of passwords and permissions is a  <em>huge</em>  UX issue that deserves a long discussion on of-end-user-programming.  Users should be allowed to  <em>just use</em>  a device without being forced to answer a bunch of questions about technical issues and needing to keep a bowl full of anti-anxiety meds nearby.  Imagine if my refrigerator required me to perform some ritual before allowing me to put my recently-bought lettuce into the crisper.</p>

<p>I've been enjoying the "<a href="https://www.tadiweb.com">tadi web</a>" approach Lu has been espousing lately. I also had some nice discussions at Strange Loop with Devine and a few others about minimizing friction / dependencies / build steps, both broadly but also specifically pertaining to publishing one's personal site. So in this spirit, I've been reworking my personal site a bit. I plan to finally add RSS and, even though it goes against the spirit of Lu and Devine's approaches, add a more complex build process that enables some functionality I've long wanted.</p>

<p>I was exploring a domain outside programming today and thought "gee, I wonder if somebody has written a detailed end-to-end case study about this?' Then, I wondered, "gee, has anybody written a detailed end-to-end case study about a software project?"</p>
<p>I always think of software as a very open and sharing community, where we talk about our work and learn from each other without too much secrecy. But I struggled to think of examples. Of course, we seem to be constantly publishing tiny, focused case studies as blog posts. And this is incredible and valuable. But my curiosity is now piqued about this other thing.</p>

<p>Hey all! All abuzz that I’ve finally pushed the alpha version up of my Metal-based 3D code visualizer apps. After many months, I’ve finally gotten in my place:</p>
<ul>
<li>A brand new and extremely amateurish Metal rendering “engine” focused primarily on character glyphs.</li>
<li>An, “is this a joke?” UTF8-&gt;UTF32-&gt;UnicodeGraphemeCluster GPU based text parser and basic layout engine.</li>
<li>Download GitHub repositories in-app and view arbitrary textual files.</li>
<li>Reset your atlas if you stumble into new languages online 🤓</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve got an iPhone, iPad, or Mac device, I’d be happy to invite ya to the TestFlight to give the app a whirl where you’d like. Desktop builds and releases coming upon next coffee intake ritual.</p>

<p>I've been working for Unison for the last three years. I got hired start and head up the Unison Cloud project, which today we are starting to open up to early adopters: <a href="https://www.unison.cloud/">unison.cloud</a> The idea is that we want to make it as easy as possible to go from some function from  <code>HttpRequest -&gt; HttpServer</code>  to a deployed service, but we also want to give a rich and modern distributed programming interface to that function.   Hit me up if you want to get access to the Beta!</p>

<li>explore idea of <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/">local first software</a> but in a different way. what is cool with this approach that data lives locally on your devices and then I just sync it to the web where it can be viewed and used by everyone</li>

<p>I heard that day-5 part two was a curveball, so I really want to be able to implement it using my visual programming system... which failed so far. Using a brute force solution would mean that the program would run very very long. And my current "speed run" solution wouldn't suffice for this. </p>
<p>Part one actually provided a big challenge for my vps as well, running the program with the small test dataset can be seen in the video: <a href="https://youtu.be/td0QeePvfGQ">youtu.be/td0QeePvfGQ</a> . I've spend a lot of time adding more new node-types this weekend (like handling a while-loop and improved array handling) and making changes to the variable-nodes and expressions. Also the variable scoping (needed for local function variables) that I implemented had some flaws, so I fixed that as well. You can now define global and scoped variables. I've also made some simple variable visualizers that better show the data for data types like dictionary/array and grid. </p>
<p>My current vps solution works better than the flow-based vps that I was building last year. A big difference is that the data that is send from node to node is now just a single value. That value can still be of different types (number, string, array).. and special variable-nodes are needed to keep track of data. These variables also have a type like number, string, array, dictionary, grid. Often working with a single value is not enough and that's why these variables are needed. They can be referenced from within expressions. Also being able to run some flow-parts in parallel or sequentially helps a lot. This starts to feel much more like a regular 3rd gen programming language. </p>
<p>The UI is currently quite limited.. to be able to create a flow program efficiently it definitely needs a lot of work. Textual programming is much faster. I want to finish at least one of the advent of code puzzles where a grid is involved .. so today's puzzle (17) seems like a good fit. I'll probably work on that next weekend.</p>

<p>One nice reusable abstraction my LÖVE apps have all converged on is an immediate-mode button primitive. I draw all my buttons each frame along with all the callbacks they need, and a couple of framework-y lines of code in the mouse-press callback is all it takes to get them working. Last night I realized (while poking inside <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=236661&amp;sid=2693d6bb97fdec2945964df8ab60a34a#p236661">Re: Conway's game of life</a>) that my hacky sliders in Lua Carousel's settings admit a similar abstraction (even better than the one there). The only additional complexity is it needs a couple more lines in the  <code>update</code>  callback that continually refresh the backing value as you drag the slider.</p>

<p>Finally starting to see a workflow come together in my editor. Here you can see Fibonacci at three different levels in the language I'm making. These functions live in three different files. Looking at them at once and comparing them isn't easily supported in any other editor I use. On the left is a simplistic symbol browser.</p>
<p>I'm super excited that I'm slowly getting to the point where I can do these kinds of things. Having different views of our codebases that we can switch between is something I've been wanting for years.</p>

<p>I'm making a system for working with loosely structured tables in spreadsheets. Tables/lists in sheets represent collections of things, however formulas and drag-filling works at an item-level (cell-level) abstraction. This causes a lot of problems – duplicated effort, hard to do lookups across tables, errors when new data is added. However, committing to a structure upfront (a SQL style table for example) has a big cost. An effective system would allow users to gradually introduce structure that works with whatever rich table they draw.</p>
<p>Right now I'm onto a language for pulling data from such rich tables. It works by manipulation of the ranges (rectangles) pointed to by Labels. Queries can be made by intersecting/unioning rectangles (in picture is a small example). What ideas/projects would you recommend looking at in this space? I've looked around a fair bit for "2D grammar" and "spatial programming language" but haven't had much luck.</p>

<p>Today, is there a way to build state-driven UI components (like React/Vue/Svelte) where some of the state, but not all, can be persisted periodically in the backend perhaps as an event log which would enable things like playback of past interactions? How would you go about creating something like this with usual tools like Javascript, REST and Postgresql? 🤔</p>

<p>Oh boy.. it was a lot of work being able to solve advent of code puzzle 7 (part 1) in my visual programming system.. as you can see in the video <a href="https://youtu.be/kkgJQdJXFtk">youtu.be/kkgJQdJXFtk</a>. I had to implement a lot new node-types for handling dictionaries and a new scoped-variable type. This scoped-variable can have different types.. currently just a regular value or a dictionary. This dictionary is used in a function-flow to determine the hand type which is needed in this puzzle. Also custom sorting was needed (I implemented a Schwartzian transform in the sort node-type). Running the flow for the full puzzle input takes a long time so I don't show that in the video (although I've added a "full-speed" mode that helps a bit). I've also added some colors to better show when some nodes are active, especially handy for nodes that run longer like a foreach, function-call, map or sort.</p>

<p>What if web frameworks offered a standard way to discover capabilities that are then given to AI as tools? A  <code>document.getTools()</code>  perhaps?</p>
<p>This could be achieved simply with plugins for NextJS, VueJS, SvelteKit etc. Small convention that eliminates a lot of brittleness when web agents try to discover capabilities and invoke them.</p>

<p>Hi all, I've been inactive here for a long time. Progress on my big project, a collaborative mobile-friendly development environment, has been very slow. However, along the way I've built some libraries which may be of interest to some people here.</p>
<p>On the languages and parsing side, I've built <a href="https://github.com/jhp/recursive-grammar-literal">recursive grammar literals</a> which lets you write CFGs as normal javascript functions. And <a href="https://github.com/jhp/church-cat">church-cat</a> which lets you compute over a tree structure, e.g. annotate a parse tree.</p>
<p>On the UI side I've built <a href="https://github.com/jhp/imperative">imperative</a> which is a frontend javascript library much like React, but based on generators and structured concurrency. And most recently I've been working on <a href="https://github.com/jhp/palimpsest">Palimpsest</a> which covers the backend of web development with a more functional or "event-sourced" style where data sources are computed as folds over input streams. My interest there is to allow stateful applications to be more easily shared, forked, and extended by their users etc.</p>

<p>We just published a new demo of Plato's PBD subsystem. Much more powerful than our previous implementation.</p>
<p>PBD is historically difficult to generalize and make practical, but it seems that once you take it out of the desktop metaphor and apply it to relational data where queries are more explicit, it does quite well.</p>
<p>I suspect this could become the most prevalent way of automating app logic without coding.</p>

<p>Hi All</p>
<p>I’m almost “done” with my VR visual/spatial programming app, Pebble Graphics 🎉 (“done” because I still see a lot of things that could be improved, but there are other projects I’m excited to start so I’m shipping what I have). It’s a VR version of turtle graphics with some interactive program stepping and 3D visualizations of things like state change and execution history.</p>
<p>I made a trailer you can watch (and listen to 🎶) here <a href="https://youtu.be/Fl3DjzTdUo8?si=bWi7CWwbXIQh_wUw">Pebble Graphics Trailer</a>. If you have a Quest headset and want to try it out, I set up a Beta release while I try to get it into Meta’s App Lab app store. This link <a href="https://www.meta.com/s/2Rlda8ess">meta.com/s/2Rlda8ess</a> should work otherwise feel free to DM me the email address associated with your Oculus/Meta account.</p>
<p>I also have some time-stamped/annotated videos later on in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhmEEtPzG7mW4JrBUhwbo3al6HjaJsDp2">Youtube Playlist</a> in case you want to see more.</p>
<p>I’m more of a lurker in this slack, but it’s a community I enjoy checking on and it’s really cool to see it grow!</p>

<p>Pebble Graphics is a 3D visual and interactive programming system that lets you create and explore geometric patterns in virtual reality. Using simple commands, you can control Pebbles the dog to draw lines and shapes with programming. You can also step through your programs interactively, and see unique 3D visualizations of how things change over time. Pebble Graphics is a fun and creative way to learn basic ideas in programming.</p>

<p>Last year I used the advent of code to test the visual programming environment that I was building at that time.. and it helped me to come to the conclusion to start over.. which I did at the beginning of this year. So... the time has come to test my new environment and let advent of code help me improve and extend it. Hopefully this year I won't need to decide to start over😅. To finish the first challenge I needed to extend my vps with new node types or tweak some other stuff like be able to execute regex expressions and load external files as input to a flow. For the second part of day 1 a special node needed to be created to handle the sneaky replace string functionality that was needed. A very nice update that I made is the possibility to run parts of flow in parallel instead of sequential and use the results in the upstream nodes. </p>
<p>And talking about upstream nodes... since last week it's also possible to drag all upstream or downstream nodes at once when reorganizing a flow using UI elements(it can be seen in the video). </p>
<p>In the flow-engine I also use standalone nodes that represent global variables which can be used in other nodes. </p>
<p>I'll definitely not make it to the AoC leaderboard (it's not a goal anyway).. however.. I think I am getting a lot of value out of this already..even on day 1.</p>

<p>Been making slow, but steady progress on my editor. I can properly zoom in and out on the canvas. I can have some panes that represent sub-file things. The power usage when idle is basically non-existent (down from 100% cpu usage always). I finally feel like things are starting to come together and that I can finish up some parts and then really start focusing on actually making the flow and features fit how I code.</p>
<p>Hopefully soon I can start using it for a project that isn't coding itself so I am forced to add all the features I've been ignoring.</p>

<p>Context:  the most interesting stuff done on text always happened on emacs, and it makes sense to use a text centric malleable software platform to experiment by adding LLMs to everything, I haven't seen much done there.</p>

<p>I've demoed my Kopi language and Rect-Desktop projects a few weeks ago. In my experience writing Kopi, I've always wanted to write a "How to Write a Programming Language" tutorial based on it, since the core language is simple and familiar (infix operators, assignment, anonymous functions, etc.). Here's the start of something (written in Markdown, presented using the React-Desktop Markdown app:</p>

<p>Followup on my  <code>~_*Colorful types*_~</code>  project. I’m trying to create a  <code>~_*map*_~</code>  for a codebase with different zoom levels.</p>
<p>I have been thinking about having 3 zoom levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1: Only colors for both types &amp; functions</li>
<li>Level 2: Colors and names for types, functions and parameters</li>
<li>Level 3: Shows the entire source file (maybe with some extra color sugar on top?) </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a couple of screenshots of level 1 &amp; 2, and video of the WIP interface.</p>
<p>PS. Anyone have good recommendations of typescript codebases with a couple dozen source code files which I can use for testing?</p>

<p>More progress on a lightweight programming environment that runs on Linux, Windows, Mac, Android, iOS. Also modifiable live while it runs (though not on mobile devices).</p>
<p>The seed design constraint here was to structurally prevent the pop-up keyboard on a touchscreen from ever blocking my typing. That led to this design of a multi-line commandline editor in the top half, fixing the non-editable output buffer in the bottom half. Independent commands/scripts then expanded in the only other direction available: left/right.</p>

<p>Hi, in this weeks video I show a new node type in which a prompt can be entered which is used to create HTML via openai gpt4. It's quite powerful .. the created nodes can receive and visualize input data from another node. This is offcourse inspired by makeitreal from tldraw which uses gpt4-vision-preview. I have been playing with the prompt to get the result that I wanted, although the results are not consistent when recreating the html using the same prompt. Still, very cool that this is possible.</p>

<p>Achievement unlocked: I've built an app large enough[1] that it crashes my programming environment that puts all the code on a spatial surface.</p>
<p>The problem: I do this snazzy initial animation (see video) that takes in the whole thing before zooming back in somewhere. That animation works by drawing the whole surface to an in-memory canvas before transforming it. Turns out drawing to a canvas still uses the video card, and I don't have enough video RAM for a virtual "monitor" of this resolution.</p>
<p>[1] Or spread out enough. It's not really about lines of code, just how much area the code occupies.</p>

<p>I was leafing through my father's old books when this diagram caught me off-guard.</p>
<p>We're so used now to having an OS with apps, that it's weird to think of OS-level transitions (login-&gt;shell), inter-apps transitions (shell-&gt;vi) and inside-app transitions (vi's command&lt;-&gt;append modes) as similar things. 🙃</p>
<p>But to a user new to computers, yes these are all "modes".</p>

<p>I think that often the most difficult part of programming is debugging: humans aren't very good at "seeing" how an app operated when it failed. You get some log output that might or might not have references to the correct file locations.</p>
<p>I don't see any reason, in the long term, why humans would be better than machines at debugging. How to make that happen? I assume somebody is building this already. Would it help if an AI with a large context window + access to the VM could see the whole call logs/tree and see exactly what is going on?  AI could learn from other users, see everything that happens in a run without debugger/console.logs, try multiple solutions in parallel, and fix issues while you sleep.</p>
<p>Thoughts on this?</p>

<p>Ink &amp; Switch just released a new essay: <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/embark/">Embark — Dynamic documents for making plans</a>.</p>
<p>Starting from a desire to "unbundle the app" in the name of malleable software, they explore using a bullet-point outliner as a substrate for dynamic properties, computations, and views. They ground the work with a specific use case — trip planning — and they hard-code a bunch of stuff that ought to be pushed into user space, granted. But it's easy to look at this, imagine how it could be expanded, and see some really compelling possibilities for a different way to approach creating and distributing software.</p>

<p>The subject of this episode’s paper — <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/propositions-as-types/propositions-as-types.pdf">Propositions as Types</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Wadler">Philip Wadler</a> — is one of those grand ideas that makes you want to go stargazing. To stare out into space and just disassociate from your body and become one with the heavens.  <em>Everything — life, space, time, existence — all of it is a joke!</em>  A cosmic ribbing delivered by the laws of the universe or some higher power or, perhaps, higher order. Humanity waited two thousand years, from the time of the ancient Greeks through until the 1930s, for a means to answer questions of calculability, when three suddenly arrived all at once:</p>
<ul>
<li>General recursive functions by Gödel in 1934, with functions of sets of natural numbers.</li>
<li>Lambda calculus by Alonzo Church in 1936, with anonymous single-variable functions.</li>
<li>Turing machines by Alan Turing in 1937, with a process for evaluating symbols on a tape.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then it was discovered that these three models of computation were, in fact, perfectly equivalent. That any statement made in one could be made in the others. A striking coincidence, sure, but not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_discovery">without precedent</a>. But  <em>then</em>  it was quietly determined (in 1934, again in 1969, and finally published in 1980) that computation itself is in a direct correspondence with logic. That every proposition in a given logic corresponds with a type in a given programming language, every proof corresponds with a program, and the simplification of the proof corresponds with the evaluation of the program.</p>
<p>The implications boggle the mind.  <em>How could this be so?</em>  Well, how could it be any other way? Why did it take so long to discover? What other discoveries like this are perched on the precipice of revelation?</p>
<p>Philip Wadler is here to walk us through this bit of history, suggest answers to some of these questions, and point us in a direction to search for more.</p>
<p>And  <em>we</em>  are here, dear listener, to level with you that a lot of this stuff is miserably hard to approach, presented with the symbols and language of formal logic that is so often inscrutable to outsiders. By walking you through Wadler’s paper (and the much more approachable <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOiZatlZtGU">Strange Loop talk</a>), and tying it in with the cultural context of modern functional programming, we hope you’ll gain an appreciation for this remarkable, divine  <em>pun</em>  that sits beneath all of computation.</p>

<p>I seem to have renewed my collaboration for a tablet-friendly programming environment. For the <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=94852">current version</a>, my partner led and pushed for preserving LÖVE primitives. For example, the LÖVE event loop calls functions you define called  <code>love.draw</code> ,  <code>love.keypressed</code> , etc., and it seems desirable to continue to support those for familiarity's sake. This can seem impossible if the environment is also built in LÖVE and uses those same functions for providing its infrastructure, but since Lua is a dynamic environment there are tricks to make it work reasonably nicely.</p>
<p>Lately I've been taking the lead on a riff of that project, and I find I'm advocating strongly to  <em>not</em>  do this. I want to define new handlers like  <code>shell.draw</code>  and  <code>shell.keypressed</code>  that programs within my environment will have to call. And I finally figured out why I feel so strongly about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>LÖVE has a function to return the bounds of the device/window. You typically can draw between x coordinates 0 and some width. And this information is often used to draw UI elements near the edges and corners. So should we now override functions like  <code>line</code>  to adjust coordinates and keep them in the client area? There's a lot of surface area to cover here. Bugs will inevitably happen, and when they do our attempts to create a seamless abstraction will cause more confusion.</li>
<li>Ranting more broadly, the desire for a "seamless experience" is a disease. The provider wants to "own the customer relationship," so that the user can forget there's anything in the universe but themselves and the app. Just like a casino. I'd rather not pretend we can wish the universe away with its possibility of errors. Let's me and the user treat each other as grown-ups, and not hide irreducible complexity in our supply chains. Here are the functions I provide, here are the functions LÖVE provides. I recommend you use my stuff where possible, but you don't have to. Yes, it's confusing. Welcome.</li>

<p>Hi, since I've started building visual programming systems, I have always used a push-based approach where a node triggers another node that follows it. This is much inspired by flow based programming. But since I want to build a generic visual programming system, I think that it is also important to support different ways.. basic statecharts I already support, but a pull-based system is not yet something that I had build with my system. Until now! .. so in this video you can see how I construct a flow that is used to construct a glsl fragment shader. Here the output node pulls in the data from the node's cominh before it in the flow, so working backwards through a flow. </p>
<p>Although it's not my goal to build a full product around this alone.. a lot better and much more extensive applications already exist for building shaders this way. But still helpful to look at my project from a different perspective, which leads to some refactoring, bug fixing, insights and inspiration.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was really in doubt if this was the right route for this week's time spent on my project because of the awesome demo that tldraw made with gpt4-vision api, very cool! So,I also had to play with it together with my own application and was also amazed with the possibilities! Probably my next video will have this as a topic. Anyway, for now, enjoy my short video where I construct a very simple shader which runs on the GPU via webgl.</p>

<p><a href="http://akkartik.name/about">Kartik Agaram</a> It wasn’t on-topic in the thread you started a while back, my but first thought when considering building software like that is “Writing a social media app is frightening” (or more generally, “Storing user data is frightening”), as this post just reminded me: <a href="https://notes.billmill.org/link_blog/2023/11/Life-critical_side_projects.html">Life-critical side projects</a></p>

<p>I built a Magic Inky interface at work a while back. A metadata editor that presented as a nested bulleted list of English sentences with clickable words, like:</p>
<p>“From [time T1] to [time T2], an [event type] happens with [property P], and it’s very [adjective].”</p>
<p>The event descriptions are highly multi-dimensional and resonate well with this information design, though the timestamps suffer a bit. They want to be on a timeline, but I didn’t have the budget. Despite this, the UI has saved us loads of time and people  ~<em><em>love</em></em>~  the sentence-based configuration compared to the forty-column table of dropdowns they envisioned when I started the project.</p>
<p>The biggest failure was that enforcing a few global constraints was  ~<em><em>also</em></em>~  outside my budget. Lacking those has led to data loss—never more than a few minute’s worth, but still. I felt bad. Thankfully, someone else recently picked up the project and will be correcting those omissions.</p>
<p>But we disagreed immediately on how to do it! I thought we should  ~<em><em>present</em></em>~  the errors: “These events overlap!” The other person thought we should make the errors impossible: when you edit a timestamp, you implicitly edit all the others that are involved in the constraint.</p>
<p>I generally agree with their approach. I mean, it’s baked into the rest of the UI. When you change an event type, it changes the rest of the sentence. But if you change the type back, the sentence structure is restored and your previous values all come back. Cascading edits are more destructive than that. They force you to be careful about what you change and to be observant of unintended side-effects.</p>
<p>The block editor problem of representing invalid states is another way to look at it. Sometimes the most efficient path between two valid states passes through an invalid one. If you want to reorder two events, for example, a first step might be to copy the start and end times from one to the other, as part of an “a = b; b = oldA” sequence. They overlap until you’re done. To do the same without ever breaking global constraints requires user ingenuity or a more featureful editor with a “swap events” button. Requiring user ingenuity wastes a lot of time and energy and happiness over the lifetime of the UI, but observing users and adding features to address every desired editing operation takes a lot of dev time too, and it has to happen  ~<em><em>now</em></em>~ , or else people editing this data will be blocked whenever they find an impossible edit.</p>
<p>Anyway, not too many answers here, but I thought it was an interesting case study, with thought-provoking  ~<em><em>questions</em></em>~  at least!</p>

<p>An idea is starting to form for me around prototype-based modeling being a good metaphor for programming effectively with LLMs. Essentially you can provide an example of a patttern/component/class/etc and have it return a version of it modified in specific ways, which can then be used as a prototype for future generations/instantiations.</p>
<p>A version of this idea can be seen <a href="https://twitter.com/mrmkrs/status/1725959207365583196">here with tldraw</a> where he generates the next more specific interface step off the previous one.</p>
<p>Another I'm kind of using this in my agent framework: <a href="https://github.com/sublayerapp/sublayer/blob/main/lib/sublayer/agents/generate_sublayer_agent_agent.rb">generate_sublayer_agent_agent.rb</a> where we generate new agents based off a simple agent template (and works surprisingly well).</p>
<p>I know Hofstatder digs into this concept in GEB and Steve Yegge calls it the <a href="https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/10/universal-design-pattern.html">Universal Design Pattern</a></p>
<p>Does this resonate with anyone here? Is anyone familiar with any other writing about prototype-based modeling/prototypal inheritance/etc for me to take this further?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.applevis.com/forum/app-development-programming/work-progress-vosh-third-party-screen-reader-macintosh">I’m excited to see where this 3rd party screen-reader for macOS goes.</a> On windows there are 2 first-in-class options available outside of the OS, JAWS and NVDA. On macOS there is only the system provided VoiceOver.</p>
<p>I think VoiceOver is a pretty solid competitor to NVDA, but, it is very very very opinionated, and makes some unusual choices. I think this has a knock on effect where, since VoiceOver is the easiest screen-reader for most web devs to reach for, a lot of implementations end up being hyper-focused on supporting VoiceOver’s specific flavor of handling the accessibility tree. Having more diversity in the space, I think could hopefully mitigate this. While this isn’t directly related to the future of coding as we normally talk about it here, I think projects like this are just the sort of thing that can help to shape things for years to come.</p>

<p>“shouldn’t this have been published a few months ago?” yeah, probably. I even considered submitting it to the AoC contest. time is a real beast.
The title is clickbait. I did not design and implement a programming language for the sole or even primary purpose of leaderboarding on Advent of Code. It just turned out that the programming language I was working on fit the task remarkably well.
I can’t name just a single reason I started work on my language, Noulith, back in July 2022, but I think the biggest one was even more absurdly niche: I solve and write a lot of puzzlehunts, and I wanted a better programming language to use to search word lists for words satisfying unusual constraints, such as, “Find all ten-letter words that contain each of the letters A, B, and C exactly once and that have the ninth letter K.”1 I have a folder of ten-line scripts of this kind, mostly Python, and I thought there was surely a better way to do this. Not necessarily faster — there is obviously no way I could save time on net by optimizing this process. But, for example, I wanted to be able to easily share these programs such that others could run them. I had a positive experience in this with my slightly older golflang Paradoc, which I had compiled into a WASM blob and put online and, just once, experienced the convenience of sharing a short text processing program through a link. (Puzzle: what does this program do?) I also wanted to write and run these programs while booted into a different operating system, using a different computer, or just on my phone.

<p>AFAIK Open AI has a powerful LLM system in large part due to large compute power.</p>
<p>Is there a future where small business / people can compete with mega-corps in the LLM space, or will we be renting GPT (or similar) until end the of time?</p>

<p>Off the dome I can think of excel (numerical constraints) and rhino grasshopper (architectural / physical constraints).</p>

While all of his recent animations are breathtaking and delightful and worth your attention (since, like Jacob Collier, Felix is just frustratingly talented), this video in particular will be of interest to the FoC community for its contributions to classic GUI design.</p>

<p>Hey everyone -- long-time lurker, first time poster. Thrilled to share the open beta launch of MightyMeld, a visual dev tool for React I've been building with some friends of mine. <a href="https://www.mightymeld.com/">mightymeld.com</a></p>
<p>Just posted this blog post telling the story and why I'm excited -- <a href="https://mightymeld.com/blog/open-beta">mightymeld.com/blog/open-beta</a></p>
<p>Would love to hear your thoughts! I'm a former academic who's been driven into industry out of a desire to make the theoretical practical. MightyMeld is a "visual coding" that is not like any kind of "visual coding" i would've imagined if we hadn't've built this thing starting from real production code and saying "how can we make this more visual".</p>

<p>I’m developing a cutting-edge tool that leverages ChatGPT to ghost-write prose based on my point-form outlines, particularly focusing on ‘new ideas’ that the AI wasn’t trained on. The challenge lies in preventing hallucinations and incorrect extrapolations from the outline. Early experimental results have been promising prompting me to create a dedicated workflow tool. This tool enables me to swiftly input point-form outlines, using the user-friendly Kinopio platform for brainstorming. I then paste the outline to ChatGPT, transforming it into coherent and readable prose. Join me in revolutionizing idea development and content creation with this innovative solution! [ChatGPT]</p>

<p>Hi, the last month I've been focussing a lot on fixing some bugs in the way nodes are connected and improving the different path types that are used.</p>
<p>This small demo video <a href="https://youtu.be/cnD-AlDQJDk">(Creating new flow using a "back-loop" and placing the "back-loop" connection on a separate layer)</a> shows creating a very small flow from scratch, the functionality of the flow is not important here.. but the thing I wanted to show is the way a "backloop" is created. The system uses a different svg path for backloops: normal nodes are connected using a bezier curve but when the output node is placed before the start node, the path changes to a "back-loop". </p>
<p>Another thing to notice is the layering.. the back-loop is placed on its own layer, hopefully keeping bigger flows more clear. You can toggle which layer is in front. </p>

<p>Hey folks! I'm doing some research into code formatters/pretty printers, with a view to potentially building my own. Does any one have any examples of code formatters that they've found especially fast, or that they know of which have a special focus on performance?</p>
<p>I'm interested in learning about some of the potential techniques at play - what sort of caching and parallelization is being done, are they doing incremental parsing like tree-sitter etc..</p>

<p>Over the years, I've thought about different ways of creating an interactive tutorial about writing a simple programming language. For example, you can create a "wizard" style with next and back buttons, or you can create one single page with the code floating on the right side of the content (possibly sticky). One detail is that each example would grow in size (for the complete code), but would only focus on one sub-section. I thought about collapsing sections already covered, but being able to expand them, or just have a single button to expand all the hidden code. Has anyone had experience or have seen articles that use a "build from small to large", showing code along the way?</p>

<p>I’ve been working on a tool to get a high level view of an entire typescript codebase to help me understand/navigate it.</p>
<p>It shows all the functions and interfaces. Every  <code>interface</code>  is represented by a color, and the signature of a function is shown with these colors.</p>
<p>I need some help with a better algorithm to transform the name of the  <code>type</code>  into to a color. e.g. the type  <code>string</code>  -&gt; blue,  <code>int</code>  -&gt; green, etc.</p>
<p>The problem is that I’m not sure what I want the output to be, how should the color space be distributed? how should colors be clustered?</p>
<p>I think I can copy what code editors use for  <code>semantic highlighting</code> , but I haven’t been able to find an implementation of it.</p>
<p>Does anyone have ideas on what I should search for?</p>
<p>Happy to explain more, if it’s not clear.</p>
<p>PS. Here is how a codebase currently looks. White rectangles are files, interfaces are shown on the top, and functions on the bottom</p>

I spontaneously decided to project your example to an ALD mockup to get a bit of a feeling for inhowfar ALDs are compatible with your code projection focused of concatenative code.
Seems pretty good.</p>
<p>★ One nice thing with ALDs is that library functions are threated exactly the same as argument values. They come in as semi-implicit arguments via the grey collection abstraction-line.
★ One annoying (but I think good) restriction of ALD is that functions (and definitions in let sections) can only ever have just one single value-line as their final output (except one cheats a bit as I've done here with memocurry :smiling_imp:).</p>

<p><em>Replacing authentication with visual identity</em> </p>
<p>Background: I'm starting to think about building a new forum. Given <a href="https://akkartik.name/freewheeling/">my past</a>, it won't surprise anyone that I mean to do this outside the morass of non-convivial software that is the modern web browser. My broad plan is:</p>
<ul>
<li>LÖVE v12 will support https, and <a href="https://github.com/love2d/love/actions">release candidates</a> are already quite stable. Good enough to start building on.</li>
<li>I'll build my forum out of a server-side API in Lua and a client in LÖVE v12. (Should be easy to support Windows, Linux, BSD and Android. Mac and iOS will require some annual contortions to build LÖVE for oneself.)</li>
<li>The server side will of course be open source just like the client. In addition, all post/comment data will be published to a git repo on something like a daily basis.</li>
</ul>
<p>The one major open question concerns authentication. How can we have stable identity? The above architecture is intended to allow anyone to host the forum (without trying to build galaxy-brain merkle trees, federated protocols or CRDTs), and I would prefer to not take a position of power as the source of everyone's hashed passwords (an intrinsically centralizing architecture).</p>
<p>A few months ago someone showed me this ancient essay called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091126092028/http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2009/3/12/33338/3000">"attacked from within"</a>, and I find myself thinking about it often. The whole thing is worth reading, but for this thread the crucial list of bullets halfway down is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Registration keeps out good posters.</li>
<li>Registration lets in bad posters.</li>
<li>Registration attracts trolls.</li>
<li>Anonymity counters vanity.</li>
</ul>
<p>A provocative worldview that seems at least worth exploring. Keeping this in mind, I have a hazy idea that looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you run the client you get to choose your handle, but it's not unique (cf. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle">Zooko's Triangle</a>)</li>
<li>When you run the client for the first time, it creates an RSA keypair for you.</li>
<li>When composing messages, the client signs the message with your private key (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#Signing_messages">description on Wikipedia</a>)</li>
<li>When rendering messages, the client validates the signature against your public key and shows something like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identicon">identicon</a> of the public key.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implications of this setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>No registration</li>
<li>Your "password" (private key) never leaves your device(s).</li>
<li>When reading a thread you see a handle like  <code>spiralganglion</code> . However, the handle is not authoritative. Next to it is an identicon that is authoritative.</li>
<li>It's easy in a thread to see if there are ever two people with the same handle but different identicons.</li>
<li>Since the client platform is starting from scratch, accessibility and internationalization will be a challenge for a long time 😕</li>

<p>No guarantees this is all doable. It's quite possible the cryptographic operations will be untenably slow when implemented in Lua, and a native library for them would complicate the simple install story that is LÖVE's greatest strength.</p>
<p>But I'm curious to get people's thoughts on this idea in principle.</p>

<p>Maybe more of a general coding question but how do you y’all feel about database/stores that add fields to your documents that insert?</p>
<p>E.g. you insert  <code>{ name: 'Titanic', director: 'James Cameron' }</code>  into  <code>movies</code>  and when you fetch it you get back  <code>{_id: 1234, _col: 'movies', name: 'Titanic', director: 'James Cameron' }</code> </p>
<p>Does that bug you? Don’t care?</p>
<p>Are there any ways to get around this so there aren’t won’t ever have collections between user defined fields and internal metadata?</p>

<p>One of the things I am curious about is how a11y relates to the future of coding. So far it doesn't seem to come up in the discussions on the podcast but I think there is something to be said about the advancement in a11y in computing over the last 25 years and a large part of this is due to a movement away from some of the more creative interface designs (ala Magic Ink). Is there a future of code that is more accessible to people with different abilities?</p>

<p>In the past year or 2, I got interested in OO and I find even its basic form within a mainstream language very powerful.</p>
<p>Yet, when I try to advocate for using polymorphism in almost any context, I get "this is too unfamiliar"/"that's not how we do things in framework X" instead advocating for switch statements or similar.</p>
<p>And it really gets me thinking, if we don't even understand OO after 30 years of mainstream adoption (in some form or another) and are still doing "structured programming" with lambdas &amp; objects, is generic code just hopeless in practice? Is there an education problem? Is it just indicative of how poor standards are that few people have the privilege to do any amount of design for their systems before developing?</p>
<p>If so, how does "future of coding" even matter if any form of real adoption feels impossible.</p>

<p>(Making a new thread about this because the other one has become about OO instead of this bit)</p>
<p>I feel this deeply. It can often feel as if things don't get adopted. That programming doesn't change for the better. I have so many thoughts on this, it is hard to summarize.</p>
<p>First, I do think we can get others to adopt the things we value. It is almost never an education issue, imo and instead a value question. (I am intentionally leaving aside the OO frame here). Think about the impact that Rich Hickey has had on how many people code, not just clojure people, but in the industry broadly. How did he do it? Through Simple Made Easy, a talk largely about values, not techniques. The same is true of Bret Victor's influence on the future of coding community. He communicated values that others adopted.</p>
<p>I've found this to be true in practice as well. Trying to convince people to change their coding style requires diligence, communicating values, and showing how code improves because of these values. Conflict often happens when people implicitly hold very different values. I'm going to bet that is the case in the original example given.</p>
<p>But I also want to step back and ask, what kind of adoption, by who, by how many people? I'm willing to bet a lot of people in this slack listen to some genre of music that isn't completely mainstream. Have those genres failed because of the lack of becoming mainstream? Would they be better if they became mainstream?</p>

<p>I’m looking to learn more about a space, that I’m not sure exists. Does this word comob trigger associations to existing projects: spreadsheet, schema, hierarchy?</p>

<p>What do people here think about the REBL (read-eval-browse-loop) and the ‘Data Rabbit’ project which evolved from it?</p>
<p>Both are tools originating in Clojure, but where the REBL is about mixing writing/running Clojure with having a graphical interface to drill down into the output data (e.g. a natural ‘visual programming’ evolution of a REPL),</p>
<p>I’d describe Data Rabbit as the opposite: A data inspection/‘dashboard creation’ tool where you can do most tasks visually, only dropping down to Clojure if you want to do really custom things (or create new types of ‘blocks’/interactions).</p>

<p>And in not totally unrelated fashion, there’s PureData (FOSS) / Cycling76' Max (paid), which are reasonably successful graph-based programming languages for digital music synthesizers.</p>
<p>I expect that in that particular case graph-based programming is so successful because it is a direct translation of how (analog) modular synthesizers used to be patched together, flattening the learning curve for musicians.</p>

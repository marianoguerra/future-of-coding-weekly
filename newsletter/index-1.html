<p>Today we released our Slack bot for anyone working with companies or communities with active link sharing and discussions. (Also available as a discord bot!)</p>
<p>The bots give you a searchable archive of all links, videos, events, pdfs that people post in your Slack channel. (Search coming this or latest early next week!)</p>
<p>Bit like the archive here at the Future of Coding Slack.</p>
<p>Also it's GPT supported to give you summaries of articles and youtube videos, so you can much more easily see if things are worth watching/reading.</p>

<p>Friends, I don't know what to make of developments in AI these days.  Having worked on dialog systems in the aughts and having loosely followed developments since (I recall preparing a talk around 2010 which left me pretty enthusiastic about ML applications in contrast to the App-and-Facebookification of "tech" — that was on time horizon of a few years, which ended up being a decade plus), every day I check in on Twitter I see more exciting stuff than I can possibly process.  I was just writing someone yesterday about how in six months time, we'll have LLMs acting as the front-end to knowledge bases and rigorous computational systems, and then we'll need to focus on getting the human, AI, and formal model all on the same page.</p>
<p>As has already been noted in <strong>#linking-together</strong> today, my estimate was off by roughly six months.  Consider, "I've developed a lot of plugin systems, and the OpenAI ChatGPT plugin interface might be the damn craziest and most impressive approach I've ever seen in computing in my entire life. For those who aren't aware: you write an OpenAPI manifest for your API, use human language descriptions for everything, and that's it. You let the model figure out how to auth, chain calls, process data in between, format it for viewing, etc. <a href="https://twitter.com/mitchellh/status/1638967450510458882">There's absolutely zero glue code</a>".</p>
<p>If you can tolerate his prose, Stephen Wolfram has a long post (<a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/03/chatgpt-gets-its-wolfram-superpowers/">ChatGPT Gets Its “Wolfram Superpowers”!</a>).  The "Wolfram Language as the Language for Human-AI Collaboration" section is most relevant to Future of Coding.  What do these developments mean for the Future of Coding?  And how are you all holding up?  Me?  I can hardly process what's happening, let alone what to do about it.</p>

<p>So, I'm an EUP person at heart, and this ChatGPT thing has obviously got me thinking all over again about what programming would look like to a non-technical person. At heart, I feel it should be like they're "casting spells" over reality (or virtual reality). This tips into the area of cognitive modelling: how close the physical manifestation needs to be to be able to be abstracted up to a satisfying cognitive model that matches the human's intention. In other words, you cast a spell "make that banana green!" and it comes back a lurid dayglo green, that would be a cognitive dissonance because really, you'd expect to simply get a very unripe-looking banana. What are the elements of this formalised spell-casting, this "programming system"? You have objects (banana, this one, not all ones), attributes (green, the correct one!), a sense of time or evolution (went from yellow to green). You start to get into Roget's Thesaurus land: what are the key concepts for describing the world, our human world?</p>
<p>Anyway, just a splat of the stuff buzzing around my head right now. Thoughts?</p>

<p>Does anyone know of something like a basic test suite for developing a language? </p>
<p>My idea is that in addition to building up test cases that implement specific functionality, what if I had a corpus of programs and a source to source compiler I could retarget to my new language? </p>
<p>I can think of a lot of things that would make this hard—mutability vs immutability, semantics of basic data types, etc. </p>
<p>An easier question: does anyone know of test suites for existing languages that are compact but thorough? </p>
<p>(This is ignoring questions about modularity and more complicated forms of abstraction—that seems even more hopeless to tackle in a generic way).</p>
<p>For anyone who’s written a language, how did you tackle testing? </p>

<p>Just discovered a podcast called the "Future of Code" by a nice young man named Steve Krowse. Listen to the 3 minute introduction here: <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/001">futureofcoding.org/episodes/001</a></p>
<p>You may have come across it already but if not, I do recommend giving episode 1 a listen! Can't help but admire Steve's 'can-do' attitude and optimism. And if you get to episode 2, you find out that the whole podcast started out through teaching kids to code. It's very charming!</p>

<p>This is an incredibly thinky group of folks. I’m wondering how, if at all, this little community has been using these LLMs and advanced chat bots. People are playing Pokemon in a text/CLI form just by asking “let’s play pokemon but with text and skip all the boring parts”*. I have to conclude that a number of you folks have made some crazy strides in the work you’ve been doing or how you’ve been refining your ideas with these tools.</p>

<p>Are note-taking apps "too mutable"?</p>
<p>When I'm working on a page of notes (to develop my ideas or knowledge about a topic), I'll typically edit it for a few days, after which it tends to "congeal" into something that is too big to keep working on. My compulsion is then to refactor the page into several new pages, keeping the ideas that seem "good" and deleting or deprecating the ideas that turned out to be "bad". But refactoring my notes tends to take a fair amount of time, and I'm not sure it's worth the cost. There's a reasonable chance I will never read the notes again, because what was valuable about the note-writing was the  <em>ideas</em>  that developed in my mind  <em>as I was writing them</em> .</p>
<p>The  <em>exercise</em>  had value. But the notes resulting from the exercise may not have much value.</p>
<p>Thus, I've begun to wonder whether I would appreciate a note-taking app that <em>locks you out of your old notes</em> . Perhaps this happens if you haven't touched a note for a few days, or maybe it happens overnight, every night.</p>
<p>Immutable notes aren't a new idea. Humans have been writing immutable notes ever since they started carving glyphs into stone.</p>
<p>Computers have given us the ability to endlessly edit a page of text. But maybe having mutable pages is detrimental, for many kinds of note-taking.</p>
<p>Food for thought 🤔.</p>

<p>today's progress, emoji support! it mostly consisted of  <code>text =&gt; new Intl.Segmenter('en').segment(text).map(s =&gt; s.segment)</code>  in a bunch of places, so that offset calculations made sense. I also had to add a hidden  <code>&lt;input/&gt;</code>  onto the page instead of just harvesting  <code>keypress</code> , because emoji-pickers don't actually send valid keypresses, but they do trigger  <code>oninput</code>  in a focused  <code>&lt;input/&gt;</code>  🎉</p>

It allows the user to make fully-, partially-, or un-ground statements that are true, false, or unknown , answers the query with natural language explanations that set out the assumptions being used for unknowns, and then recommends additional fact statements that would be relevant to finding additional conclusions that are not based on assumptions. It's aimed at encoding statutes and regulations in such a way as to allow those encodings to be made, or at least validated, by lawyers and other non-programmers.

<p>Hey folks, I have been hanging around Future-of-Code-like communities for a few years, trying to figure out what I want my focus to be. I’ve finally figured it out, and I made a demo video to share with y’all about what I’m working on.</p>
<p>It’s a web and mobile app for tracking your personal information, including allowing end users to configure buttons and actions to customize their workflow. It’s not groundbreaking research, but it does enable end users to create interactive software anywhere they are. I’ve been able to replace at least four apps I previously used with “boards” I’ve configured in this app. I plan to open-source it and set up a free open-registration server soon.</p>
<p>Here’s the demo if anyone would like to take a look!</p>

<p>What do you do to motivate yourself to update documentation? I have so much of it that it is now a significant undertaking to keep it up to date with the tool, and I am losing interest. I'm trying to figure out whether I should just tag most of it as out-of-date and come back to it later when there are enough users to justify it...</p>

<p>What's the general consensus on node based scripting?</p>
<p>I'm intrigued by Unreal's Blueprint node based scripting tools - they seem easy to use, but if you want to do anything complex then (for me) it becomes very messy very quickly. However with the general move in the past 10 years or so to more functional programming and serverless etc then perhaps it makes sense. Small components that can be wired together visually feels  <em>easy</em> , or  <em>right</em> ?</p>
<p>Darklang is another example with extrapolates the complexities of the underlying system allowing you to just write some pseudo node based (at least when I last looked at it) components that are easily wired up together.</p>
<p>I'm an iOS engineer by trade, and it feels that something like Darklang / node based coding could end up matching nicely with SwiftUI's declarative syntax for UI.</p>

<p>Multi-single-tasking:</p>
<p>Brainstorming, half-baked...</p>
<p>I would have ignored Ceptre in the past.  It claims to be a language for writing games.  The very idea makes me yawn. But, one of the guys at the Torlisp monthly meetup is deeply into robotics and Scheme and another guy, in the film industry, uses Racket for hobbying in game programming.  My own interest is in concurrency and simplicity and compiler-writing.  These fields are all related.  Watching the 2015 Strangeloop presentation about Ceptre piqued my interest.  Ceptre is logic programming, but with a twist - it has a built-in notion of explicit ordering.  I thought that I could knock off a better game language using my diagrams of state machines. I continued to learn about Ceptre.  Aside: Ohm-JS has built-in explicit ordering and is “not” context-free.  I have to wonder if Ceptre is to generalized formalism as PEG (Ohm-JS) is to context-free grammar formalisms.</p>
<p>Dunno yet.</p>

<p>Thinking about building some visual programming tools after taking a break for a while. One fun idea that popped up: hybrid text + node-wire environment where you can  ~<em><em>wire to the text</em></em>~ . Like, a word in the text can act as a node. Probably been done somewhere, but I haven't seen it, so I'm kinda jamming on the thought. Like, what if Natto but you exploded the frames, brought some of Bret's Tangle in there, little bit of that style of annotating an image+paragraph by coloring a word the same as a corresponding thing in the image. Constants in the text live-update, etc etc.</p>

<p>FWIW - here’s how I think about it...  You are programming a MACHINE. Every bit of syntax has to DO something (have a meaning).  [The meaning of comments is “to be ignored by the machine”.  A lot of other syntactic baubles have that same meaning - e.g. stick people and clouds].  What does it mean to connect a wire to a word?  What happens if you connect that same wire to a different word?</p>

<p>Been making good steady progress on my new editor. I now have my wasm extensions
automatically interrupt. So I can have a long running computation (or even an
infinite loop) happening in an extension, on the same thread and not miss any
frame times. Having that really sets the ground work for the live programming
model I want for these "extensions".</p>
<p>After some clean up I'm starting to do some dog fooding for another project I'm
working on, generating an arm64 assembler from the xml specification of
instructions. The plan is to write the coding utilizing my editor as the
visualization environment to get fast feedback on if I have the instructions
correct. Still a long way to go, but the fundamentals are taking shape.</p>

<p>Perhaps you too are wondering if software is inherently spatial. A great paper
on this topic is “Software is an Abstract Artifact” by Nurbay Irmak. I might not
agree with everything written, but it is a very readable paper and a great
introduction to the topic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Software is a ubiquitous artifact, yet not much has been done to understand
its ontological nature. There are a few accounts offered so far about the
nature of software. I argue that none of those accounts give a plausible
picture of the nature of software. I draw attention to the striking
similarities between software and musical works. These similarities motivate
to look more closely on the discussions regarding the nature of the musical
works. With the lessons drawn from the ontology of musical works I offer a
novel account of the nature of software. In this account, software is an
abstract artifact. I elaborate the conditions under which software comes into
existence; how it persists; how and on which entities its existence depends.</p>

<p>I’m curious “where” people think of visual in visual programming being. For
context, I spend a lot of time in tools like Houdini, Solidworks, Cavalry, and
After Effects. Some of them have more access to computation than others, but the
biggest difference between those and Processing or threejs is a large “standard
library” of functions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, building a website with live feedback or scripting in a REPL
seem like a very different experience from just writing the same code in
notepad. I wonder if visual programming is all just “debug views” rather than
the specific presence of a GUI. And if so, what does that mean for generalized
visual languages or environments?</p>

<p>I am not sure but this might be a <em>thing</em> - in order to reduce scrolling through
files I try to keep each function in respective separate file (so I have over
hundred of files so far) and I wrote a simple code that copies the content of
the function into the body of the html page and adds some template text like
<em>&lt;script&gt; tags etc.</em></p>
<p>I try to find the most minimal set of tools in the motto of <em>bicycle for mind</em> -

<p>Hello everyone! 👋 I am thrilled to share the progress made with Flyde with this
community of like-minded individuals.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flyde.dev">Flyde</a> is an open-source, flow-based, and visual
programming toolkit that prioritizes exceptional UX/DX and seamless integration
with existing code. The toolkit features a VSCode extension, visual debugging,
full TypeScript support, a rich standard library, and is designed to work in
tandem with existing codebases. In essence, Flyde is similar to NodeRED, but
geared towards web development.</p>
<p>This is the first time I am sharing Flyde with a broader community, and I
believe feedback from such a talented, inquisitive, and passionate group of
people would be invaluable to the project.</p>
<p>Check out the interactive playground here -
<a href="https://www.flyde.dev/playground/">flyde.dev/playground</a>!</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback! Additionally, a star on
GitHub would be greatly appreciated! 😊</p>

<p>Today I put together a little visualizer for Mastodon threads. The graph layout
is nothing special, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>it has structured keyboard shortcuts (up for parent, down for child,
  left/right for siblings) which might be more useful for understanding a
  complex thread</li>
<li>as always you can live-edit it so it's hopefully easy to improve</li>
</ul>
<p>One other little integration: opening links in browsers opens up all sorts of
cross-platform cans of worms, so I ended up just copying a URL to the clipboard
any time you click on a toot.</p>

<p>Hey everyone! Really excited about this new feature we shipped today at Subset,
which allows you to jump between your different files kind of like Notion. I’ve
noticed that I have a ton of little trackers and calculators that I eventually
forget about, but every time I come across it again, it reminds me of a task I
need to do. Ultimately, it makes individual files and spreadsheets less
ephemeral. Here’s what it looks like. Next up we probably need some grouping or
favoriting system. Let me know if you have any thoughts 🙂</p>

<p>Jimmy and I have each read this paper a handful of times, and each time our
impressions have flip-flopped between “hate it so much” and “damn that’s good”.
There really are two sides to this one. Two reads, both fair, both worth
discussing: one of them within “the frame”, and one of them outside “the frame”.
So given that larger-than-normal surface for discursive traversal, it’s no
surprise that this episode is, just, like, intimidatingly long. This one is so,
so long, friends. See these withered muscles and pale skin? That’s how much time
I spent in Ableton Live this month. I just want to see my family.</p>
<p>No matter how you feel about Brooks, our thorough deconstruction down to the
nuts and bolts of this seminal classic will leave you holding a ziplock bag full
of cool air and wondering to yourself, “Wait, this is philosophy? And this is
the future we were promised? Well, I guess I’d better go program a computer now
before it’s too late and I never exist.”</p>

<p>Before and after. Does the paragraph form seem "better"? Took a surprising
amount of work, because I had to abandon the NLG being done by the reasoner and
write my own version that knows how to deal with nested terms. I'm thinking the
new one is probably better for validation, worse for debugging, but I'm not
sure.</p>

<p>Code is a weird medium. It can act directly upon the world at scale. The only
other "things" that can do that are the fundamental forces of the universe.</p>
<p>Code is essentially a kind of Jinn/Genie: Agency in a bottle. Jinn also
translates to

<p>Spending most of this week taking tree-structured explanations, and generating something approximating a series of paragraphs, then annotating them with cross references like a graph for navigation purposes. The result is persuasive for my target audience. An explanation that they can read and understand and navigated easily is a big deal for demonstration purposes. But I am hating it, because it is technologically trivial. Any tips for getting through the slog of actually doing the thing that is time consuming, valuable, but uninspiring?</p>

<p><a href="https://marianoguerra.github.io/future-of-coding-weekly/history/weekly/2023/02/W1/linking-together.html#2023-01-30T11:02:46.637Z">🧵 conversation</a></p>
<p><a href="https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2212.06094">Prompting Is Programming: A Query Language For Large Language Models</a></p>
<p>we present the novel idea of Language Model Programming (LMP). LMP generalizes language model prompting from pure text prompts to an intuitive combination of text prompting and scripting. Additionally, LMP allows constraints to be specified over the language model output. This enables easy adaption to many tasks, while abstracting language model internals and providing high-level semantics.</p>
<p>To enable LMP, we implement LMQL (short for Language Model Query Language), which leverages the constraints and control flow from an LMP prompt to generate an efficient inference procedure that minimizes the number of expensive calls to the underlying language model.</p>
<p>We show that LMQL can capture a wide range of state-of-the-art prompting methods in an intuitive way, especially facilitating interactive flows that are challenging to implement with existing high-level APIs. Our evaluation shows that we retain or increase the accuracy on several downstream tasks, while also significantly reducing the required amount of computation or cost in the case of pay-to-use APIs (13-85% cost savings).</p>

<p>Today I gave each app a default map for its code, so that people get a better initial experience when connecting the driver to it, rather than the blank canvas they've been faced with so far.</p>
<p>Initialization is one of the categories of semantics that's hard to write tests for. What should happen when a config file is present. The driver maintains separate configs for each app it knows about, so it needs to handle the very first app vs first view of a new app. What if the app has no default map. Etc., etc.</p>

<p>Never came across "Neuro-symbolic programming paradigm" but looks interesting 😂</p>

<p>Updates on future of coding's link search page: <a href="http://history.futureofcoding.org/history/links/">history.futureofcoding.org/history/links</a></p>
<p>Avoid screen freezes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Links data streaming download and parsing by segments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filter by segments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Result pagination (less to render on refilter)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Shareability:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If search query parameter is set, search that on load</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example: <a href="http://history.futureofcoding.org/history/links/?search=hest">history.futureofcoding.org/history/links/?search=hest</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update search query param on search update</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Usability:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sort by most recent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Table layout fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Result pagination</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keyboard shortcuts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>f: first, l: last, n: next, p: prev, N: page + 10, P: page - 10, s: focus search</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loading status</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Row highlight on hover</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Try it:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://history.futureofcoding.org/history/links/?search=alan%20kay">history.futureofcoding.org/history/links/?search=alan%20kay</a></li>
<li><a href="http://history.futureofcoding.org/history/links/?search=bret%20victor">history.futureofcoding.org/history/links/?search=bret%20victor</a></li>
</ul>
<p>PS: I listed the improvements in detail mostly to highlight how many things are involved in a "simple" app that only has a search box and a result list, I think it's a nice <a href="https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/">7GUIs</a> style app specification to benchmark future of coding projects</p>

<p>I have been creating a graph-based notetaking app; I am curious about the current landscape. I see Roam/Obsidian/Logseq sort of in the same category (with Obsidian Canvas as a feature with a lot of potential), and Tana (which I just learned about) goes one step further by nodifying more things. Are there any other killer features/products in this space?</p>

<p>I enjoyed this assessment.  I lived through the shift to recursion. I note, though, that recursion and functions make sense only for single-threaded pieces of hardware which is how CPUs and Memory were perceived in the 1950s.  Today, we can have bowls full of CPUs with their own local memories, which changes the ground truth about hardware.  While it is possible to extrapolate recursion to describe distributed systems, the recursive  mind-set leads to epicycles such as thread safety, multi-tasking operating systems, thread libraries, loops, etc., i.e. a generally horrible DX (Developer eXperience) for creating distributed programs.</p>

<p>Online collaboration is becoming prevalent in our day-today work. As commercial applications show, next to texts, spreadsheets are an essential tool for storing and organizing shared data. However, concurrent modifications of a collaborative spreadsheet can lead to unexpected results when they reflect implementation decisions rather than user intention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this paper, we systematically discuss spreadsheet operations and their semantics and propose intention-preserving designs in a concurrent decentralized setting, thus supporting offline operations. We further explore different data models for shared spreadsheets based on composed Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) and give an implementation in the local-first framework Yjs.</p>

<p>Structured editing can show benefits in learnability, tool building, and editing efficiency in programming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, creating a usable structured editor is laborious and demanding, typically requiring tool builders to manually create or adjust editing interactions.</p>
<p>We present Sandblocks, a system that allows users to automatically generate structured editors for every language with a formal grammar available.</p>
<p>Our system's input reconciliation process acts on arbitrary syntax trees to provides consistent interactions across our generated editors.</p>
<p>Our editors' editing experience is designed to be familiar to users from textual editing but, compared to previous work, requires no manual annotation in the grammars.</p>

<p>Welp, I let my desire for novelty get the best of me, spent two days making cosmetic changes that weren't actually needed for anything, spent another two days digging myself out from under all the bugs I created in the process. Then I started work on the thing I should actually have been doing on Monday, and it's noon on Friday and the half-fix I have implemented has created other, worse problems than the problem I'm trying to fix. So a week has gone by, and the tool LOOKS way better, and WORKS way worse. Yay, I guess.</p>

<p>Been thinking about the infra needed for human-machine teaming, I think a lot of knowledge from the field of business process management can be reimagined, just with powerful natural language capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural language becomes the API interface between humans and machines.</li>
<li>No need to formally describe the workflow. Just talk to it and let the LLM create/modify/delete these.</li>
<li>These workflows are essentially Turing-complete, distributed program where the job "processors" are people and bots. For eg: BPMN already supported branching, sequential processing, parallel processing etc.</li>
<li>Open-source Zapier-equivalent systems can be a good starting point for these.</li>

<p>Finished a version with event reasoning, didn't even really have a chance to test it before realizing there is at least one more missing feature needed for my current project, namely predicates with an arity of greater than 2. Added that as a feature to the block language and the reasoner on Monday. Added it to the API for the reasoner yesterday. Today I need to implement it in the "Scenario Editor" which allows users to describe facts, run queries against those facts, and display the results. Absolutely dreading it. Wish me luck.</p>

<p>When we ask questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should we use static or dynamic types?</li>
<li>Should we practice TDD?</li>
<li>Should we do agile development?</li>
<li>Should we use a memory safe-language?</li>
</ul>
<p>People often say that the correct answer to all these questions is just to look at what the research shows. If research shows these things are good, then we should use them, if not, then not. In fact, this sort of response can be used to rebut almost anything we want to explore in the future of coding community. Why are we so interested in "X" if "X" hasn't been shown to be better via research? This sort of response has always bothered me. So I wrote a blog post on that question.</p>

<p>I just published a little app to draw graphs: <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~akkartik/snap.love">git.sr.ht/~akkartik/snap.love</a></p>
<p>I've wanted something like this for a long time. Intended for small graphs where laying things out by hand is not too painful, and it's nice that things don't move around every time I make a change, as happens with graphviz (<a href="https://graphviz.org">graphviz.org</a>). The file format is also amenable to git; no long lines, and adding new nodes or edges doesn't reorder unrelated nodes and edges.</p>
<p>Immediately after sharing it, I notice that there's also a limit on the number of edges. Too many edges, and the dumb layout algorithm (connecting centroids of nodes) starts to creak.</p>

<p>Saw a few people share snippets of Subset on Twitter so we decided to make it a lil easier by adding a screenshot feature!</p>
<p>The cool/fun tidbit is that when we needed to change the background color of the canvas before we took a screenshot, but thought it looked ugly. So we came up with this camera shutter effect, which masks the actual background changing it’s color to blue, screenshotting, and turning back to grey.</p>

<p>Someone is trying to boot Linux from a Scratch project. 😮🤯😻</p>
<p>In fact, it's a RISC-V emulator programmed with Scratch.</p>
<p>Here is his journey (quoting the author):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I actually started this project with not very much understanding of RISC-V, but after a few hours of debugging I got the hang of it. The emulator was actually based of off <a href="https://github.com/cnlohr/mini-rv32ima">github.com/cnlohr/mini-rv32ima</a>, which i ported to Java a while back, and from Java I ported to SCPP (A programming language I wrote) and from SCPP I ported it to here [(i.e. plain Scratch)].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding SCPP:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SCPP (Scratch C Plus Plus) <a href="https://github.com/Its-Jakey/SCPP">github.com/Its-Jakey/SCPP</a></p>

<p>It's really interesting to see the creativity of people that learned programming with Scratch, then start exploring new horizons to eventually come back to Scratch.</p>

<p>One of my recent discoveries is <a href="http://permacomputing.net/">Permacomputing</a> (I had encountered the term before, but never looked at it closely before). And I am wondering if anyone here has explored it more than I did, and if anyone has a view on how it might matter for the future of coding. I suspect that <a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu">Kartik Agaram</a> is aware of this because some of his projects are cited as "adjacent".</p>
<p>At first sight, the principles and overall objectives of permacomputing resonate with me, but I see a lot of theory and little practice. While I can see how such technology could be valuable in a different universe, which may of course be tomorrow's reality, my impression is that in the real world of today, permacomputing is nerd fiction.</p>

<p>Next, I would like to explore how to improve the formula input/editor. I think there is an opportunity for more structured editing while adding playfulness and intermediate value preview. I like those 2 directions so far:</p>

<p>I'm making a node-based language for a youtube video. This is my current plan: </p>
<p>It's all about 'pointing'.</p>
<p>In the engine, there are various different types of arrow. And all of these arrows can 'fire' in their own way. For example, some of them fire when you click on them. Some of them fire when they move in a cellular automata grid.</p>
<p>When an arrow fires, it <em>does something</em>. For example, some arrows make a noise. Some arrows create more arrows.</p>
<p>When an arrow fires, it also fires anything else that it points to. It could point to just one other arrow, or many, or even itself.</p>
<p>This 'firing' happens instantly. An arrow fires on the same beat as what it points to.</p>
<p>But you can change the connection, and make it fire one beat <em>later</em> instead. This lets you set up chains of events. One arrow fires, then the next, then the next. You can make loops with this quite easily. Just point an arrow back to itself at some point.</p>
<p>Here's the fun bit: Just like you can make an arrow fire one beat <em>later</em>, you can also make it fire one beat <em>earlier</em>. An arrow in the future can make an arrow fire in the past. This seems to break the rules of causation! But it doesn't, and it's possible, and I'm really excited about it.</p>

<p>Has anyone read Christopher Alexander’s  <em>The Timeless Way of Building</em>  in light of future of code? He’s the literal architect whose concept of patterns inspired the software patterns movement. In practice, Java enterprise software patterns are a lot of the past-of-code that we want to get away from. I’ve read that Alexander thought that community missed the point, and from  <em>Timeless Way</em>  I believe it. From the first chapter he gets into the concept that people should be able to build their own buildings, that it doesn’t take extensive planning, and that it resonates with something very natural within us and within the world. I don’t want to say more as I really think you need to read it in context for it to sink in; but I’d recommend picking up a copy.</p>

<p>If we assume GPT is system 1, can we get it to "develop" a system 2 by asking it the right questions?</p>
<ul>
<li>I and others have had success asking it to work step-by-step and talk out loud.</li>
<li>I've also had success asking it to provide a better answer after it answers.</li>
<li>I've tried doing a de Bono's Thinking Hats scenario to answer questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think there's some interesting work there to be done, especially regarding "frameworks". Like ask it to use a framework to answer the question. Ask it to use several different frameworks then synthesize a single answer.</p>
<p>The cool thing is, it tends to already know the framework. You don't have to program it in, you just have to ask it to use the framework.</p>
<p>I also don't know if there is any advantage to using multiple chats (that don't share history) to collaborate on an answer vs using a single chat with a single history.</p>

<p>Update on <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~akkartik/driver.love">git.sr.ht/~akkartik/driver.love</a>, my live-editing environment. It's still extremely easy (1% for me, 10% for others?) to crash the driver, so I've been trying to track down thoses corner cases. Realization: my memory of such crashes and instinct for situations causing crashes is extremely unreliable. Possibly the app's error behavior is changing under me during seemingly unrelated changes. I've been spinning my wheels on this for a couple of weeks. Hopefully it'll clarify over time. I might need a more elaborate set of tests that involve configuring a client app just so.</p>

<p>I've been thinking about how the state of a running program could be modeled as the definition of a program changing over time. This seems closely related to "image" based programming systems, right? Does anyone have thoughts or reading related to this?</p>
<p>(I got there thinking about the branchable/forkable database trend which tries to tie program version to state version.)</p>

<p>Unreal Engine are looking to release a new language, Verse, that is halfway between their visual programming language, Blueprint, and C++. Text-first, concurrency first and typed. They are framing it as a metaverse native language, that they hope to open source and standardise (port to other game environments like Unity, roblox etc too). I’m interested to see what a concurrency first language will look like from such a large player in the games industry. Seems like it’d be popular in the indie dev space (I’m starting to look into learning UE atm, and hoping it succeeds as a better alternative to C++ 😛)</p>

<p>The last couple podcasts connecting with  <em>programmer</em>  productivity reminded me of this article trying to trace software's impact — or not — on overall productivity. It's main claim is that software, so far,  has not had the expected impact on overall productivity, and that the challenge is that it is  <em>hard</em>  and  <em>expensive</em>  to model the real world within the constraints of programming. (Maybe you read it differently!) It seems to me that this is one big challenge with end-user programming, too: many people don't want to think beforehand about all the exceptions to a rule that happen in real life, since real life allows you to address those exceptions on-the-fly.</p>

<p>There are two technologies that I'd expect to be useful in the context of LLMs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Controlled natural langues (see <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/controllednaturallanguage/">sites.google.com/site/controllednaturallanguage</a> for a list), which are subsets of natural languages that can be assigned formal semantics.</li>
<li>Concatenative programming languages (<a href="https://concatenative.org/wiki/view/Concatenative%20language">concatenative.org/wiki/view/Concatenative%20language</a>), which are formal language whose syntax shares the linear structure of natural languages that is the basis of LLMs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Has anyone seen such connections pointed out or explored yet?</p>

<p>So is it the case that  <code>langchain</code>  and  <code>agents</code>  are specifically built prompt templates that are backed with some fun interprocess coms, passing the results to various piped tools like a python / JS script to get the next ‘prompt piece’, and then looping until something ‘correct’ comes up?

The resurgence of Functional Programming over the past decade owes its very existence to the Tar Pit’s snarling takedown of mutable state, championed by Hickey &amp; The Cloj-Co. Many a budding computational philosophizer — both of yours truly counted among them — have been led onward to the late great <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/062">Bro86</a> by this paper’s borrow of his  <em>essence</em>  and  <em>accident</em> . But is the paper  <em>actually</em>  good? Like, really — is it  <em>that</em>  good? Does it hold up to the blinding light of hindsight that 2023 offers? Is this episode actually an April Fools joke, or is it a serious episode that Ivan just delayed by a few weeks because of life circumstances and his own incoherent sense of humour? I can’t tell.</p>

<p>This has been the most frustrating couple of weeks I have had in the 14 months or so I have been working on this project. I'm in the process of implementing event reasoning as a language feature in Blawx. But allowing users to specify events as dates has counterintuitively required me to NOT represent them as dates in the back end. Which I discovered only after half a week of dead ends. Which in turn means that I had to rewrite my date library, throwing away about a month's worth of work, and losing several features (mostly to do with using years and months as units of duration). That worked, and had some other benefits including speed, but in turn has changed where the valuable information lives in the system's responses (from the values given to variables, if any, to the constraints imposed on those values), which means that I have to rebuild significant parts of the way responses are displayed to users. Everytime I think I have solved the problem, I discover that the solution offers three new problems. It has been an emotional rollercoaster that is driving me nuts. I want to believe that the remaining problems to solve are not hiding yet bigger problems, but I have believed that before, and this has already taken three times as long as anticipated. And I haven't even gotten to the point of being able to genuinely test it. Who knows? &lt;Venting&gt;</p>

<p>ChatGPT (4) and DALL-E seem to be very slow atm, almost unusable. What if the demand for these services grows so fast that the semiconductor industry can't keep up? Could it be that AI won't take over the world within the next couple years as either there won't be enough computational power to run all the queries, or the prices will be hiked by a lot to balance the demand for the available computation power?</p>

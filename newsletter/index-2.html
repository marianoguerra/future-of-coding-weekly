<p>This is a relatively simple concept but I think it’s quite powerful.</p>
<p>In Nette  <em>we try to allow users to grab anything that looks like interesting information</em>  and then drop it on canvas (we will turn it into the right type of blocks).</p>
<p>Here we have “X-Ray” 😎</p>
<p>Essentially Named Entity Recognition, which  <em>adds affordances to recognised phrases</em> —you can then drop any of them onto the canvas and we’ll try to make a  <em>Definition</em>  block out of it.</p>
<p>This is what it looks like 🙂</p>

<p>Lamdu now elaborates on non-trivial type errors!</p>
<p>In the screenshot several type errors are demonstrated:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple one: Text isn’t Num</li>
<li>“Occurs check”:  <code>func func</code>  means that the type of  <code>func</code>  is infinitely  <code>(((a -&gt; a) -&gt; a) -&gt; a) -&gt; …</code>  (note it can be done if wrapping in a nominal type to break the loop</li>
<li>Expand-record when inside record has the same fields. The message here isn’t yet very informative to which field is duplicated. Just says “constraints” for now</li>
<li>Scoped type variable escape (i.e “skolem”) error. This is equivalent to leaking Haskell’s  <code>ST</code>  monad’s  <code>s</code>  variable</li>
</ul>

<p>Just a small clip to show a stress test I've worked on for my new visual programming system.. maybe not super impressive, but at least it is performing better then my old system. It uses purely DOM, svg and css (transforms).</p>
<p>Creating all the nodes from javascript takes still quite long, they do all have different shapes though (using css clip-path).</p>

<p>So the answer to "can you use ProseMirror to generate a WYSIWYG-style editor that adheres to a standard XML schema for statutes" seems to be "yes, but there is a LOT of work involved in making the editing experience remotely acceptable." Normal and debug mode pictured.</p>

<p>I'm currently thinking about whether Product Managers (or other non-coder end users) can be able to make direct changes to native product without Engineers.  In the companies I've been at, there's been paper cuts and requests that engineers make to the product, which are time-consuming, tedious and take away from actual product/infra development.</p>
<p>If there are guardrails that Engineers define on certain parts of the product, are there any problems to this idea?  Curious what others think and/or have seen</p>

<p>I've been working on a specification for better, networked bookmarks.</p>
<p><em>A problem I'm currently facing:</em>  I share a lot of links. I have a channel on my Slack workspace called #walkers-claptrap where I share anything / everything that I find noteworthy. It's a bit like <strong>#linking-together</strong>. That said, not everyone I share bookmarks with (and short remarks about them) are at work, so I'm frequently duplicating and sharing over multiple lines of communication (texting, social media, slack, etc). Even then, those channels aren't easily traversed and are organized linearly. I don't love sorting things by date when their value isn't directly scoped to time. I'd also prefer to publish some place that I own and syndicate elsewhere, so that rules out Twitter.</p>
<p><em>semi-solution:</em> The claptrap specification. A graph of links / small notes. The edges are based on relationships or membership with some group. A claptrap MUST be hosted plaintext and MAY be accessed with curl or similar tool (sort of like Carmack's .plan files). A claptrap MAY expose an RSS of updates to syndicate to channels etc. A claptrap MAY reference external claptrap nodes to network / branch beyond the local graph.</p>
<p>Still very much a work in progress. Does anyone have a similar problem; do you have a solution you like? I want to bridge the gap between "personal knowledge base" and "sharing links into the ether"</p>

<p>Hey all! I need a tool / stack suggestion. We'd like to track internal metrics for development like build performance stats, build size, source control size, etc. I'd like to be able to see these trends in a graph by date/commit.</p>
<ul>
<li>CI tools can do some of this, but they only surface a small, inconfigurable set of metrics. Usually just test failures and build times.</li>
<li>There are monitoring solutions like Grafana Cloud, Datadog, but these all seem geared towards monitoring servers and cloud systems. They also assume you're ingesting massive amounts of data.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I really just want is a POST-able URL that I can spit metrics to, and a dashboard with some basic alerting. Is there something like this that exists?</p>

<p>Attending a conference today and yesterday about Blockly, the visual code editing environment. Big push toward bi-drectionality between code and blocks. For integration with existing code-bases, AI generation, collaboration with people not using visual editors, etc. At least two different approaches being investigated or used, and I would be inclined to use a completely different one. They don't realize it, but some of their problems are solved by some of the tools people here are working on. Like how do you make it so that you can generate blocks when the text is in an invalid state? Much easier to just avoid invalid states, like Blockly does! How can you avoid invalid states if the person isn't finished typing, and there are mandatory subnodes in the AST? Much easier to fill holes by default, like Blockly does. Essentially, they can't get to bidirectionality, because the text editing experience is structurally unaware. It's not possible with VSCode, but it is possible with Tylr, or anything that imposes a structure. Even ProseMirror would work better. But there is no need to stop at two concrete syntaxes, if you can sacrifice interface specific details (e.g. whitespace in text, grid position in Blockly), or keep them where they live (linter settings, a database of block locations outside the AST), you can operate directly on the AST in whatever tool you want. Has anyone played with a "headless" AST that could be used that way? It feels like all structural editors need one, particularly if they hope to facilitate collaborative editing. Has anyone tried putting two different coding interfaces over the same shared AST?</p>

<p>Addendum to the above, <a href="https://dynamicland.org/docs/2023-04-27-Communal-computing-for-21st-century-science.pdf">this PDF</a> on the Dynamicland site. Starts with a bang.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nobody asked for the invention of the graphical user interface. It wasn’t on any national research agenda. There was no demand from users — they were a small cadre of professionals using computing for specialized technical tasks, and accepted command-driven textual interfaces as simply what it meant to use a computer. There was no demand from the public — most people never expected to touch a computer in their lives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concepts around directly manipulating information arranged spatially on a screen were invented unbidden by a small group of visionaries, particularly in the research groups of Doug Engelbart and Alan Kay in the 1960s and 1970s. They believed that computing could be more than just number crunching, that it could serve as a medium for all people to see and discuss ideas, if only those ideas could be represented in visible, manipulable forms.</p>
<p>I haven't read the rest of the PDF yet, but it looks to go into a fair bit more detail about their vision for the "21st Century Science Lab" than what was hinted at in the video.</p>

<p>Alright, so we have the above  <em>visionary</em>  approach to spatial computing where you can actually touch and feel the computable things, your body is fully present in the computable space — assuming the dream comes true and it ever takes off — versus the now all-too-inevitable <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/">Vision</a> where you don't even get to <a href="http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/">touch glass</a>, your body is so absent that they have to make a <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/metahuman">meta human</a> out of you. Here's hoping the latter doesn't take the wind out of the sails of the former.</p>
<p>I'm curious to see what sorts of programming tools Apple has come up with for Vision. I'm assuming it'll be the same old Swift, SwiftUI, and Xcode (now in a spatial window), but maybe there'll be some hint of novelty in Reality Composer Pro or some other accessory tooling. But I'm far, far more interested in seeing what we all can come up with.</p>

<p>Does anyone have suggestions for a snapshot history UX for multi-dimensional data (like Excel, but with more dimensions)? It seems that most implementations for Figma, Google Workspace, and Microsoft Office 365 are pretty basic, but maybe that’s all people expect, so it’s not worth the effort to try to be clever. What do others think? I’d be pretty curious for people to suggest products which were able to “double count” the typical “snapshot” UX by thoughtfully pairing it with another need like audit-ability. For example: Procreate has a way to see the timelapse of changes to a piece of art over time. Or, you could use snapshots as a way to tell a story with data, by selecting interesting snapshots to be used as “key frames” in a presentation.</p>

<p>I finally had occasion to try out Obsidian today. Some notes after 5 minutes of use.</p>
<ul>
<li>The initial experience is a blank screen without bullets. I thought the outliner view was the #1 selling point of such tools? Do people use Obsidian to write free-form text?</li>
<li>I can copy a set of nested bullets from Obsidian to LogSeq and it works great. In the other direction, though, Obsidian loses all the nested structure I copied from LogSeq.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall the experience has been surprising. The open source clone felt like a more polished onboarding experience than the relatively proprietary and centrally coordinated product. I'm curious if that matches other people's experience.</p>

<p>Hey FoC community! I wanted to share a project we’ve been working on that we’re starting to ship more publicly called Magnet. Magnet is an AI Coding Assistant that makes it easy to use GPT-4 &amp; ChatGPT in the context of your own codebase. It’s a desktop application that runs for MacOS (Windows coming soon)</p>
<p>🧲 <a href="https://www.magnet.run">Download Magnet here</a></p>
<p>🎥 <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/a852a9ee3c224c879c490697f5bcd22f">Here’s a little video walkthrough of how the tool works today</a></p>
<p>With the new coding capabilities of LLMs we wanted to start exploring what new AI tooling for building software might look like. We’re excited for some of what is coming up as well that tries to reimagine what some of the software dev workflows might look like when there’s an AI assistant along for the ride.</p>
<p>This first version is pretty simple but we’ve already been finding it pretty useful. It’s free to use if you put in your own OpenAI API Key so feel free to give it a spin (the hosted version uses our GPT-4 API key in case you want to try out GPT-4 and don’t have access yet).</p>

<p>Ugh. I have discovered that a library exists for building a UI I have wanted for ~6 years, and I have fallen into a prototyping rabbit hole, fighting a language and a framework I'm unfamiliar with, plus good code with bad documentation. I've never seen anyone spill this many pixels on documentation and fail to mention how it is installed, fail to give a step-by-step hello world, and create dozens of examples none of which can actually be followed successfully without spending hours researching and deducing what it would have taken mere minutes to type out. It's a master class in the curse of expertise.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of this year I've started working on a new visual programming system. The project which I was working on before had too much dependencies and limited me too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkL3cFjx8XA">This is the first progress that I can share</a>. It's just a little demo showing a very small flow where you can see moving data points over the wires and changing the speed, there's no timeline yet (yes, I was inspired by Hest.. although <a href="http://ivanish.ca/">Ivan Reese</a> 's gifs still look way better offcourse 😊). I am building this without runtime dependencies (react or other framework is not used, pure vanilla javascript with my custom jsx transformer).</p>

<p>I think we need many different little languages and a substrate “language” (kernel) to bolt them all together.</p>
<p>Note that, in electronics, there is/was something called “design rules” which is something more-than-type. In web-site design, one uses “input validation” which is like type-checking but on a very per-project basis. It would be nice to be able to bolt design-rule checkers together using a palette of existing components. Again, it seems that one should want a palette of components to help build up design rule checkers and completely different palette of components to build up actions. I would expect to use different “syntaxes” for each concern and would expect to use IDE layers to deal with each kind of issue separately then let the IDE automagically stitch them together. This is just another way of saying “I would like to use a different language (SCN in my words) to deal with each kind of issue”. Would I use text-based SCNs exclusively? No. But, for text-based SCNs, I would use Ohm-JS and for diagrammatic SCNs I would start by using <a href="http://draw.io">draw.io</a>. Both kinds of syntaxes are “easy” now, so there is no reason not to build project-specific SCNs. We have been indoctrinated to believe that “one language to rule them all” GPLs is the way to go. I don’t agree.</p>

<p>Just had a meeting with my user. Singular. He's been busy writing code, and the code is working, and he's starting to feel competent with the tool. So I have a guy trained as a lawyer doing legal knowledge representation in a constraint answer set programming language, without help, and validating that code as accurate with the help of other non-coders.

<p>Since getting laid off at shopify, I've been trying to do a bit more on side projects. I've been streaming building an arm assembler that is serving as the basis for a programming language I want to build. At the simplest level, I want a dynamically typed language that compiles straight to machine code (not aot). But ultimately, I want this to serve as a platform for experimenting with features a lot of languages don't have.</p>
<p>Off stream I've been working on my editor, right now learning the bare minimum of shaders so I can play with some effects and think about ways an editor could look and work.</p>
<p>If anyone has thoughts or ideas on either of these topics, happy to hear them.</p>

<p>...“Computer” is a Misnomer, “Function” is a Misnomer, “CPU” is a Misnomer, Mathematics Notation, Verbatim, How?...</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to enable the use of diagrams as syntax (DaS).  This is but a step in that direction.</p>
<p>... “RT” is like assembler with a recursive syntax, instead of a line-oriented syntax ...</p>

<p>I enjoyed this assessment.  I lived through the shift to recursion. I note, though, that recursion and functions make sense only for single-threaded pieces of hardware which is how CPUs and Memory were perceived in the 1950s.  Today, we can have bowls full of CPUs with their own local memories, which changes the ground truth about hardware.  While it is possible to extrapolate recursion to describe distributed systems, the recursive  mind-set leads to epicycles such as thread safety, multi-tasking operating systems, thread libraries, loops, etc., i.e. a generally horrible DX (Developer eXperience) for creating distributed programs.</p>

<p>Structured editing can show benefits in learnability, tool building, and editing efficiency in programming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, creating a usable structured editor is laborious and demanding, typically requiring tool builders to manually create or adjust editing interactions.</p>
<p>We present Sandblocks, a system that allows users to automatically generate structured editors for every language with a formal grammar available.</p>
<p>Our system's input reconciliation process acts on arbitrary syntax trees to provides consistent interactions across our generated editors.</p>
<p>Our editors' editing experience is designed to be familiar to users from textual editing but, compared to previous work, requires no manual annotation in the grammars.</p>

<p>Welp, I let my desire for novelty get the best of me, spent two days making cosmetic changes that weren't actually needed for anything, spent another two days digging myself out from under all the bugs I created in the process. Then I started work on the thing I should actually have been doing on Monday, and it's noon on Friday and the half-fix I have implemented has created other, worse problems than the problem I'm trying to fix. So a week has gone by, and the tool LOOKS way better, and WORKS way worse. Yay, I guess.</p>

<p>Been thinking about the infra needed for human-machine teaming, I think a lot of knowledge from the field of business process management can be reimagined, just with powerful natural language capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural language becomes the API interface between humans and machines.</li>
<li>No need to formally describe the workflow. Just talk to it and let the LLM create/modify/delete these.</li>
<li>These workflows are essentially Turing-complete, distributed program where the job "processors" are people and bots. For eg: BPMN already supported branching, sequential processing, parallel processing etc.</li>
<li>Open-source Zapier-equivalent systems can be a good starting point for these.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finished a version with event reasoning, didn't even really have a chance to test it before realizing there is at least one more missing feature needed for my current project, namely predicates with an arity of greater than 2. Added that as a feature to the block language and the reasoner on Monday. Added it to the API for the reasoner yesterday. Today I need to implement it in the "Scenario Editor" which allows users to describe facts, run queries against those facts, and display the results. Absolutely dreading it. Wish me luck.</p>

<li>Should we practice TDD?</li>
<li>Should we do agile development?</li>
<li>Should we use a memory safe-language?</li>

In fact, this sort of response can be used to rebut almost anything we want to explore in the future of coding community. Why are we so interested in "X" if "X" hasn't been shown to be better via research? This sort of response has always bothered me. So I wrote a blog post on that question.</p>

<p>I just published a little app to draw graphs: <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~akkartik/snap.love">git.sr.ht/~akkartik/snap.love</a></p>
<p>I've wanted something like this for a long time. Intended for small graphs where laying things out by hand is not too painful, and it's nice that things don't move around every time I make a change, as happens with graphviz (<a href="https://graphviz.org">graphviz.org</a>). The file format is also amenable to git; no long lines, and adding new nodes or edges doesn't reorder unrelated nodes and edges.</p>
<p>Immediately after sharing it, I notice that there's also a limit on the number of edges. Too many edges, and the dumb layout algorithm (connecting centroids of nodes) starts to creak.</p>

<p>Saw a few people share snippets of Subset on Twitter so we decided to make it a lil easier by adding a screenshot feature!</p>
<p>The cool/fun tidbit is that when we needed to change the background color of the canvas before we took a screenshot, but thought it looked ugly. So we came up with this camera shutter effect, which masks the actual background changing it’s color to blue, screenshotting, and turning back to grey.</p>

<p>Someone is trying to boot Linux from a Scratch project. 😮🤯😻</p>
<p>In fact, it's a RISC-V emulator programmed with Scratch.</p>
<p>Here is his journey (quoting the author):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I actually started this project with not very much understanding of RISC-V, but after a few hours of debugging I got the hang of it. The emulator was actually based of off <a href="https://github.com/cnlohr/mini-rv32ima">github.com/cnlohr/mini-rv32ima</a>, which i ported to Java a while back, and from Java I ported to SCPP (A programming language I wrote) and from SCPP I ported it to here [(i.e. plain Scratch)].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding SCPP:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SCPP (Scratch C Plus Plus) <a href="https://github.com/Its-Jakey/SCPP">github.com/Its-Jakey/SCPP</a></p>

<p>It's really interesting to see the creativity of people that learned programming with Scratch, then start exploring new horizons to eventually come back to Scratch.</p>

<p>One of my recent discoveries is <a href="http://permacomputing.net/">Permacomputing</a> (I had encountered the term before, but never looked at it closely before). And I am wondering if anyone here has explored it more than I did, and if anyone has a view on how it might matter for the future of coding. I suspect that <a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu">Kartik Agaram</a> is aware of this because some of his projects are cited as "adjacent".</p>
<p>At first sight, the principles and overall objectives of permacomputing resonate with me, but I see a lot of theory and little practice. While I can see how such technology could be valuable in a different universe, which may of course be tomorrow's reality, my impression is that in the real world of today, permacomputing is nerd fiction.</p>

<p>I'm making a node-based language for a youtube video. This is my current plan: </p>
<p>It's all about 'pointing'.</p>
<p>In the engine, there are various different types of arrow. And all of these arrows can 'fire' in their own way. For example, some of them fire when you click on them. Some of them fire when they move in a cellular automata grid.</p>
<p>When an arrow fires, it <em>does something</em>. For example, some arrows make a noise. Some arrows create more arrows.</p>
<p>When an arrow fires, it also fires anything else that it points to. It could point to just one other arrow, or many, or even itself.</p>
<p>This 'firing' happens instantly. An arrow fires on the same beat as what it points to.</p>
<p>But you can change the connection, and make it fire one beat <em>later</em> instead. This lets you set up chains of events. One arrow fires, then the next, then the next. You can make loops with this quite easily. Just point an arrow back to itself at some point.</p>
<p>Here's the fun bit: Just like you can make an arrow fire one beat <em>later</em>, you can also make it fire one beat <em>earlier</em>. An arrow in the future can make an arrow fire in the past. This seems to break the rules of causation! But it doesn't, and it's possible, and I'm really excited about it.</p>

<p>Has anyone read Christopher Alexander’s  <em>The Timeless Way of Building</em>  in light of future of code? He’s the literal architect whose concept of patterns inspired the software patterns movement. In practice, Java enterprise software patterns are a lot of the past-of-code that we want to get away from. I’ve read that Alexander thought that community missed the point, and from  <em>Timeless Way</em>  I believe it. From the first chapter he gets into the concept that people should be able to build their own buildings, that it doesn’t take extensive planning, and that it resonates with something very natural within us and within the world. I don’t want to say more as I really think you need to read it in context for it to sink in; but I’d recommend picking up a copy.</p>

<p>I think there's some interesting work there to be done, especially regarding "frameworks". Like ask it to use a framework to answer the question. Ask it to use several different frameworks then synthesize a single answer.</p>
<p>The cool thing is, it tends to already know the framework. You don't have to program it in, you just have to ask it to use the framework.</p>
<p>I also don't know if there is any advantage to using multiple chats (that don't share history) to collaborate on an answer vs using a single chat with a single history.</p>

<p>Inspired by the <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/061">podcast on Programming as Theory Building</a>, I put together a <a href="https://gitlab.com/dahjelle/programming-as-theory-building-2023-04-20">short talk</a> with my attempt at trying to explain and/or share my take-aways from the paper. It's for a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/fullstackfargo/events/292846647/">local (Fargo, ND) developer meet-up</a>. I tried to steer towards the practical implications as much as I could since we have a pretty diverse (in terms of interest and skill-set) audience.</p>

<p>Update on <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~akkartik/driver.love">git.sr.ht/~akkartik/driver.love</a>, my live-editing environment. It's still extremely easy (1% for me, 10% for others?) to crash the driver, so I've been trying to track down thoses corner cases. Realization: my memory of such crashes and instinct for situations causing crashes is extremely unreliable. Possibly the app's error behavior is changing under me during seemingly unrelated changes. I've been spinning my wheels on this for a couple of weeks. Hopefully it'll clarify over time. I might need a more elaborate set of tests that involve configuring a client app just so.</p>

<p>I've been thinking about how the state of a running program could be modeled as the definition of a program changing over time. This seems closely related to "image" based programming systems, right? Does anyone have thoughts or reading related to this?</p>
<p>(I got there thinking about the branchable/forkable database trend which tries to tie program version to state version.)</p>

<p>Unreal Engine are looking to release a new language, Verse, that is halfway between their visual programming language, Blueprint, and C++. Text-first, concurrency first and typed. They are framing it as a metaverse native language, that they hope to open source and standardise (port to other game environments like Unity, roblox etc too). I’m interested to see what a concurrency first language will look like from such a large player in the games industry. Seems like it’d be popular in the indie dev space (I’m starting to look into learning UE atm, and hoping it succeeds as a better alternative to C++ 😛)</p>

<p>The last couple podcasts connecting with  <em>programmer</em>  productivity reminded me of this article trying to trace software's impact — or not — on overall productivity. It's main claim is that software, so far,  has not had the expected impact on overall productivity, and that the challenge is that it is  <em>hard</em>  and  <em>expensive</em>  to model the real world within the constraints of programming. (Maybe you read it differently!) It seems to me that this is one big challenge with end-user programming, too: many people don't want to think beforehand about all the exceptions to a rule that happen in real life, since real life allows you to address those exceptions on-the-fly.</p>

<p>There are two technologies that I'd expect to be useful in the context of LLMs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Controlled natural langues (see <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/controllednaturallanguage/">sites.google.com/site/controllednaturallanguage</a> for a list), which are subsets of natural languages that can be assigned formal semantics.</li>
<li>Concatenative programming languages (<a href="https://concatenative.org/wiki/view/Concatenative%20language">concatenative.org/wiki/view/Concatenative%20language</a>), which are formal language whose syntax shares the linear structure of natural languages that is the basis of LLMs.</li>
</ul>

<p>So is it the case that  <code>langchain</code>  and  <code>agents</code>  are specifically built prompt templates that are backed with some fun interprocess coms, passing the results to various piped tools like a python / JS script to get the next ‘prompt piece’, and then looping until something ‘correct’ comes up?

<p>Today I got a feature request from someone in the LÖVE community and created a fork of <a href="http://akkartik.name/lines.html">lines.love</a> with 2 buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>clear</code>  the buffer. I imagine this like clearing an Etch-a-sketch.</li>
<li>
<code>export</code>  the buffer to html. I imagine it emerging out of the app like a Polaroid.</li>
</ul>
<p>He sent me this screenshot from his iPad ❤</p>

<p>This has been the most frustrating couple of weeks I have had in the 14 months or so I have been working on this project. I'm in the process of implementing event reasoning as a language feature in Blawx. But allowing users to specify events as dates has counterintuitively required me to NOT represent them as dates in the back end. Which I discovered only after half a week of dead ends. Which in turn means that I had to rewrite my date library, throwing away about a month's worth of work, and losing several features (mostly to do with using years and months as units of duration). That worked, and had some other benefits including speed, but in turn has changed where the valuable information lives in the system's responses (from the values given to variables, if any, to the constraints imposed on those values), which means that I have to rebuild significant parts of the way responses are displayed to users. Everytime I think I have solved the problem, I discover that the solution offers three new problems. It has been an emotional rollercoaster that is driving me nuts. I want to believe that the remaining problems to solve are not hiding yet bigger problems, but I have believed that before, and this has already taken three times as long as anticipated. And I haven't even gotten to the point of being able to genuinely test it. Who knows? &lt;Venting&gt;</p>

<p>ChatGPT (4) and DALL-E seem to be very slow atm, almost unusable. What if the demand for these services grows so fast that the semiconductor industry can't keep up? Could it be that AI won't take over the world within the next couple years as either there won't be enough computational power to run all the queries, or the prices will be hiked by a lot to balance the demand for the available computation power?</p>

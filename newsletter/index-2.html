<p>Update on <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~akkartik/driver.love">git.sr.ht/~akkartik/driver.love</a>, my live-editing environment. It's still extremely easy (1% for me, 10% for others?) to crash the driver, so I've been trying to track down thoses corner cases. Realization: my memory of such crashes and instinct for situations causing crashes is extremely unreliable. Possibly the app's error behavior is changing under me during seemingly unrelated changes. I've been spinning my wheels on this for a couple of weeks. Hopefully it'll clarify over time. I might need a more elaborate set of tests that involve configuring a client app just so.</p>

<p>I've been thinking about how the state of a running program could be modeled as the definition of a program changing over time. This seems closely related to "image" based programming systems, right? Does anyone have thoughts or reading related to this?</p>
<p>(I got there thinking about the branchable/forkable database trend which tries to tie program version to state version.)</p>

<p>Unreal Engine are looking to release a new language, Verse, that is halfway between their visual programming language, Blueprint, and C++. Text-first, concurrency first and typed. They are framing it as a metaverse native language, that they hope to open source and standardise (port to other game environments like Unity, roblox etc too). I’m interested to see what a concurrency first language will look like from such a large player in the games industry. Seems like it’d be popular in the indie dev space (I’m starting to look into learning UE atm, and hoping it succeeds as a better alternative to C++ 😛)</p>

<p>The last couple podcasts connecting with  <em>programmer</em>  productivity reminded me of this article trying to trace software's impact — or not — on overall productivity. It's main claim is that software, so far,  has not had the expected impact on overall productivity, and that the challenge is that it is  <em>hard</em>  and  <em>expensive</em>  to model the real world within the constraints of programming. (Maybe you read it differently!) It seems to me that this is one big challenge with end-user programming, too: many people don't want to think beforehand about all the exceptions to a rule that happen in real life, since real life allows you to address those exceptions on-the-fly.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/hyperfiddle/electric">Electric Clojure</a> (previously called “Photon”) is pretty exciting, it “fully abstracts over client/server state sync at the programming language layer” which I found a bit hard to get my head around but <a href="https://electric-examples-app.fly.dev/">this new example site</a> does a great job of explaining the idea.

<p>There are two technologies that I'd expect to be useful in the context of LLMs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Controlled natural langues (see <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/controllednaturallanguage/">sites.google.com/site/controllednaturallanguage</a> for a list), which are subsets of natural languages that can be assigned formal semantics.</li>
<li>Concatenative programming languages (<a href="https://concatenative.org/wiki/view/Concatenative%20language">concatenative.org/wiki/view/Concatenative%20language</a>), which are formal language whose syntax shares the linear structure of natural languages that is the basis of LLMs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Has anyone seen such connections pointed out or explored yet?</p>

<p>So is it the case that  <code>langchain</code>  and  <code>agents</code>  are specifically built prompt templates that are backed with some fun interprocess coms, passing the results to various piped tools like a python / JS script to get the next ‘prompt piece’, and then looping until something ‘correct’ comes up?

The resurgence of Functional Programming over the past decade owes its very existence to the Tar Pit’s snarling takedown of mutable state, championed by Hickey &amp; The Cloj-Co. Many a budding computational philosophizer — both of yours truly counted among them — have been led onward to the late great <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/062">Bro86</a> by this paper’s borrow of his  <em>essence</em>  and  <em>accident</em> . But is the paper  <em>actually</em>  good? Like, really — is it  <em>that</em>  good? Does it hold up to the blinding light of hindsight that 2023 offers? Is this episode actually an April Fools joke, or is it a serious episode that Ivan just delayed by a few weeks because of life circumstances and his own incoherent sense of humour? I can’t tell.</p>

<p>In his latest, it looks to me like Grant Sanderson has brushed up his Manim (animation engine), maybe just that this video features a lot of Bret Victorish sliding.</p>

<p>Today I got a feature request from someone in the LÖVE community and created a fork of <a href="http://akkartik.name/lines.html">lines.love</a> with 2 buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>clear</code>  the buffer. I imagine this like clearing an Etch-a-sketch.</li>
<li>
<code>export</code>  the buffer to html. I imagine it emerging out of the app like a Polaroid.</li>
</ul>
<p>He sent me this screenshot from his iPad ❤</p>

<p>This has been the most frustrating couple of weeks I have had in the 14 months or so I have been working on this project. I'm in the process of implementing event reasoning as a language feature in Blawx. But allowing users to specify events as dates has counterintuitively required me to NOT represent them as dates in the back end. Which I discovered only after half a week of dead ends. Which in turn means that I had to rewrite my date library, throwing away about a month's worth of work, and losing several features (mostly to do with using years and months as units of duration). That worked, and had some other benefits including speed, but in turn has changed where the valuable information lives in the system's responses (from the values given to variables, if any, to the constraints imposed on those values), which means that I have to rebuild significant parts of the way responses are displayed to users. Everytime I think I have solved the problem, I discover that the solution offers three new problems. It has been an emotional rollercoaster that is driving me nuts. I want to believe that the remaining problems to solve are not hiding yet bigger problems, but I have believed that before, and this has already taken three times as long as anticipated. And I haven't even gotten to the point of being able to genuinely test it. Who knows? &lt;Venting&gt;</p>

<p>ChatGPT (4) and DALL-E seem to be very slow atm, almost unusable. What if the demand for these services grows so fast that the semiconductor industry can't keep up? Could it be that AI won't take over the world within the next couple years as either there won't be enough computational power to run all the queries, or the prices will be hiked by a lot to balance the demand for the available computation power?</p>

<p>Found this tool to use LLMs on command-line with pre-define roles/prompts etc</p>

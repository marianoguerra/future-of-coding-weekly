I made a project to have lots of concepts explained in Gleam tours. Gleam runs in the browser and server so I think that this might be a good platform to explain a lot of things. I've been showing Gleam to non programmers and they mostly "get it" as long as there is no installation, editor setup, deployment to worry about. My current though for the future of code is that no-code might be less important that no-ops.

I finished implementing my first tutorial quicker than I expected. You can try it here. [gleamtours.com/lustre-tutorial/introduction/welcome-to-lustre](https://gleamtours.com/lustre-tutorial/introduction/welcome-to-lustre/) It's a walk through creating a web app with Gleam and Lustre. The app is rendered in a separate window because future tours will allow you to implement a client and server and so the sandbox can't just be an element in the tours UI.

Eh, I've just spent 5 hours doing high-school-level math just to draw a couple slightly curved lines =_= [

Still just ruminating in public, but I swear there is an actual compiler taking shape

I [wrote a post](https://everythingisagile.substack.com/p/what-is-agile?r=3yfd1i&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true) about leveraging the raw core of agile to help focus attention and make cool shit. I plan to dig deeper and discuss more tools in future writing, but I would love any feedback!

Just in case someone else finds this useful, here is a small case-study of a relational program written in Prolog, from another conversation.

Simon Wardley and I had a chat about Moldable Development. It talks about programming through custom tools (by which we mean thousands of tools per system).

Perhaps it’s interesting for this community as well.

Context is all you need: Adding previous actions as context to evaluate the current prompt and avoid repetition.



# Thinking Together

I am sorry to  _interrupt_ , and this may sound like a question with an  *obvious*  answer,

but what are the  *goals*  we are trying to achieve? What are the problems we are trying  *to*   *solve* ?

[Where Unison is headed](https://www.unison-lang.org/blog/where-unison-is-headed/) by **@Paul Chiusano**






> This is a long post with a lot of details of what we're thinking for the future, so here's a summary:


* Keep keep improving the core language, runtime, and tooling. Examples: adding an FFI to Unison, improving JIT compiler performance, more semantic merge capabilities, and a more graphical UCM experience.
* Make Unison Share an even nicer place to host your projects. Examples: "find usages", site-wide code search, multi-collaborator projects, and more.
* Major new Unison Cloud features: scheduled jobs, distributed event processing, resilient workflows, and high-performance native execution via our JIT compiler.

So this is going to be more of drive by random act of gratitude non-sequiturs smorgasbord, but I’m pretty sure y’all like overtone, and I will link, so that’s the bit right? So in all my scrubbing of recent podcast listenings and reading of show notes I forked (don’t you mean formed? No, no, there was the potential future timeline of consciousness, and this is the fork) a much deeper appreciation for the plethora of references so lovingly strewn throughout the show.

This was all to no avail in locating one wild goose of a phrase saying there was renewed effort on making overtone more useable so people can do cool shit. For a while I could swear it was Ivan’s voice I heard saying it. Well, it was actually the end of a different podcast. Perhaps the wires that got crossed were FoC and HoC. The important thing is that the supercollider of my mind has been thoroughly re-patched. And for that I thank you all! Also Clojure is cool. That’s my Ideology :)

Two related questions:






* Is there any good research about using [call graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_graph) to create some metrics about the quality of a software architecture? (Since I've never looked into it — what's the state-of-the-art in measuring software quality, anyhow? I'm more interested in a quality architecture than bugs-per-line-of-code or something, I guess.)
* Any favorite tool for visualizing call graphs for JavaScript or PHP? 



My intuition would tend to say that messy call graphs indicate a worse architecture, but I haven't visualized many and I'm not sure how well that idea holds up in the "real world". Maybe call graphs end up being too messy in real programs.

[Psychology of Programming Interest Group Call for Papers](http://www.ppig.org/content/ppig-2020-call-papers)

> The 31st Annual Meeting of the Psychology of Programming Interest Group will be hosted for the first time in North America, at OCAD University's Inclusive Design Research Centre in Toronto, Canada, during the week of July 29-31, 2020.

## From our Community

[Catalog of Visual Math Tools](https://github.com/prathyvsh/Visual-Math-Tools/) ([Slack Thread](https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1580126222205200))

**Mike Travers** joins our slack and introduces himself and his work. He worked at MIT MediaLab long time ago on [Behave!](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~mt/behave/behave.html) an interesting block based visual language for simple agent programming, that was one of the ancestor of Scratch. He now works on visual programming based on Blockly to help scientist build queries to scientific data (see this [presentation](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qabtwa4p6u48gfy/enflame-clojure-meetup.pdf)).

**Mariano Guerra** shared a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqTLUAWCM4M) showing an educational prototype to produce HTML pages using Blockly to learn what HTML structure looks like without having to worry about syntax at first. The prototype is [online](https://marianoguerra.github.io/bloques-web/) (in Spanish) and its sources are on [GitHub](https://github.com/marianoguerra/bloques-web).

Jonathan Blow talking about his past, of course about games, but also about programming today, open source, C++, Rust, the future of programming, and many other issues people here will be interested in (and/or annoyed by his perspective ;-): [On the Metal Podcast: Jonathan Blow](https://oxide.computer/blog/on-the-metal-9-jonathan-blow/) ([Slack Thread](https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1580480732286100)) via **Stefan Lesser**

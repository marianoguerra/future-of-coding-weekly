I've built a structured editor using go for my language. This one is a TUI based interface.

Just had a meeting with my user. Singular. He's been busy writing code, and the code is working, and he's starting to feel competent with the tool. So I have a guy trained as a lawyer doing legal knowledge representation in a constraint answer set programming language, without help, and validating that code as accurate with the help of other non-coders. Zero to one. Woo! 🎉

Since getting laid off at shopify, I've been trying to do a bit more on side projects. I've been streaming building an arm assembler that is serving as the basis for a programming language I want to build. At the simplest level, I want a dynamically typed language that compiles straight to machine code (not aot). But ultimately, I want this to serve as a platform for experimenting with features a lot of languages don't have.



Off stream I've been working on my editor, right now learning the bare minimum of shaders so I can play with some effects and think about ways an editor could look and work.



If anyone has thoughts or ideas on either of these topics, happy to hear them.

...“Computer” is a Misnomer, “Function” is a Misnomer, “CPU” is a Misnomer, Mathematics Notation, Verbatim, How?...



The ultimate goal is to enable the use of diagrams as syntax (DaS).  This is but a step in that direction.



... “RT” is like assembler with a recursive syntax, instead of a line-oriented syntax ...

AI autocompletion like Copilot was just the beginning - we're going to be getting more agents trying to automate much of the process of software engineering. The future of coding is starting to look like management.

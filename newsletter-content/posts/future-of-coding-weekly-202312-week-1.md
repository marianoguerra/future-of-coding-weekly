Hi all, I've been inactive here for a long time. Progress on my big project, a collaborative mobile-friendly development environment, has been very slow. However, along the way I've built some libraries which may be of interest to some people here.



On the languages and parsing side, I've built [recursive grammar literals](https://github.com/jhp/recursive-grammar-literal) which lets you write CFGs as normal javascript functions. And [church-cat](https://github.com/jhp/church-cat) which lets you compute over a tree structure, e.g. annotate a parse tree.



On the UI side I've built [imperative](https://github.com/jhp/imperative) which is a frontend javascript library much like React, but based on generators and structured concurrency. And most recently I've been working on [Palimpsest](https://github.com/jhp/palimpsest) which covers the backend of web development with a more functional or "event-sourced" style where data sources are computed as folds over input streams. My interest there is to allow stateful applications to be more easily shared, forked, and extended by their users etc.

Statecharts - my reading of Harel’s original paper in video format (26 minutes) . (In case it’s not obvious, IMO it’s worth knowing about Statecharts, even if you believe that VPLs are a dead end).

Howdy friends! I recently published the beginnings of a new project: [wigwam.directory](https://wigwam.directory)



I'm looking for projects that reduce public reliance on bloated/crumbling infrastructure. Any suggestions?

I have written a short essay on software sustainability, and I'd love feedback from this community:

It's written in the specific context of computational science, but it readily translates to other application domains.

We just published a new demo of Plato's PBD subsystem. Much more powerful than our previous implementation.



PBD is historically difficult to generalize and make practical, but it seems that once you take it out of the desktop metaphor and apply it to relational data where queries are more explicit, it does quite well.



I suspect this could become the most prevalent way of automating app logic without coding.

Hi All

I’m almost “done” with my VR visual/spatial programming app, Pebble Graphics 🎉 (“done” because I still see a lot of things that could be improved, but there are other projects I’m excited to start so I’m shipping what I have). It’s a VR version of turtle graphics with some interactive program stepping and 3D visualizations of things like state change and execution history.

I made a trailer you can watch (and listen to 🎶) here [Pebble Graphics Trailer](https://youtu.be/Fl3DjzTdUo8?si=bWi7CWwbXIQh_wUw). If you have a Quest headset and want to try it out, I set up a Beta release while I try to get it into Meta’s App Lab app store. This link [meta.com/s/2Rlda8ess](https://www.meta.com/s/2Rlda8ess) should work otherwise feel free to DM me the email address associated with your Oculus/Meta account.

I also have some time-stamped/annotated videos later on in this [Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhmEEtPzG7mW4JrBUhwbo3al6HjaJsDp2) in case you want to see more.

I’m more of a lurker in this slack, but it’s a community I enjoy checking on and it’s really cool to see it grow!

>Pebble Graphics is a 3D visual and interactive programming system that lets you create and explore geometric patterns in virtual reality. Using simple commands, you can control Pebbles the dog to draw lines and shapes with programming. You can also step through your programs interactively, and see unique 3D visualizations of how things change over time. Pebble Graphics is a fun and creative way to learn basic ideas in programming.

I released the hopefully final feature last night for my mobile-friendly REPL: file loading and saving.



[Version ao: saving your programs across restarts](https://akkartik.itch.io/carousel/devlog/641310/version-ao-saving-your-programs-across-restarts)



From here on out I only want to work on UI polish and accessibility. Let's see how long it can stay running without incompatibilities that require upgrades.

I'm starting to acquire some respect for small UX niceties like a visual 'clicked' state. It's unnerving to click 'save' and not know for sure that stuff got saved. Particularly on a small mobile screen where it's easy to fat finger things.

🎥 [Advent of Code 2023 day 1 using visual programming](https://youtu.be/xPfCAPZlAzo) via [Maikel van de Lisdonk](https://www.devhelpr.com/)

Last year I used the advent of code to test the visual programming environment that I was building at that time.. and it helped me to come to the conclusion to start over.. which I did at the beginning of this year. So... the time has come to test my new environment and let advent of code help me improve and extend it. Hopefully this year I won't need to decide to start over😅. To finish the first challenge I needed to extend my vps with new node types or tweak some other stuff like be able to execute regex expressions and load external files as input to a flow. For the second part of day 1 a special node needed to be created to handle the sneaky replace string functionality that was needed. A very nice update that I made is the possibility to run parts of flow in parallel instead of sequential and use the results in the upstream nodes. 

And talking about upstream nodes... since last week it's also possible to drag all upstream or downstream nodes at once when reorganizing a flow using UI elements(it can be seen in the video). 

In the flow-engine I also use standalone nodes that represent global variables which can be used in other nodes. 



I'll definitely not make it to the AoC leaderboard (it's not a goal anyway).. however.. I think I am getting a lot of value out of this already..even on day 1.

Been making slow, but steady progress on my editor. I can properly zoom in and out on the canvas. I can have some panes that represent sub-file things. The power usage when idle is basically non-existent (down from 100% cpu usage always). I finally feel like things are starting to come together and that I can finish up some parts and then really start focusing on actually making the flow and features fit how I code.



Hopefully soon I can start using it for a project that isn't coding itself so I am forced to add all the features I've been ignoring.

Where's the emacs people in this text centric brave new world?



Context:  the most interesting stuff done on text always happened on emacs, and it makes sense to use a text centric malleable software platform to experiment by adding LLMs to everything, I haven't seen much done there.

Thinking about a modern agent orchestration / business process modeling / workflow language. Here is how the standard BPMN example might look like:






```
# Tasks are enqueued jobs to specific queues. They emit events like started, success, failure, cancelled as well as custom intermediate events.

# Tasks cannot consume events. Task invoker can cancel those tasks.

# Tasks are triggerred by specific events indicated by their corresponding "when" clause.

# Process is a stateful workflow which orchestrates tasks based on events.



process pizza() do

    x = @customer.select_pizza when $start

    y = @customer.order_pizza(kind: x.kind) when x

    z = @chef.make_pizza(order: y.order) when y

    

    p = y.order.line_items.map do |item| # array processing

        subprocess procure(item: item) #invoke a subprocess

    end when z

    q = @clerk.pack when p.all?

    

    w = @delivery_boy.deliver_pizza(to: y.address) when z

    u = @customer.pay_for_pizza when w

    v = @customer.eat_pizza when u

    success $hunger_satisfied when v



    r = @customer.ask_for_pizza when (y or r[-1] + 60.minutes) and w.pending?

    s = @clerk.calm_the_customer when r

end
```

hi! tinyletter (the service I use for the FoC newsletter) is closing down, to finish the last stage of going completely self hosted I plan to export the subscriber list, put it in a csv, do a for loop and use some mail api to send it. Also a form somewhere that appends to that csv. But before adopting this webscale architecture ™  I wanted to ask you



 *if there's any interesting idea to improve the newsletter now that I'm doing the migration* .

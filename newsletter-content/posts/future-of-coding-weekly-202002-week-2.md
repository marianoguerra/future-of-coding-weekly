**New Future of Coding Podcast** [#44 - Making Your Own Tools: Devine Lu Linvega | Future of Coding](https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/044) by [Ivan Reese](https://twitter.com/spiralganglion)

> Devine Lu Linvega and his partner Rekka live on a sailboat. He makes art, music, software, and other cultural artifacts. When Photoshop’s DRM required that he maintain a connection to the internet, he wrote his own creative suite. When his MacBook died in the middle of the ocean, he switched to Linux with hardware he could service. His electricity comes from solar panels, and every joule counts — so that’s out with Chrome and Electron and in with Scheme, C, assembly, and maybe someday Forth.

[Anders Hejlsberg on Modern Compiler Construction](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Seth-Juarez/Anders-Hejlsberg-on-Modern-Compiler-Construction). By [Anders Hejlsberg](https://twitter.com/ahejlsberg) via **Daniel**

> In this video Anders a great foundation of compiler construction by describing the traditional methodologies that have been used in the last 30 or so years. He then uses that foundation to describe modern tooling needs and how compilers have adapted to meet increasing demands.

> We often hear that Apple's ecosystem of apps (or Microsoft's, or Google's) are "walled gardens". But what about the individual applications themselves?

[Arcan](https://arcan-fe.com/about/) is a powerful development framework for creating virtually anything between user interfaces for specialised embedded applications all the way to full-blown standalone desktop environments. Boot splash screen? no problem. Custom Interface for your Home Automation Project? sure thing. Stream media processing? Of course.

This week on Slack, [a fun prompt](https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1580718026447200) from Brandon Hudgeons (via Kartik Agaram):

> You get to name an assertion the ___ Paradox (fill in your last name). What do you choose?

Come [join Slack](https://futureofcoding.org/community) and start a new thread about your paradox!

Operon 0.5.0 is out, find it from [https://operon.io](https://operon.io) (Java-binary and pdf-booklet) by [OperonGuy](https://twitter.com/OperonGuy) ([Slack Thread](https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/CCL5VVBAN/p1580674741033000))

> It is also the first public release and I'm hoping for feedback on the most rudimentary things; did you get the queries running (if you had a chance to try)? What was your initial impression on the language? Did you encounter anything illogical or that you could consider as possible design flaw?
> 
> I have not yet documented everything, so there's more to come on later releases. Also none of the components were yet released, so it is just the core that is out now. Love to hear back from you!

Summary of a paper: [Paper; Didn't Read - Statecharts: A Visual Formalism For Complex Systems](https://instadeq.com/blog/posts/paper-didnt-read-statecharts-a-visual-formalism-for-complex-systems/) by [instadeq](https://twitter.com/instadeq)

[Thomas Ballinger](https://twitter.com/ballingt) wrote some posts about "Observable for Jupyter Users".

-   [Differences between Jupyter and Observable](https://observablehq.com/d/b00406054cfb4875)
-   [Visualize a data frame with Observable](https://observablehq.com/d/eceaa744227c4fea)
-   [Interactivity in Observable](https://observablehq.com/d/c4e1459a8a99cdaf)
-   [Bonus: JavaScript for Python Programmers](https://observablehq.com/d/5e82392bae5fb729)

A lively discussion in the [Slack Thread](https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/CCL5VVBAN/p1580753303039100)

> I'd be particularly interested in whether you think I'm identifying the differences in workflow in a digestible way. The goal is that these are tutorials, not marketing documents, if there's a difference. I guess they're marketing documents for programmers, not CEOs.

Improved the interface, fixed event reasoning, and restyled the scenario editor to look like a Gov't of Canada webpage. Code in the picture, result in the gif.

Finally fixed glitches in Lamdu’s resize, so we can showcase our automatic layout quite nicely!

TaxyAI repo has been removed and the site now redirects to [adept.ai](http://adept.ai). I started a fresh browser extension project to replicate that and more: [github.com/aicombinator/browser-extension](https://github.com/aicombinator/browser-extension)

tried out recording myself talking for my weekly update this week. may or may not keep doing this!

this week: some progress on video-editing, and why I love data validation

I have been creating a graph-based notetaking app; I am curious about the current landscape. I see Roam/Obsidian/Logseq sort of in the same category (with Obsidian Canvas as a feature with a lot of potential), and Tana (which I just learned about) goes one step further by nodifying more things. Are there any other killer features/products in this space?

I don't want to make something that already exists :)

I enjoyed this assessment.  I lived through the shift to recursion. I note, though, that recursion and functions make sense only for single-threaded pieces of hardware which is how CPUs and Memory were perceived in the 1950s.  Today, we can have bowls full of CPUs with their own local memories, which changes the ground truth about hardware.  While it is possible to extrapolate recursion to describe distributed systems, the recursive  mind-set leads to epicycles such as thread safety, multi-tasking operating systems, thread libraries, loops, etc., i.e. a generally horrible DX (Developer eXperience) for creating distributed programs.

> Online collaboration is becoming prevalent in our day-today work. As commercial applications show, next to texts, spreadsheets are an essential tool for storing and organizing shared data. However, concurrent modifications of a collaborative spreadsheet can lead to unexpected results when they reflect implementation decisions rather than user intention.



With this paper, we systematically discuss spreadsheet operations and their semantics and propose intention-preserving designs in a concurrent decentralized setting, thus supporting offline operations. We further explore different data models for shared spreadsheets based on composed Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) and give an implementation in the local-first framework Yjs.

Surprising to see this hasn’t (?) been shared in FoC yet

>Collaborative writing tools don’t work well for writers or editors. With Upwelling, we demonstrate a design that gives writers privacy while still offering editors transparency into how a document is changing.

Does anyone know of a recent book that describes some of the efforts and thinking about the future of code?

Scrapscript is best understood through a few perspectives:




* “it’s JSON with types and functions and hashed references”
* “it’s tiny Haskell with extreme syntactic consistency”
* “it’s a language with a weird IPFS thing”

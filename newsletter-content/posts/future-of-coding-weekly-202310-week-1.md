This week I rewrote an older demo to work more like the more recent work I have done. It runs in 69s but have no commentary … 🤔

Yesterday I finished implementing the core functionality for the visual stepper in GRASP (and so I made this rather cheesy demo video)

💬 Graphical Command Interfaces



🐟 Stop asking dead questions



Prototype of a conversational UI that uses LLMs to reply to questions in human language with graphical and interactive UI components.

[Go To Statement Considered Harmful](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/362929.362947) is a solid classic entry in the [X Considered Harmful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Considered_harmful) metafiction genre, authored by renowned computer scientist and idiosyncratic grump, [Edsger Wybe Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra). Surprisingly (given the impact it's had) this is a minuscule speck of a paper, lasting only 1-ish pages, and it even digresses several times from the main point. Fear not! Jimmy and I spend the entirety of these two podcast hours thoroughly analyzing the paper, wringing every last drop of insight from it, speaking directly to how programming ought to be reimagined from the molten venture capital core on up. Yes indeed, this is another episode in the fine tradition of Future of Coding where we stay faithfully close to the text, we leave the second-order implications alone, and there's nothing more than that. Nothing portended, nothing changed.

I've been "building" an "instrument". Thanks to some samples from [Ivan Reese](http://ivanish.ca/).

Bubble sort is a simple algorithm and offcourse in a real-live scenario you won't implement this using a visual programming environment... however, it's a nice test-case to help building a visual programming environment because it needs to be able to modify an array amongst other things.. So I've introduced the concept of being able to send commands to an array-node. When items are swapped, this is visualized by the array-node with some borders flashing and changing colors around the items that are being swapped. [🎥 bubble sort implemented in a visual flow](https://youtu.be/Xp235l_YjCY) .. furthermore the array is iterated using a foreach-node which triggers a sub-flow for each array item.

Re: [Future of Coding](https://overcast.fm/p4449364-F69ROU) - Apple Vision & Dynamicland

Probably unpopular ideas, but here's my Black Mirror take:




* What's tasteful won't matter, as long as it's popular.
* Success of these "spatial computing" concepts will come from what gets the masses interested.
* Whatever will be successful, porn will do first, as they always have. Now the action is with you, or you're "there". Consent from other people actually with you is left as an exercise for the reader.
* Ditto for Snapchat-like filters that are applied to other people in the room with you. Everyone naked? Everyone's a furry? Maybe we present virtually as we choose for other goggle-heads? Back to consent again, for, "who wants to see the naked furry centaur in the coffee shop?"
* Extra points for integrating Dynamicland-like badges that people wear, interpreted by the goggles as, "don't VR-alter me." Another one for, "don't apply facial recognition to me." Naturally, law enforcement gets a version that the latter filter doesn't apply for, and the tech leaks to hacky patches for consumer hardware.

I'm making a basic color picker for my designed-for-children VR animation program (streaming development here [twitch.tv/hamish_todd/videos](https://www.twitch.tv/hamish_todd/videos)). Simple question: is it a good idea for "eraser" to be a "color" in my color picker, rather than its own button? Veeeeery limited number of buttons on a VR controller and I want to minimize menus!
